<h2>(PSA) Use the merchant in The Hunter's Dream in the early game!</h2>

<div id="307wln" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is just a quick tip for all the people who are just starting out or will be starting out in the next few days. The merchant in The Hunter&#39;s Dream is an invaluable resource in the early game. The most important thing that is sold is the Yharnam armor set, the entire set can be purchased for only 2,500 BE and will VASTLY improve your defense and survivability, especially if you are having trouble with either of the first two bosses. In addition to this the merchant sells all of the starters that you didn&#39;t choose as well as a few other fun early game weapons, all of which are fairly cheap. Blood Vials are also very cheap so if you deplete your whole stock grinding the first boss just farm some BE and restock!</p>

<p>tl;dr: Do not neglect the merchant in the early game, there are a lot of great things for sale that will make you life a little bit earier!</p>

<p>Hope this helps and happy Hunting!</p>

<p>Edit: Some people down in the comments told me about the Hunter&#39;s set of armor that I was previously unaware of. It can be found on the just off the Great Bridge (the bridge with the two werewolves and the first boss). When you first get onto the bridge the werewolves will be on your right, to your left is a staircase that will lead you down to a spot where you can overlook the angry mob burning the werewolf corpse. Follow this path and break a few boxes and you will be able to drop down into the sewers where you will find a body holding the set. I have not gotten it yet personally because this would involve quite a bit of backtracking but according to another user it is about comparable to the purchasable set but is slightly worse against non-physical attacks. In the end it will only take a few minutes to get the Hunter set or farm 2500 BE, so either one is a good option, the moral of the story is upgrade your armor ASAP if you like being alive!</p>

<p>Edit 2: Other weapons are only available after defeating the first boss. My apologies for the slight misinformation, I beat the first boss fairly quickly and had only returned to The Hunter&#39;s Dream the initial time before I beat it. Some people are saying that there is an alternate method of getting the badge to unlock the weapons by defeating the giant boar in the back of the sewers, but I do not know if this is true or not. If you do decide to fight the boar and are having any trouble with it there is any easy way to take it down. Right before the second boss there is a ladder that leads down into the sewers and will put you right behind the boar, if you charge your R2 you will stun it and be able to follow up with a Visceral Attack. This should instantly kill it, but even if it survives it will not be far from death. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Want to add that extra dark and creepiness into your everyday life even if you are away from Yharnam? Now you can with the ringing of the small resonant bell as your ringtone, to hopefully have it resonate out there and find a fellow Hunter beside you.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just found a safe place to farm blood, Blood Shards, and Twin Shards. This method works very much like the &quot;cheese&quot; spot for the werewolves in Central Yharnham.</p>

<p>After beating Blood-Starved Beast, teleport to the Cathedral Ward.  Walk outside, and kill the gravekeeper right outside the door. Tucked away in the corner is a tall cloaked enemy with a burlap sack over his shoulder. Purposely die to him, and you should get a cutscene. You&#39;ll be brought to a jail cell. Head up the stairs, and you will end up in a large room with 2 more of those tall cloaked bag dudes. Light the lantern at the top of the small set of stairs while avoiding them.
NOW the farming can begin. Just aggro them, and lure them down the stair case. Those idiots are so tall, their head gets stuck running into the cieling. You can now safely poke them to death. Each of them are worth 1300+ Souls, 2 Shard per kill or 1 Twin Blood Stone Shard. Once they are dead, use the lantern to go back to the Hunter&#39;s Dream. Instead of using the normal headstone to teleport, go farther up the stairs and use the other one instead. You should have a new location (Hypogean Gaol). Rinse and repeat. Be careful, they hit like a fucking truck.</p>

<p>Happy hunting~</p>

<h2>Best Farming Spots So Far</h2>

<button onclick="toggles('30he3z')">View full post</button>
<div id="30he3z" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So yesterday I discovered a good farming spot that got me about 40,000 echos in maybe 15 minutes. Now for some people in NG+ that may not sound like much but I was level 30 before I discovered the spot. In one hour of using this method I was able to buy all of the available armor, all weapons and guns, and add 15 levels to my character. </p>

<p>The location for this farming technique is the Lecture Building, I&#39;m not going to post how to get there because of potential spoilers. The enemies in this area are extremely weak and I one shot them with the Holy Blade +6 with fire gem. The fire gem fortification is a MUST at low levels!</p>

<p>Here is the method I use for the fastest results:</p>

<p>Gain access to the lecture hall and unlock all of the doors. You will notice that there are two rooms with only one enemy and a room with about 20 enemies. Go to the room with 20 enemies and carefully kill them all. Next go to a room with only one enemy in it and die. This seems to improve the loading time as you don&#39;t have to go back to the dream and teleport back in. Recover your souls rinse and repeat. Each cycle gets you around 15,000 per run. If you die in the hall with the 20 enemies in it ensure that you get your souls back before attacking the mob. As an added bonus these enemies drop QS bullets and sedatives. </p>

<p>TL:DR
The above method gets you roughly 15,000 blood echos in 5 mins or less! 
Please share your farming spots that you have found!</p>

<p>Make sure to equip the runes &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;Eye&quot; in order to get more echos. Thanks wgg88!</p>

<ul>
<li>However you end up in the Hunter&#39;s Dream, DO NOT leave without picking up your weapon. Of the 3 choices, the Hunter&#39;s Axe is probably the best one for a beginner. The little ghosty guys on the ground give it to you.</li>
<li>I&#39;m going to bold this one, because reading the negative reviews they all seem to be missing this important concept: <strong>Most areas have just 1 &#39;checkpoint&#39;. Progress in an area is attained by unlocking shortcuts.</strong> If you find an iron gate with a message like &quot;closed by some device&quot;. That gate, is your progress marker. You can look straight through most of the time and see the lever that opens it on the other side. Your goal, is to reach that lever. These shortcuts chain together creating an easy path to the boss with maybe 5-20 enemies instead of 50-80 of them. Elevators work the same way as gates. If you find an elevator be sure to ride it once quickly as riding it is what activates it, allowing the levers on both sides of it to call it to the floor you are on.</li>
<li>Every enemy has a tactical weakness. This weakness is what you hope to learn before you die. Many enemies have similar weaknesses. For example - werewolves always attack straight ahead. If you lock on and quickstep dodge to their left their main attack will miss, leaving their backside exposed. They are easy to stagger, and thus when you get this opening, lay into them. Just make sure you keep enough stamina to dodge again when your onslaught is over.</li>
<li>Lock on quickstep dodging is key in boss fights, and single enemy fights. Pressing the right joystick in will lock you on to a target. You will then notice that the dodge button now springs you very quickly instead of rolling you. When fighting a boss don&#39;t just attack wildly, try to dodge until their attack misses, and then exploit the brief opening with a few weapon strikes.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapon at the workshop. In all FROM games the most noticeable increase in power comes from upgrading your weapon. Stats help, bloodgems (later on) help a lot, but ultimately you will get enough materials for free to +6 around 4-6 weapons, without farming. You will get enough to +3 every weapon in the game, so don&#39;t save that little bit of damage for later, upgrade your weapon straight away.</li>
<li>If you are used to a weapon, don&#39;t switch. All weapons have vastly different move sets, stat scaling, etc. Typically you will build an entire character on subsequent play-throughs around a specific weapon. That being said I would encourage you to, as you progress, get all the weapons and try them all out. </li>
<li>In the first area pay attention to which enemies drop 2 bloodvials. They almost always drop 2 and can be used early on and later in the game to replenish your bloodvials so you don&#39;t run out. If you can learn / remember where they are you can form a workable path to use to farm more should you start running out.</li>
<li>If you can survive the game up to 10 insight (the eye icon in the hud) you can get the small beckoning bell in the hunter&#39;s dream to join in other&#39;s games in co-op. Co-oping in someone else&#39;s game before a boss can help you learn that boss without risking your experience. You can level up for the first time in the hunter&#39;s dream after getting 1 insight point. This will happen from either seeing any boss, or using a item that you can find which will give you 1 insight. This will also cause some messengers to show up on the stairs into the workshop in the hunter&#39;s dream that will give you the bell to summon other players into your world. </li>
<li>Boss rooms throughout the game are typically obvious. The dev&#39;s also like to place a <strong>Bold Hunters Mark</strong> on a body near most boss rooms. If you just picked up a bold hunter&#39;s mark and are loaded with Blood Echoes (experience/money) my advice would be to look for the shortcut path back to the lantern if you haven&#39;t found it, or if you have - use the mark to go cash out your echoes so you can return without the weight of that potential loss when you start on the boss.</li>
<li>Get in the habit of rolling through the garbage (circle button), but be careful around cliffs and ledges. Near those smash with your weapon. Items and pathways to shortcuts often hide behind piles of garbage.</li>
<li>Stop and read the notes (the little grey pools on the ground). While there <strong>are</strong> some deceptive notes, I&#39;d say around 80% are helpful, and a few of them are quite funny (adult humor). If you leave a note of your own that&#39;s funny or helpful and someone rates it as &quot;fine&quot; while you are online, it will heal you wherever you are in the world. If you leave a lot of helpful notes, this can start to happen during boss fights, etc. The notes with a shining thing in the center are dev notes, and often give little clues about the nature of the world and lore.</li>
<li>ALL NPCS are bound to the same contract as monsters. You can attack and kill any and every npc in the game without any exceptions. In some cases this will make the game harder or instantly end a side quest. If you accidentally hit an npc and they don&#39;t get angry with you, you are ok. Try to be mindful of your weapons around important npcs though. A special note about this is that enemies are also subject to falling deaths, the same as you are. I can think of one that this is quite helpful on.</li>
<li>Retreat IS an option. More than that its an acceptable one. If you enter an area or round a corner and are faced with 3-5 enemies, immediately dodging backwards and retreating to the area you&#39;ve already cleared to avoid making a fatal mistake is a very good idea. I do this often myself. There are notes about ambushes and when you see one, take heed of it. Most enemies will leash (give up the chase) at some point. If you get jumped, retreating and sprinting to get back to a more open area or even a choke point to deal with the mob, is often a much safer way to deal with the situation.</li>
<li>NPC Doors are marked throughout the game with a red colored lantern on the ground. If you see a red lantern on the ground search nearby for a &quot;Talk&quot; option. Some of them start up quests for additional rewards and content, so its worth talking to them. </li>
</ul>

<p>I think that&#39;s about all I can give without being more direct. The MOST important tip is no. 2 in the list. Unlocking shortcuts = progress. The first 2 bosses with the right shortcuts can be gotten to in less than a few minutes. There&#39;s a lot more, including gun parrying + visceral attacks which help a lot with the 2nd boss, but you can look all that up online.</p>

<p>That being said, good luck. If you can tough out the initial learning, unlock some shortcuts, learn how they change the level for you, and upgrade your weapon a bit while learning how to hit without being hit, then you will be on your way to understanding why the game is getting the praise it does. It&#39;s worth toughing it out. Beating this game as a &quot;New Player&quot; is akin to the video game version of climbing mount everest. There is a tipping point though, where once you &quot;get it&quot; the game will get a lot easier. You&#39;ll be able to farm, level up, call in allies on tough boss fights and find yourself staring at the credits screen, ready to try a new build, or PvP, or New Game+ (which is even harder) or Chalice Dungeons.</p>

<p>This is your shot at probably the most rewarding feeling you will ever get from a game. So as the notes in front of most bosses read, &quot;Don&#39;t give up!&quot;</p>

<div id="30wpo3" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s what I’ve gleaned about the plot of Bloodborne.  A lot of this is based off item descriptions (some of which are cited, but I don’t have the references right in front of me so exact names aren’t always used).  There is a good mixture of conjecture in here, which I’ll mark with asterisks.  The rest is based off item descriptions, though I’ve attempted to weave them into the narrative for sake of reading, so take everything here with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Be warned, there are plenty of spoilers in here, including lots of late-game stuff.  Also, let me know if I’m wrong on anything, or any alternate theories you guys have.  I’d love to hear what you think!</p>

<p>Pthumeria and the Pthumerians</p>

<p>Pthumeria was an ancient civilization ruled by Queen Yharnam.  It was populated by Pthumerians, an ancient race of people who truly understood the Truth of the Great Ones and gained supernatural powers as a result.  <em>Queen Yharnam was a medium for the Great Ones, as cited by an item (saying the Choir discovered a medium, though she’s the only likely candidate).</em>  Eventually the Pthumerians retreated into a deep labyrinth, with their holy chalices being the only remnants of their ancient rituals to break the seals.  Some chalices (such as the ailing Loran chalice) led to other lands, and the Isz Chalice was in particular used in holy communion with the Great Ones.</p>

<p>Byrgenwerth</p>

<p>A scholar named Willem discovered the labyrinth and learned of the Truth of the Great Ones (though he didn’t learn it).  Seeking to better understand it, he founded the Byrgenwerth lecture hall, where his students would attempt to understand the Great Ones and even surpass them.  Willem had two followers that he sent down into the labyrinth to learn the Truth; both these individuals went insane.  One of them (I can’t remember their names) became the keeper of the graveyard, while the other became the holy gatekeeper who demands a password to enter the forbidden forest (seen dead in the chair at the other side of the door).</p>

<p>At some point, in order to gain better insight into the Truth, Willem decided it best to give his brain eyes (as you do).  This, of course, failed, resulting in his blindness and subsequent madness.  In addition, the students there (and Willem) discovered that part of the Truth was that humans were done evolving in the natural sense; what was left now was a metamorphosis into something greater.  While some would become infected monsters, others, such as the tentacle-headed pale man-monster who sucks out your insight, are actually listed as “transformed” or “metamorphosed,” implying that they’ve “evolved” in the sense that Willem was hoping to do.</p>

<p>It should be noted that after Willem went mad, the students practiced his teachings much more haphazardly, doing so for the prestige of having done so rather than the acquisition of knowledge.  <em>This likely resulted in the rejects bug-headed creatures left in the place.  It could also potentially be the reason why there is an infestation of snakes in the Forbidden Woods, with the metamorphosis spreading like a plague.</em></p>

<p>Subsequently…</p>

<p>Rom, the Vacuous Spider, and the Great Ones</p>

<p>Rom is a legitimate Great One.  However, in the temple of Oedon, there is a note saying that “The Byrgenwerth Spider keeps our lord from us.  It is most frustrating.”  The Lake runes also state that “the lake keeps the essence of the Great Ones under control, suppressing it beneath its gentle waves” or something similar.  This suggests that Rom is, in fact, trapped in the Moonlight Lake.</p>

<p>The other great ones include Amygdala, Ebrietas, Mergo’s Wet Nurse, and Oedon.  A note on a few of them.</p>

<p>Oedon:  Oedon is perhaps the most important of the Great Ones.  He is formless (as stated in many runes), but Rom blocks him from this world, which in my mind implies that Oedon’s influence comes in the form of the red moon.  His words, which are the only form he has, were listened to and transcribed by Caryll, who made them into runes of power.  More on all that later.</p>

<p>Ebrietas:  The Daughter of the Cosmos is the “Last Great One,” and it is implied that all augurs (such as slugs and phantasms) are her pets that she gave to the Choir.  She seems to mourn the body of a massive spider that has a strange effect with time, judging by the effect is has on the Queenly Flesh.  <em>This could mean that Rom did in fact die, but his essence was locked away in the Moonlight Lake to seal Oedon off from the world, or it could be a wholly unrelated creature.</em></p>

<p>Mergo:  It is implied that Mergo is a god child.  His Wet Nurse is a Great One, <em>and the implications of Queen Yharnam standing beneath his battle before the Wet Nurse is defeated seem to suggest that she is in fact a true God Child born to this world.  In my opinion, it means that Mergo was conceived by Queen Yharnam, but was likely stillborn, judging by all the blood on her dress and a description on Mensis’s Cage (more later).</em></p>

<p>Amygdala:  This giant spider-like goddess is the lord of the spiders of the nightmare realms, and in fact lives inside nightmares.  It is said in several item descriptions that her kind are basically gods, and all worship her.  It is also said that they live in nightmares and are more likely than most gods to respond to the cries of people in the waking world.  <em>This is supported by the fact that the two places they appear are in the Oedon Cathedral/Grand Cathedral (where they were obviously venerated) and Yahar’ghul, where statues of them are common and so are they.</em>  Interesting fun fact:  the amygdala is the fear/anger center of the brain, and looks incredibly similar to their heads.  They live in nightmares, and the tonsil you are given (which looks like their head) is followed with the instructions to “receive the gift of the god head.”  In this sense, they are basically fear, anger, and nightmares personified.</p>

<p>*Mensis and Yahar’ghul, the Unseen Village (MOSTLY CONJECTURE)</p>

<p>After the sanity of Willem passed, many people came to see Byrgenwerth and scavenge what secrets they could find.  One of these individuals was Mensis, who conceived the notion of locking away his sense of self to more closely commune with the Great Ones.  He founded Yahar’ghul, and took to having hunters who would look across the land and take people back, sacrificing children to summon the Great Ones.  Most saw them as insane, but the people of Yahar’ghul were devoted to their leaders.  Eventually, Mensis attempted to conceive a Great One himself (possibly with Queen Yharnam), and conceived of a great nightmare to house it (likely due to his worship of Amygdala, goddess of nightmares).  Alas, this child was stillborn, being only a brain with eyes.  In his nightmare, this likely resulted in the massive brain with eyes, as well as the maddening women with the same kinds of heads.  Still, it continued to inspire many worshippers. (based on many item descriptions)</p>

<p>It’s my personal theory (total conjecture) that the bells that are used in the game are inventions of this place, as the bellkeeper maidens seem to be here more than anywhere else.  After all, they were quite adept at calling across the worlds, and the only other place the bellkeeper maidens are present are the Nightmare Frontier, the Nightmare of Mensis, and the Chalice Dungeons.  Conversely, there is also a possibility that the bellkeeper maidens originated in the Nightmare Frontier and are creations of Amygdala.*</p>

<p>*The Lecture Hall and the students (ALSO MOSTLY CONJECTURE)</p>

<p>With its close connection to the Nightmare Frontier, it’s not a stretch to imagine that the melted students were once students of a prestigious academy in Yahar’ghul (especially considering the fact that the institute can only be reached by two places, both of which are located there).  There is a note in there that says something along the lines of “kill the Great Ones” or “Hunt the Great Ones” or “Surpass the Great ones” (I don’t recall), and there is evidence via the student uniforms to suggest that these students attempted to truly understand nightmares and the Great Ones (likely specifically Amygdala) and were either too timid, failed, or simply floundered in their research, becoming what they are now.  It is also entirely possible that Patches and the other human-headed spiders are the result of what happened to true worshippers who transformed, since they have the same face colors.*</p>

<p>The Healing Church and the Choir</p>

<p>Perhaps the most influential of the organizations, the Healing Church was founded in the wake of the Choir.  There were three echelons to the church:  black-garbed hunters, white-garbed “doctors,” and the Choir.  Though they did not spring from Byrgenwerth directly, they were explorers who found the labyrinth in the wake of that place and discovered the same remnants of the Truth, and used the research done there already to kick off their own research.  However, their form of metamorphosis began with Blood Ministrations.  In addition, once the church gained enough influence, it shut off all access to the Forbidden Woods <em>(though for fear of the plague of snakes or to restrict anyone else from getting in [principally giving them a monopoly on the Byrgenwerth research], I have no idea).</em></p>

<p>Blood Ministrations:  The art of using blood for healing.  It spread fast and hard, and the church used it for everything.  The pungent cocktail suggests that it even replaced alcohol in Yharnam for how intoxicating it was.  The church rose quickly to incredible prestige for the healing qualities of the blood.</p>

<p>Ashen Blood:  Eventually, Old Yharnam was founded (obviously just “Yharnam” at the time), but it was brought low by a strange (the text says “baffling”) illness known as Ashen Blood, which was a worse form of slow/fast poison.  The antidote description cites it as being a more severe case, and in the case of Ashen Blood, the antidotes only provided temporary relief.  Eventually, the disease <em>(likely spread due to blood ministrations)</em> took over, and those infected turned into beasts.  This is why the beasts in Old Yharnam are poisonous, particularly the red-eyed werewolf near the boss, and why the Blood-Starved Beast is coated with poison.  After the fall of Old Yharnam, it was closed up, and Central Yharnam was built, along with the Grand Cathedral.  This is perhaps he first instance of “hunters” as we know them now being formed.</p>

<p>Black-Garbed Hunters:  Though amateur doctors, the black-garbed hunters were an extermination force and a prevention, not a cure.  Their goal was to kill those who were infected, turned, and those who may be infected, which made their garb synonymous with fear.</p>

<p>White-Garbed Hunters:  Though they were “doctors,” they sought to do the bidding of the Choir, and would apply blood ministrations with the intent of experimentation, rather than healing.  Many of the twisted things the church produced were a result of this experimentation.  The great giants (with axes and wrecking balls) as well as the grave keepers near them are products of these experiments, and are legendary beasts that would join the church on the hunt.</p>

<p>The Choir:  The leaders of the church, The Choir truly believed they could commune with the Great Ones and learn their Truth.  They believed they could ascend to the Cosmos (or at least make contact with it, as implied by the gesture), and it came in a sudden and unexpected realization that perhaps while their feet were rooted to the ground, the cosmos was not immeasurably far away, but right above their heads.  Together with Ebrietas, they worked tirelessly to understand the Great One’s Truth.</p>

<p>The Orphanage:  Children were abducted from the streets of Yharnam and experimented upon, locked away inside this orphanage to become “brilliant minds.”  In fact, they became celestial hosts (the big bulbous headed blue guys).  <em>One of them even became a Great One (as indicated by the Celestial Emissary boss), or perhaps was already a Great One that guided them.</em>  There is quite a hell of a lot of evidence to suggest that Iosefka is either a member of the Choir or the White-Garbed Hunters (didn’t look closely enough at her garb at the time), which is why she believes that transforming victims sent to her is considered “healing them.”  <em>However, this does raise implications as to what exactly you are, since you woke up in her clinic.</em></p>

<p>Other Notables:  Ludwig was a famous warrior of the church, as evidenced by his sword and rifle which are now (at least in the case of the latter) common amongst the church hunters.  Archibald was also an eccentric of the church, obsessed with darkbeasts and replicating their bolts.  Gascoigne and his partner who’s name I forget were also once members of the church before parting ways due to ideological differences.</p>

<p>The Great Ones:  While it would appear they worshipped all the Great Ones, of particular note in the Healing Church are Amygdala and Oedon, whom there are churches dedicated to.  It is not known if they worshipped Rom or Ebrietas.</p>

<p>Caryll</p>

<p>Caryll was a member of the Workshop (more on that later) that was able to hear the voice of Oedon, and managed to inscribe his words into runes, which (according to item descriptions) would have made Willem proud.  While the runes themselves are a singular thing, their descriptions are incredibly varied and moreso tend to tinge the lore here and there with extra information.</p>

<p>The Workshop and the Heretics</p>

<p>In time, a man named Gherman would rise to the task of taking care of the Beast problem.  Redesigning his clothes to provide defense against their claws, Gherman also took to creating the Burial Blade, a unique weapon that was made out of Starlite, a metal made from the heavens.  He also created the Mercy Blades from the same material, which would later be used by Eileen.  Gherman’s work was so admired that his methods and trick weapons would become the basis for all hunter technology in the future.  <em>While it doesn’t say specifically, there is a heavy implication that Gherman was hired by the Church of Healing to work in the Workshop, due to his familiarity with it and its location beneath the Healing Church’s cathedral.</em></p>

<p>Gherman worked in the Workshop presumably until his death.  He took many apprentices, who all did his duty in his honor, and may well have died long ago.  The bone in the workshop graveyard was one of such apprentices, who had mastered the art of Quickening, allowing his stamina to recover faster and his rolls to function better.</p>

<p>There were others, however.  Notably, the Powder Kegs were a group of hunters that tried to make explosive weapons, to varying degrees of success (the Stake Driver, the Rifle Spear, and the Cannon are all such devices).  However, due to differences in designs, they were banned from the Workshop, becoming known as Workshop Heretics.</p>

<p>Cainhurst, The Vilebloods, and the Executioners</p>

<p>In Cainhurst Castle, Queen Annalise was a ruler over many nobles and dandies who learned of the Healing Church’s Blood Ministrations.  Having little to no scruples, they decided to take their fill of blood where they could find it, and gained a nasty reputation for their habit of hunting down hunters and taking blood dregs, draughts of their blood.  Eventually, Annalise became immortal as a result of her vile predations, and an eternal society of vampires was formed in Cainhurst.  It was a place of refinement and sophistication, and the occasional beast that arose from the foul practice was dispatched discreetly and with artisanship (as stated in the outfit).  Those who served the queen did so out of loyalty, fear, and an unending desire to taste her blood, and settled with various Caryll runes that improved Visceral Attacks as a cheap substitute (as described in the rune’s texts).  Queen Annalise hoped desperately one day to bear a true heir, and dubbed this the Child of Blood, which she sought to have at all costs.  She sent her Vilebloods to hunt for her, and all hoped that, with enough blood dregs, she could birth a Child of Blood.</p>

<p>However, the Healing Church took these practices as an affront, and Master Logarius founded the Executioners; battle-thirsty zealots looking to kill Vilebloods at all costs.  Eventually they stormed Cainhurst, killing everyone so violently their spirits linger on to this day.  However, Logarius martyred himself in order to prevent the queen from ever escaping; he sent his Executioners away and sat upon a throne where he could forever keep guard.  It is said that only one with the crown of illusions could see the entrance to the queen’s lair, and Logarius donned this crown that none could ever see it.</p>

<p>Eileen the Crow, Hunter of Hunters</p>

<p>In time, hunters needed to receive blood ministrations in order to compete with the beasts they hunted, as a kind of all-or-nothing gamble.  However, many hunters would fail, and become obsessed with, infected by, and eventually overcome by the blood, becoming beasts themselves.  For this, the Hunter of Hunters did their duty, ending the lives of these madmen with grace and dignity.  Eileen’s set says that they were buried in a foreign and respectful way, rather than the vile way of Yharnam <em>(which I assume is cremation on a pyre or cross),</em> and references a sky burial.  However, there is one interesting note:  it says that the hope for the sky burial is that the hunters would find rest and solace in “a hunter’s dream.”  This leads me to some fairly open-ended speculation, but I need to start with the Red Moon and the Umbilical Cords.</p>

<p>The Red Moon</p>

<p>The Red Moon is a nightmare.  The servants of Amygdala are fully powered, the beasts are more ravenous, and the children of Amygdala are visible.  In this nightmare, the world reveals the eldritch abominations it has been truly hiding.  As a result, everything gets worse, and the character sees the world as they would if they had amassed 40 insight.  <em>Unfortunately, by killing Rom, you usher in the Red Moon, which I believe to be the coming of Oedon.  I do not think Oedon is the Moon Presence, but he very well could be.</em>  Regardless, this leads to my other point:</p>

<p>The Umbilical Cords</p>

<p>While this presents a weird part of the story, it is a known fact that 75% of the game’s umbilical cords can be found on women or children.  During the Red Moon, Iosefka’s dialogue suggests that she has become pregnant, and Arianna gets pregnant as well.  You also find a cord from defeating Mergo’s Wet Nurse.  <em>To me, this implies that on the Red Moon, Oedon impregnates all able-bodied women not protected by incense or inside.  Because the Great Ones always lose a child on the Red Moon (though the reason is not necessarily stated), it seems to be that the Great Ones impregnate women to have surrogate children.</em></p>

<p>However, this reveals another truth about the game that previously eluded me:  the other cord you find is in the Workshop, very near the doll.</p>

<p><em>The remainder of this is 100% Conjecture.  It’s based on some items and theories, but it’s nothing more than me trying to make sense of things.</em></p>

<p>The Hunter’s Dream</p>

<p>This is pure conjecture, but here’s my thought on the meaning:  Because it mentions that there was a mad obsession in the doll’s creation, I think on the first Red Moon Gherman’s wife became pregnant with the squid thing seen in the true ending.  Upon its birth, Gherman killed the child; his wife likely died in childbirth.  Deciding that something needed to be done, he donned the mantle of the hunter and slew beasts.  In his spare time, he reconstructed his wife in the form of a doll, which he meticulously designed to be perfect.  The hair comb was a memento of his wife that he still kept.</p>

<p>He became manic, and was possibly confronted by the Moon Presence, which potentially killed him or forced him into the roll he is in now.  Eileen’s people believe that the Hunter’s Dream is an afterlife.  If so, and my other assumption is true, it would make sense that the Hunter’s Dream would be the Workshop he used so often, why the doll is alive, and why he appears to tell you to go search the chalices and hunt beasts (and why you would first go there upon dying).  Eventually, after you’ve slain so many, killed the nightmares, and slain the Great Ones, there is nothing left for you in the Hunter’s Dream, so Gherman burns down the Workshop.  He offers you the service of killing you, that you may wake up from this dream, be born again, and return to Yharnam in the day.  Yes, the city is probably still awful, but the beasts and Great Ones are presumably now killed, and it’s not your concern anymore.</p>

<p>However, should you refuse, Gherman wishes you only accept your fate and strives to kill you.  However, by killing him, you bring back the Moon Presence, which then kills you.  You awaken in your own dream, so tinged by Gherman’s vision that it’s all you have left, and you are now the caretaker; thus, the hunt begins anew.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you’ve consumed the umbilical cord (each item is only 1/3rd of it) and gained the insight necessary to see the world as it truly is, the Moon Presence cannot consume you as you have ascended and seen the Truth of the Great Ones.  So empowered, you fight and kill him, succeeding and leaving the dream forever.  All that’s left in the dream are the final memories of Gherman, who remembers his strange, squid-like child, which the doll (his wife) picks up, coddles, and says “oh, good hunter” in a shocked/thankful tone, as though you’re returning her child to her.</p>

<p>Alternate Theory</p>

<p>It’s equally possible that Gherman used the umbilical cord to contact the Moon Presence to gain power, which trapped him within the Dream.  However, I still think the Dream is an afterlife.  I genuinely think that Gherman’s wife gave birth to a monster, and he killed it and harvested the umbilical cord.  I don’t think he used it, because he didn’t consume it (since it’s still there), and I think the reason the doll seems to so affectionately grab the squid is because it’s actually his wife’s child, and the doll is modeled after her.</p>

<p>Your Part in All This</p>

<p>I think after you receive blood ministration, you become infected with beasthood, which is most obviously seen when you grow a claw during a visceral attack.  Once you die, you arrive in the Hunter’s Dream because the Moon Presence is sending hunters there constantly, trapping them within it.  The citizens are already infected, and far enough gone that they blame and attack all outsiders.  Your ability to gain insight into how the world truly works shows that you’re obviously ascending; the fact that the umbilical cords give you insight is proof of that.  You may not be becoming a beast; you may be undergoing metamorphosis like the scholars tried to do.  Regardless, you’re trapped within a dream, and you only have three options:  let Gherman kill you and truly wake you up (taking away your ability to have Insight and seeing the regular world), kill Gherman (in which case the Moon Presence forces you to take his place), or kill the Moon Presence (at which point you ascend and the child that started Gherman’s hunt in the first place is returned to his “mother.”)  Is that last bit why I think Gherman did his hunt for revenge.</p>

<p>So what do you all think?  Did you learn some things?  Am I completely wrong about everything?  Let me know!</p>

<p>EDIT: So it was just pointed out that in the real ending, the trophy says you yourself become an infant Great One. So... I guess toss the theory it being Gherman&#39;s son out the window. In that case, I&#39;d be willing to go with the idea that Gherman managed to acquire a cord and used it to gain a pact with the Moon Presence, and was captivated by the moon and vowed to watch over the Dream, like the trophy says.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  There seems to be evidence suggesting that Willem tried to &quot;mind meld&quot; with Rom like Mensis did with Mergo. So that could be a thing.</p>

<p>EDIT 3:  I changed the spelling of Amygdala and Yharnam, as some people have pointed out.</p>

<p>EDIT 4:  Freakindon pointed out what I feel are incredibly good points, and severely change the way the ending plays out:</p>

<p>&quot;My thoughts are that the Moon Presence is Kos/Kosm (the guy that Micolash pleads to for eyes), which is kind of a king of the Great Ones. The hunter&#39;s dream is a nightmare fueled by experimentation with using an umbilical cord as a weapon. At that point, Kosm slew Gehrman and forced him to be a host of the nightmare. Hunters are bound to the nightmare and forced to purge the corruption, for the sole purpose of acquiring blood echoes (which contains the power of the Great Ones). When Gehrman executes you, the blood echoes are transferred to Kosm to extend his power. If you kill Gehrman, the nightmare starts waning, so Kosm comes down to personally take the echoes and then make you a host of the nightmare. If you have the umbilical cords consumed, you have acquired too much power for him to simply take it from you. When you beat him, you dispel the nightmare and are reborn as a Great One, after obtaining his echoes (note that you get upwards of 200,000 echoes for beating him).</p>

<p>Also Rom was not a Great One initially. Micolash states that he wants eyes like Kosm gave to Rom, suggesting that Rom was probably a church member who attained the status of Great One.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT 5:  BloodyBurney points out the following points of lore:</p>

<p>&quot;A couple things.</p>

<p>The School of Mensis and the Choir are the two highest parts of the Healing Church.</p>

<p>The Healing Church was founded by members of Bergenwerth to study the old blood, which is most likely the medium that was found.</p>

<p>Willem was the one who would have been proud. Not Gehrman.</p>

<p>The bells were found in the old labyrinth and the Bell Maidens are said to be mad Pthumerians.</p>

<p>Gherman hunted even before the Church&#39;s existence.</p>

<p>Mergo was the child and is implied to be something much darker.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT 6:  Gherman being proud of Caryll was a mistake.  It&#39;s been changed to Willem.</p>

<p>EDIT 7:  Many posters have mentioned that there&#39;s a good chance that Willem, Laurence, and Gherman knew each other.</p>

<p>EDIT 8:  Several people have pointed out that the Great Ones have pale blood, with the notable exception of Amygdala and Rom.  This is interesting for a few reasons:
1.  It implies that seeking paleblood is indeed the answer to ascension, because infusing ourselves with it makes us become Great Ones ourselves.
2.  If the above point in EDIT 4 about Rom being made into a Great One is true, that would be the reason he has red blood.  It would imply he&#39;s not a &quot;true&quot; Great One.
3.  Most interestingly, if Amygdala is in fact not a &quot;true&quot; Great One due to her red blood, it would explain a few things.  First, why she so intensely grabbed the attention of Yahar&#39;ghul and perhaps wrenched their worship away from the Great Ones (perhaps trying to steal attention).  This could also be why she appears to be taking an interest in the Healing Church (see:  Vicar Amelia) and Oedon&#39;s Cathedral; if her goal is to pass as a Great One and steal worship and blood echoes, possibly to become a true Great One.</p>

<h2>The Hunter's Guide to Beasts and Kin: Part 1</h2>

<button onclick="toggles('30wu49')">View full post</button>
<div id="30wu49" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong><em>--Wondrous Introductions--</em></strong></p>

<p>Having just finished my first NG+ playthrough, I&#39;ve decided to stop lurking around and actually contribute something. Over the next week or so I&#39;m going to be spending most of my time helping random players with bosses and writing while I wait to be Beckoned. Hopefully players old and new alike can learn a thing or two from this guide, I certainly have had fun putting it all together!</p>

<p>Part 1 of this guide will be a broad overview of who/what the Beasts and the Kin are, how they can be identified, and why understanding enemy type is more important than you&#39;d think. <strong>Because this is something that&#39;s worth understanding from the get go, this first part will be completely spoiler free as much as humanly possible.</strong> <em>With that being said</em>, it&#39;ll be impossible to talk about the Kin without giving away some of the surprise of encountering them for the first time. Either way, I won&#39;t be naming any specific areas, bosses, weapons, or rare items. </p>

<p>Future posts will go much, more in depth about the most effective weapons/gem combinations/attire for killing these enemy types, specific Beast and Kin bosses and how to effectively use their weaknesses, and the lore behind these two fascinating groups. I&#39;d love to answer any unclear questions in the comments or via message! Thanks for reading, and may the good blood guide your way.</p>

<p><strong>(Guide starts hear if you don&#39;t care about that intro nonsense)</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>--Part 1: Reeks of Monsters--</em></strong></p>

<p>Although it&#39;s never explicitly explained (like so many other systems within Bloodborne), all enemies and bosses within the game are classified as one of three types. <strong>The three classes are Beast, Kin, or what I&#39;ll refer to as Neutral.</strong> It&#39;s very possible to beat the game without ever knowing these classifications exist, but you&#39;ll be missing out on a lot of interesting strategies and decision making. Also on a super basic level, the damage to Beasts/Kin blood gems are extremely powerful while simultaneously being extremely misunderstood. Luckily for you, you soon will understand these things!</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> The first of these groups consists of all people and creatures that have succumbed to the <strong>Scourge of the Beast</strong>, the mysterious plague devastating the town of Yharnam. To clarify what this means, Special Attack is defined as the poison on your weapon and the &quot;extent that ATK is raised vs kin <em>and severely transformed beasts</em>.&quot; This means that even though the<a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Hunter+Mob"> angry Yharnam villagers</a> are all technically infected, only the &quot;severely transformed&quot; count as Beasts.</p>

<p>Physically, beasts are generally characterized by long <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Tainted+Dog">fur</a> or <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Carrion+Crow">feathers</a>, drastically <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Boar">increased size</a>, and long claws. Basically if it&#39;s an animal or human that&#39;s been clearly deformed in some way physically it&#39;s a Beast for sure. In combat, Beasts are typically fast and are the most likely to sprint or jump at your character upon gaining vision (although enemies of all three types can do this). Beasts are generally also &quot;dumb&quot; compared to other enemies and usually have straightforward attack patterns. There are a few <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Scurrying+Beast">unique cases</a> though.</p>

<p>The majority of the early bosses also share these traits and in many cases we&#39;re explicitly told they are Beasts. <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleric+Beast">Jumpy Bridge Buddy</a>, <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Blood-starved+Beast">Hungry Dude</a>, <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Darkbeast+Paarl">Dr. Pearl</a>, and even our beloved <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Father+Gascoigne">Father Guacamole</a> are classified as Beasts for obvious reasons. </p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> As you move farther into the game you&#39;ll begin to encounter enemies that are less and less grounded in reality. Many people in this sub have aptly described <strong>The Kin of the Cosmos</strong> as creatures of true Lovecraftian horror, and this is a good way of thinking about them, at least as far as appearances go. The Kin are definitely identifiable because of this.</p>

<p>After killing <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Rom%2C+the+Vacuous+Spider">Rob the Vacuum Liar</a> you&#39;ll receive an <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Kin+Coldblood">item</a> that was previously possessed by the &quot;inhuman kin of the cosmos,
brethren of the Great Ones.&quot; These three things clearly separate the Kin from other enemies. If they&#39;re human, they look like something that could exist on earth, or they don&#39;t resemble the <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Ones">Great Ones</a> in any way, they&#39;re almost certainly not Kin. (I don&#39;t want to go into too much more detail for the sake of spoilers)</p>

<p>The vast majority of enemies in most of the final areas, including multiple optional areas, are Kin. The bosses within these areas are also prone to the same weaknesses.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> And then there&#39;s pretty much just whatever&#39;s leftover. If it doesn&#39;t look even remotely werewolf or like <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Host">a grotesque alien monster</a>, it&#39;s probably just <strong>a boring old Neutral enemy</strong>. Not too much to say here. Sometimes it&#39;s really obvious <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+Giant">they don&#39;t fit nicely into either category</a>, <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Stalker">sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell</a>, and sometimes it just <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Viper+Pit">seems ridiculous</a> for them to be neither. Multiple areas in the game, both <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Forbidden+Woods">required areas</a> and <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Cainhurst+Castle">optional areas</a>, contain a majority of Neutrals, so that can make it easier to tell in some cases.</p>

<p><strong><em>--Basics Everyone Should Know--</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Beasts take increased damage from fire</strong> and are also<a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Hunter%27s+Torch"> scared of fire</a> in many cases. When hunting in an area filled with Beasts, don&#39;t be afraid to use <a href="http://bloodborne.wikia.com/wiki/Molotov_Cocktail">items</a>, even if <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Fire+Paper">they seem rare</a>. You&#39;ll encounter less and less Beasts as the game progresses, so these items are most valuable right around when you get them. You&#39;re more than welcome to struggle through some of the early bosses holding onto these items, but late game they&#39;re really just not as useful. Also be on the lookout for campfires. Enemies will take damage if they walk over fire, especially Beasts.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> On the flip side, <strong>Kin take increased damage from bolt.</strong> Although there are <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Bolt+Paper">items</a> that can help with this, it&#39;s advisable to make a point of getting a <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Tonitrus">bolt weapon</a> or seeking out a blood gem that gives a weapon bolt damage. Some of the late game bosses can be breezed through with the proper weapon.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Neutral enemies do not have universal weaknesses or resistances.</strong> Not too much to say here. Some are weak to fire, some are strong to fire, etc. We&#39;re still trying to figure out exactly what each Neutral is strong and weak to. Work in progress!</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> <strong>Blood gems that give increased damage against Beasts or Kin are fantastic in general</strong> and should almost always be taken when you know you&#39;re up against one or the other, especially in the case of boss fight. I&#39;ll get into the math in future posts, but on physical damage weapons it&#39;s virtually always stronger to take the increased damage against a type instead of additional physical damage. The Beast/Kin damage gems are typically NOT better than gems that give increased fire/bolt damage if you have decent arcane. Beast/Kin damage gems are also often more valuable on <a href="http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Tonitrus">lower durability weapons</a> since the bonus damage does not decrease as much as weapons are used.</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> <strong>Arcane is absolutely incredible against Beast/Kin once you have weapons to take advantage of it</strong>. Although Strength and Skill definitely are more useful early on for damage, if you ignore Arcane entirely some fights will be rough. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people dismiss Arcane builds as cheesy, and yeah, building Arcane right from the get go is silly, but it&#39;s extremely potent later into the game.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading! Again, I&#39;d love to answer questions in the comments or get feedback on this first part.</em></p>

<p>EDIT 1: A lot of people have been asking for a comprehensive list of enemy types, which is something that doesn&#39;t seem to exist yet... So that means I&#39;m going to run around all of the game and hit every enemy with three Threaded Canes and test for type. Every single enemy. I won&#39;t be answering questions on here for a while but if anyone wants to ask me something or enjoy this task along with me, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/brodrian1231">I&#39;ll be streaming these adventures for a while over the next couple days</a>. Thanks for the support guys.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I know this is mega generic and cheesy but I&#39;ve never been gilded before, nor have I ever gotten something to the front page. You&#39;re all the best.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: Does the Saw Cleaver really do 20% bonus damage to Beasts? <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/310pvo/saw_cleaver_mythbusters_does_it_really_do_bonus/">The answer is pretty interesting!</a></p>

<p>I have not tested this a ton but it seems that if I die somewhere in the game and lose my echoes, all I have to do is zone into the Lecture Hall 1st floor and they are on the ground waiting for me.  Its happened 4 or 5 times so far.  I was farming the blobs in the class room for quick levels for certain bosses, so I would go fight a boss and if I got destroyed, head to the Lecture Hall and each time a puddle of my lost echoes would be right there waiting for me.</p>

<p>Just a heads up in case you are at that point in the game and accidentally lose a ton of echoes. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some of these are extrapolation based on my experiences and may not be exact.  If you have better information let me know.  The order of events merely reflect what you can do in terms of sidequests before it becomes necessary to advance the plot, I don&#39;t recommend necessarily doing things in this order.  Events which advance the plot are marked in <strong>bold</strong>, optional events in <em>italics</em>.</p>

<p>Edit: At some point I&#39;ll probably reformat the information, I don&#39;t like the way it looks now.</p>

<p><strong>Main Game</strong></p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Iosefka locks the door to the 2nd Floor Clinic, where you started the game</li>
<li>Iosefka offers you an Iosefka&#39;s Blood Vial if you talk to her (she&#39;ll give you as many as you want if you return to the Hunter&#39;s Dream and come back, but you can only carry a maximum of 1)</li>
</ul>

<li>Can talk Viola&#39;s younger daughter for the Music Box after climbing up two long ladders out of around the middle of the sewers area where all of the legless enemies pretending to be dead corpses are chilling; look for the window with burning incense and listen for the sound of a wind-up music box</li>

<li>Eileen leaves her location in Central Yharnam</li>
<li>Iosefka no longer offers you an Iosefka&#39;s Blood Vial <a href="#spoiler">because she&#39;s killed by a member of the choir who impersonates her from here on</a></li>
<li>Can talk to Iosefka and offer to send people to her clinic; <a href="#spoiler">she&#39;s actually an imposter from the Choir who just murdered the real Iosefka and who kills whomever you send in exchange for items, usually 2 numbing mists</a></li>
<li>Can give Viola&#39;s younger daughter the Red Jeweled Brooch for some lore, or use it for a Red Blood Gem (Phys ATK +2.7%, Rally +1.8%)</li>
<li>Can send Viola&#39;s younger daughter to a safe haven if you don&#39;t give her the Brooch, <a href="#spoiler">the pig in the sewers eats her if you send her to the chapel or give her the brooch; kill it for a Red Messenger Ribbon</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enter the Cathedral Ward</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Can find a Monocular on a corpse near the Hunter Chief gate; it&#39;s sitting on a balcony-like area where the Cleric Beast jumps down from</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Open the large Gate locked by the Hunter Chief Emblem</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Eileen spawns near the Cathedral Ward bonfire, just outside the building (go out the middle door and hook a left immediately), can learn her Shh! gesture.  You must meet her either here or in the Central Yharnam Dry Dock area to progress her quest.  You can open the gate either way you choose, using the Emblem or via the lever on the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Open all three gates in the Cathedral Ward</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Henyrk spawns at tomb of Oeden (if you&#39;ve spoken to Eileen at either of her two previous locations) and the lamp there is disabled.  He may leave at some point in the future, possibly as late as Rom.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Defeat Three Bosses Total</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Easiest way is to take on Cleric Beast, Father Gascoigne, and either Blood-starved Beast or (if you have the Hunter Chief Emblem) the Witch of Hemwick should be easier.</li>
<li>Can now send Arianna to a safe haven, can learn the Curtsy gesture if she arrives safely; she&#39;s located on the near left side of the large plaza you open with the Hunter Chief&#39;s Badge (or, follow the stairs down from the Vicar Amelia  boss to reach the plaza from the opposite side, it will be far right instead of near left).  She&#39;ll give you a blood transfusion which acts like a Blood Vial but also hastens stamina regen for a time; you can only carry one of these special transfusions at a time, even if they&#39;re from different characters.</li>
<li>Can send the Skeptical Man near Arianna to a safe haven <a href="#spoiler">he goes to the opposite of whichever you suggest</a>; he&#39;ll reluctantly offer you &quot;tips&quot; as the game progresses, but he&#39;s completely wrong about everything</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Meet Henryk in Tomb of Oeden</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#spoiler">He attacks you as you approach</a></li>
<li>Eileen leaves her spot near the Cathedral Ward bonfire (and you miss out on the Shh! gesture if you haven&#39;t gotten it from her yet) <a href="#spoiler">and aids you in your fight against Henryk</a>; speak to her for the Approval gesture.  You must meet her once before (either in the Sewers or the Cathedral Ward) then keep her alive in the <a href="#spoiler">fight against Henryk</a> to advance her quest.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter Old Yharnam from the Front Gate</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Retired Hunter Djura is hostile; don&#39;t kill him if you want his gesture, but if you do you get his Powder Keg Badge and his clothes will appear at the Insight Shop.</li>
<li>At the very top of the church-like structure is a rope tied to the railing.  Break it and it will light the crucified Blood-starved Beast in the center of the church on fire, killing many of the enemies below; but be warned that doing so kills them every time you zone into the area, which prevents you from befriending Djura.</li>
<li>Can summon Alfred if you agreed to work together with him and stand near a tutorial message that asks you to ring the Beckoning Bell</li>
<li>Leads to the Blood-Starved Beast Boss</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Defeat the Blood-Starved Beast</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Drops the Pthumeru Chalice</li>
<li>Sack-wielding kidnappers spawn; getting killed by them takes you to a prison (see below)</li>
<li>Right side door in Chapel Ward is unlocked, leading into the Healing Church Workshop</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter the Healing Church Workshop</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Make your way to the very bottom of the tower to find a path leading to the Grand Cathedral, the area past the large gate locked by the Hunter Chief emblem; you can fight the Vicar Amelia Boss without needing the Hunter Chief Emblem this way.</li>
<li>Make your way about halfway down to find a slightly hidden path to the Abandoned Workshop</li>
<li>Make your way to the top to find the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge and a locked door leading into the Upper Cathedral Ward</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter the Abandoned Workshop</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Can pick up a 1/3rd Umbilical Cord</li>
<li>Can pick up Doll&#39;s Clothes</li>
<li>Can pick up Small Hair Ornament (give it to the Doll for some minor lore and a Tear Stone, which can be used to grant you a Health Regeneration +2 Blood Gem).</li>
<li>Can find the Old Hunter Bone spell</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Get Killed by Sack-wielding Kidnapper</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Get taken to Hypogean Gaol prison</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter Hypogean Gaol</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Can send Adella the Nun to a safe house by speaking to her with any Church Attire chest piece equipped (Black Church, White Church, Father Gascoigne, Tomb Prospector, Yahar&#39;gul Black, Executioner, or Choir; in short, anything listed under the Church Attire heading of the storage bin, if you forget) gain the Church Bow (Female) gesture if she arrives safely.  She&#39;ll offer you a special blood transfusion that acts as a Blood Vial but also provides rapid health regeneration for some time afterward, but you can only carry one of these transfusions at a time, even if they&#39;re from different characters.</li>
<li>Note that if you accept blood from Arianna in Adella&#39;s presence three times, <a href="#spoiler">Adella will kill Arianna on the next load in out of jealousy, so you miss out on the 1/3rd umbilical cord you get from Arianna later</a></li>
<li>Leads to the Darkbeast Paarl Boss</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter the Darkbeast Paarl boss room</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Retired Hunter Djura is flagged as friendly, though this is likely a bug and it&#39;s intended for you to defeat the boss first.  If you want to speak to him before beating the boss, warp to the Church of the Good Chalice (Blood-starved Beast) lamp and make your way to him without entering the area in front of his Gatling gun to speak to him.  Alternately, if you have the shortcuts open, you can go to him from the Old Yharnam lamp, just avoid crossing in front of him.  See the section immediately below for what that meeting entails.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Defeat the Darkbeast Paarl Boss</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Drops the Spark Hunter Badge</li>
<li>You can enter Old Yharnam through the area past the boss to speak to Retired Hunter Djura.  Accept his proposal for the Brush Off Dust gesture and his Powder Keg Badge; don&#39;t attack him or walk to the area in front of his gatling gun or he becomes hostile.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Enter the Forbidden Forest</strong></p>

There is an NPC in the forest for you to talk to and receive the stone from, if you want.</li>
<li>In the area with the dog cages there&#39;s a passage way which leads into a cave, which leads all the way into the back door of Iosefka&#39;s clinic.</li>
<li>Can loot the Beastial Roar spell off a corpse in a decrepit building near the dog cages</li>
<li>Can speak to and send the Hobo (located off a slightly hidden drop inside the Windmill) to a safe haven <a href="#spoiler">he slowly kills everyone at the chapel over time as he is a cannibalistic werewolf, or dies to Iosefka for 2 beast blood pellets; drops a Beast rune if killed either by you or Iosefka, but if you take him on yourself be prepared for a tough fight</a></li>
<li>Leads to the Shadow of Yharnam Boss</li>
</ul>

<li>Easiest way is to take on Cleric Beast, Father Gascoigne, Blood-starved Beast, Witch of Hemwick, Vicar Amelia, Darkbeast Paarl, and the Shadow of Yharnam bosses</li>
<li>The Old Lady goes senile and now offers you Sedatives if you talk to her, <a href="#spoiler">she&#39;ll die at some point in the future if you ask for too many in a row and she has to leave to get more, though I&#39;m not exactly sure what triggers it; it appears to be 7 sedatives, total</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enter Iosefka&#39;s Clinic</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Iosefka will have moved up to the 3rd floor <a href="#spoiler">and will warn you not to approach her.  If you anger her, she will attack and you can no longer send any NPCs to her.</a></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Enter The Nightmare</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Leads to the Micolash: Host of the Nightmare Boss</li>
<li>Can find the Iron Door Key in the boss fight room; it&#39;s in the basement of the second area you fight it in.  It can be used to unlock the door in the very first room of the boss fight, but it&#39;s better to take the path mentioned below.</li>
<li>Can jump off the second cage elevator (the one with the broken door) mid-transit and into a window; make your way past everything to a lever and pull it to dump the eyeball creature into the abyss; loot the Choir Bell spell out of a chest soon after near a patrolling Brain Trust, drop into the area where the eyeball creature was to find the one and only Blood Rock outside of Chalice Dungeons, then make your way all the way to the other side of door mentioned above and exit back into the boss room.</li>

<ul>
<li>Accept the offer of the NPC <a href="#spoiler">Gehrman</a> in the Hunter&#39;s Dream to avoid a fight and receive the first ending.</li>
