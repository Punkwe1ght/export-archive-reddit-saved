<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>i. let this moment be the first chapter</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve somehow gone the last eight years without hearing about <em>Hamilton: an American Musical,</em> then you either live under a rock or you’re so far removed from the world of musical theater that the gap can be measured in light years. But just in case you have no idea what I’m talking about, here’s a quick summary.</p>

<p>In 2015, playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda (also the guy behind <em>Encanto</em>, so blame him for the amount of time you’ve spent listening to “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”) released a play he’d been working on for seven years, and it immediately became a smash hit. After completely selling out on Off-Broadway, it transferred over to Broadway in August of 2015, and went on to win 11 awards, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical">Best Musical</a> at the Tony Awards, as well as a Pulitzer Prize in 2016.</p>

<p><em>Hamilton</em> tells the (somewhat fictionalized) story of founding father Alexander Hamilton, who served under George Washington during the Revolution, wrote most of <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, was the first Treasury Secretary, and created the national bank. Inspired by the biography <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_(book"><em>Alexander Hamilton</em></a>) by Ron Chernow, Miranda used rap, R&amp;B, pop, and hip-hop in brilliant concert, and somehow managed to make a coherent rap musical about a founding father. Which, yeah, that’s pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Now, <em>Hamilton</em> has received its fair share of criticism. When it premiered on Disney+ (yes, Disney owns <em>Hamilton</em> — that is, the filmed version of it) fans pointed out that it <a href="https://thejasminebrand.com/2020/07/06/musical-hamilton-receives-backlash-accused-of-romanticizing-alexander-hamilton-downplaying-him-trading-slaves-sparks-cancelhamilton/">romanticized the founding fathers</a> (especially their role in slavery). Its fandom also tends to be a little on the unhinged side, in part due to its nature as borderline-RPF (real-person fiction). However, most people accept that for all of its flaws, <em>Hamilton</em> is a fun and catchy way to learn about an obscure founding father.</p>

<p><strong>ii. laurens, i like you a lot</strong></p>

<p>I can’t really talk about the <em>Hamilton</em> fandom without mentioning Lams — this will make more sense later, don’t worry. The most popular ship (”ship” being a term for a romantic relationship between two characters) in the fandom, Lams is the pairing of John Laurens/Alexander Hamilton. Now, the fact that it’s M/M isn’t surprising, since M/M is usually the most popular shipping category in any fandom. We love the gays. What’s interesting about Lams in particular is that it‘s <em>actually canon</em>, and was included in the musical itself. While we can’t prove for sure that Hamilton and Laurens were lovers, there’s a <a href="http://nymsdiary.blogspot.com/2019/01/top-10-romantic-excerpts-of-letters.html">lot</a> of evidence for the theory.</p>

<p>Without going too in-depth, Hamilton wrote some…uh, suspicious letters to Laurens, which included jokes about his <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-02-02-0100">penis size</a> and the like. Nothing too incriminating, until you realize that Hamilton also <em>invited Laurens to witness and participate in his wedding night.</em> Yes, the consummation of his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler. He basically invited Laurens to a threesome — and stressed that Elizabeth only liked Laurens as a friend. Which is pretty gay, no matter how you think about it.</p>

<p>Anyways, this relationship was hinted at in the musical, and Miranda explicitly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_media_portrayals_of_bisexuality#Theatre">confirmed</a> that his version of Hamilton (as well as writing the musical, he was the actor for Hamilton with the original cast) is bisexual. You’d think this musical would be the wrong one for a church to rip off and then turn homophobic, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p><strong>iii. whaaaaaat</strong></p>

<p>In August of 2022, the Door McAllen church produced and live-streamed their production of <em>Hamilton</em>. You can find the whole thing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyuO2Rh-b8AhVZAjQIHd7SDq0QwqsBegQICBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp0epuHf_gP8&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Yur_q6cenUm_G3q-hGhBO">here</a>, and let me tell you, it’s an absolute disaster. When I watched it, I physically had to pause after every song and just. Wonder what the hell I was watching. If you don’t want to watch the full thing, here’s a rundown of all the weird and wild stuff that happens.</p>

<p>—The church changed some of the lines. For example, Angelica says, “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wildandtired/video/7132121828570533126?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7106715388207547950">Jesus gives me the strength to pull through / When I needed him most, he was right on time</a>” instead of “She is buried in Trinity Church near you / When I needed her most, she was right on time”).</p>

<p>—The singing is just really, really bad. “The Schuyler Sisters” is probably the best example of this.</p>

<p>—They left out entire songs. What happened to “The Ten Duel Commandments”? Who knows.</p>

<p>—They added an entire scene in which Hamilton coverts to Christianity.</p>

<p>—The homophobic speech.</p>

<p>Wait, what? What homophobic speech? Okay, technically this wasn’t in the musical itself. But they added a sermon to the performance which <a href="https://twitter.com/hemantmehta/status/1556402522918719488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1556402522918719488%7Ctwgr%5Edd527e8a8dafd4125eec61e0d5e07ce0f49b1329%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnation%2F2022%2F08%2F08%2Fhamilton-texas-church-gay-addiction-edited-scenes%2F">likened homosexuality to drug addiction, alcoholism, and financial struggle</a>. Now, as I mentioned before, <em>Hamilton</em> isn’t exactly homophobic. The main character is literally portrayed as bisexual. He’s implied to be in a relationship with another man. Of all the musicals to turn homophobic, this is <em>not</em> the one.</p>

<p>The <em>Hamilton</em> crew was understandably pissed off that not only was their musical ripped off, but it was homophobic. They made a public statement condemning the homophobia, saying that “The Hamilton family stands for tolerance, compassion, inclusivity and certainly LGBTQ+ rights.” Doesn’t get much more gay-friendly than that. Check and mate, psycho church.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more. You thought it was just a bad musical? Nope, turns out it was also <a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1557369846396080128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1557369846396080128%7Ctwgr%5Ea5bb030c0ecfdb3dff3db82f14407ce3273742d4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2022%2F08%2Fscamilton-texas-church-fined-unlicensed-hamilton-tik-tok.html">illegal</a>. Turns out the church had lied about getting approval from Miranda to stage the production, but had actually been told not to go through with the production. The church ended up having to <em>pay</em> Miranda and the team behind the musical for damages. The problem wasn’t that they used copyrighted music, but rather that they livestreamed the entire thing and put it on the internet.</p>

<p>And the crippling irony of it all, even more so than the whole homophobic musical about a bi dude thing? Hamilton wasn’t even Christian*.</p>

<p><strong>iv. what is a legacy?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the Door McAllen church had to pay the <em>Hamilton</em> team a fine. The <em>Hamilton</em> team, in an extraordinary ”fuck you”, turned around and donated all the money to the <a href="https://www.steprgv.com/">South Texas Equality Project</a>, a pro-LGBTQ+ organization that works in the same area as the church itself. The church also made the following statement: “The Door Christian Fellowship McAllen Church did not ask for, or receive, a license from the producers or creators of <em>Hamilton</em> to produce, stage, replicate, or alter any part of <em>Hamilton.</em> Nor did we seek prior permission to alter Lin-Manuel Miranda’s work by changing the music, the lyrics, deleting songs, and adding dialogue.” It also called the whole situation a “learning opportunity”, which, uh. Yeah. The statement ignores the homophobia situation entirely.</p>

<p>While the church was told to take down all of their videos of the production, by this point TikTok had gotten its hands on the drama, and there was no going back. The church’s reputation? In tatters. The <em>Hamilton</em> musical? As popular as ever.</p>

<p>And there you have it. The story of how a church in Texas illegally turned <em>Hamilton</em> into religious propaganda.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>*Edit — according to the Chernow biography, “[He] was not clearly affiliated with the denomination and did not seem to attend church regularly or take communion. Like Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson, Hamilton had probably fallen under the sway of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism">deism</a>, which sought to substitute reason for revelation and dropped the notion of an active God who intervened in human affairs. At the same time, he never doubted God&#39;s existence, embracing Christianity as a system of morality and cosmic justice.” In school I had learned Hamilton was a deist, but most sources agree that he became more religious in his later life. (While he did insult Jefferson by calling him an “atheist“, we have no way of knowing whether or not this was a utilitarian political move or an actual belief. Probably a bit of both.)</p>

<p>Anyways, to clarify, Hamilton was certainly religious, but probably not explicitly Christian the way we label it. He was a man of faith, but I couldn’t find any evidence for him believing in Jesus and the resurrection. If anyone can find evidence, let me know in the comments!</p>

<h2>[Formula 1] Ayrton Senna: Unforgettable moments of the man that forever changed the history of car racing in Brazil</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Prestigious_Chip_895 </span><span class = "numcomments">31 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/10jmm76/formula_1_ayrton_senna_unforgettable_moments_of/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(272)">View full post</button><div id="272" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today I decided to remember the story of a rice driver who marked the history of Brazil, <a href="https://epipoca.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ayrton-senna-1-1200x900.jpg">Ayrton Senna</a>. I&#39;m sure his name is recognized by many people around the world, but I don&#39;t know how much his story is known to people outside of Brazil. So if you don&#39;t know much about him and barely recognize the name, I&#39;ll start the write-up with a spoiler: the whole text is leading to the tragic moment of his death, during a race, at the age of 34, in 1994.</p>

<p>To show you the weight that his story has in the country, I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about my experience with Senna. I was born years after his death, and yet, I remember tributes paid to him during school festivities, I get emotional when I hear the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0hmmX96QvY"> victory song</a>, and I definitely cried several times doing research for this text. Senna&#39;s story is common knowledge, even for those who were only born years after the tragedy and don&#39;t like racing. Pelé was the most known Brazilian athlete worldwide, and even so, there are Brazilians who claim that he was not the greatest Brazilian football player. But Senna is a unanimity, and I still haven&#39;t found a person who says something different from “he was the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time”.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID HE BECOME A FORMULA 1 DRIVER</strong></p>

<p>On March 21, 1960, Senna was born in São Paulo. At the age of four, he was already passionate about karting and showing skills, and 9 year old him was already driving jeeps. At the age of 13, he was competing professionally with the kart. He arrived in Europe in 1981, at 21, and three years later he had attracted the attention of several teams and entered Formula 1. (An important addendum is that Senna had a time in those three years when he even gave up racing, as he could not get sponsorships and did not want his parents to continue paying for him to race. However, after returning to Brazil, he was so unhappy, that his family, despite their reservations, encouraged him to return to Europe and continue racing).</p>

<p>My intention here is not to speak in detail about his victories and races, but it is to show iconic moments of him that are forever in popular memory. <a href="https://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/en/piloto/">His website</a> has text in English and details his trajectory in the sport, in addition to presenting his statistics, showing what an amazing driver he was.</p>

<p>His parents, in numerous interviews, still by their son&#39;s side years before the accident, showed dissatisfaction with the path chosen by him. They didn&#39;t want Senna to run for Formula 1, due to fear related to the safety of the sport, or rather, the lack of safety. Here is a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ru9p2t/formula_1_the_quick_and_the_dead_the_history_of/"> great write-up</a> posted by another Redditor, which explains in detail the safety issues in Formula 1 at that time, its advances over the years, how Senna&#39;s death was received by the industry, and the consequences triggered by the accident.</p>

<p><strong>SENNA&#39;S VICTORY LAP</strong></p>

<p>I briefly mentioned Senna&#39;s victory song, which is actually not his but ended up being forever linked to his image.</p>

<p>Basically, Rede Globo, which broadcasted Formula 1, in Brazil, exclusively (in 2021, after 40 years, they didn&#39;t renew the transmission contract), began in 1983 to use the song “Tema da Vitória” to accompany all victories in Formula 1. From 1986, the music began to be used for Brazilian victories. Since Senna was running during that period, his victories were accompanied by this song, and in popular memory, his image will always be linked to it. However, it&#39;s not just the music that shapes his iconic image, but it&#39;s the music accompanied by the Brazilian flag. </p>

<p>In 1986 Brazil had just been eliminated in the quarterfinals of the World Cup by France on penalty kicks. The day after the loss, Senna had an exciting race in Detroit, and two of his biggest opponents in that race were French racers. And despite the difficulties, Senna managed to finish in first place. And then he created one of the most classic moments of his career, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6f3VPCjwaM">drove by someone with a Brazilian flag and asked for it</a> (2:09s), and then he continued a lap in the car while holding the flag. </p>

<p>He would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYpT2bg4zp8">repeat this habit several times</a> (1:34s – I have to be honest, I cried just a little bit watching this video, and can&#39;t even imagine how it was to the people that were watching there). This accompanied by the song, it&#39;s something that I immediately think of when talking about Senna, even if I haven&#39;t seen any of these moments firsthand.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST WORLDWIDE VICTORY</strong></p>

<p>In 1988, in Japan, Ayrton Senna won his first world title. It&#39;s an exciting race, in which he started 14th and finished first. In the documentary Senna (which I recommend you watch, it also has English subtitles available), one of the commentators states that for those who watched the race, Senna&#39;s position at the start was as if the dream had come to an end, but he managed to win. </p>

<p>Who started the race very well and was in second place on the podium was the also incredible racer, teammate, and at the time also a rival of Senna, Alain Prost. I&#39;m not going to delve into their relationship, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omOPU-ejZEg">this video</a> sums it up well, using footage of them at the time.</p>

<p>In 1993, the year before Senna&#39;s death, their public field came to an end. In Prost&#39;s last race, in Australia, after taking first place, Senna pulled the racer, who was in second position, to join him on the podium in first place, in honor of the athlete&#39;s career. Also in the recommended video, it is possible to see this moment and hear Prost declaring that after that they created a friendship, ending the rivalry of years between them.</p>

<p><strong>THE HISTORIC VICTORY IN BRAZIL</strong></p>

<p>In 1991, for the first time in his history, Senna won a race in Brazil. For some reason, every time he raced at home something went wrong, and he couldn&#39;t win, which is why this moment was bound to be exciting.</p>

<p>But the race was even more remarkable. It was raining, and as the race progressed, the gear of Senna&#39;s car started to break down. He missed third, fifth, and then fourth, getting the gearbox stuck in sixth gear. And he finished, and won, the last seven laps of the race with the car like that. The physical exertion he faced to continue the race was so great that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvRdAsxjytA">struggled to lift the trophy</a> and was attended to by the medical team while still on the track.</p>

<p>The second video I showed of Senna with the flag was precisely in that race, the crowd was so ecstatic with the Brazilian&#39;s victory that they invaded the track. I think <a href="https://s2.glbimg.com/S4dKtvn2yY7cjY1cCpHxVRIVXEk=/0x0:2000x1415/1008x0/smart/filters:strip_icc(">this photo</a>/s.glbimg.com/es/ge/f/original/2016/10/09/gettyimages-1230466_rxU9Yrb.jpg) translates well all the emotion, but also physical pain and tiredness, that the racer faced at that moment.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend that you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czjbHr9lY_M">watch this video</a> (in English) where Senna talks about everything he felt in the race and you can also see a little bit of the crowd&#39;s energy that day. But if you&#39;re not interested, it&#39;s worth going to 2:47s just to see how much he screamed at the moment he won the race, still inside the car.</p>

<p><strong>“SENNA… WE ACCELERATED TOGETHER, THE FOURTH CHAMPIONSHIP IS OURS”</strong> </p>

<p>On April 20, 1994, a week before his death, Senna went to Paris to attend the friendly match between the Brazilian football team and Paris Saint Germain/Bordeaux. He kicked the ball at the start of the match. In interviews at the stadium, the three-time champion declared that the team had a better chance of being a fourth-time world champion that year, due to the complicated start of the season for him. That year Brazil actually won the World Cup, unfortunately, Senna didn&#39;t get to see that moment.</p>

<p>(But after the victory, the players paid a beautiful tribute to him in the stadium, playing &quot;Senna&#39;s music&quot; and holding up posters with the words “Senna… we accelerated together, the fourth championship is ours”. — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1235425817293965">the 20s of the video</a>)</p>

<p>This moment is important because people who were there, like the renowned Brazilian presenter Galvão Bueno, remember that despite the rivalry between him and Prost, Senna was heavily applauded at the stadium. This occasion is called by a Brazilian newspaper “<a href="https://www.uol.com.br/esporte/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2022/09/27/em-1994-selecao-em-paris-teve-ultimo-aplauso-a-senna-e-promessa-de-tetra.htm">the last applause to Senna</a>”</p>

<p><strong>“SENNA HITS HARD”</strong></p>

<p>That was the phrase uttered by the narrator Galvão Bueno on May 1, 1994, in the race that was taking place in Italy, the day after the death of fellow racer Roland Ratzenberger.</p>

<p>There are several videos of this moment online, but I won&#39;t link them here because it&#39;s sensitive, although not graphic, given the circumstances set by the crash. I would also advise anyone sensitive not to read this part because it talks about the accident. </p>

<p>Help took almost 2 minutes to attend to him, and something very remarkable at the moment is that the Brazilian narrator, and Senna&#39;s friend, sees a movement of his head and repeats a few times “Senna moves his head, he moves his head”. Formula 1, which would need to stop the race if a death occurred on the track, said that Senna died in hospital, but Brazilian newspapers published that first responders already knew at the scene that Ayrton Senna was brain-dead.</p>

<p>At 1:40 pm, his death was announced on national TV.</p>

<p><strong>BRAZIL POST-SENNA</strong></p>

<p>As I said at the beginning of the write-up, I&#39;ve never known a Brazil other than post-Senna. I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to live that moment. However, from several documentaries, conversations with friends and family, and videos, it is possible to show the moment that was lived with him and the response to the tragedy that was his death. </p>

<p>In the TV Globo documentary Ayrton Senna, numerous interviewees remember that watching the races on Sundays became something that kept many people at home, he popularized a sport that is still so niche (at least in Brazil, when we compare it to football mainly), and became a popular habit of families to watch his races together, tripling the television audience in Brazil of Formula 1. </p>

<p>“He had the ability to make us Brazilians feel proud of being Brazilians when he faced the first world with what was most advanced and won”, says Senna&#39;s sister in the Globo documentary.</p>

<p>My parents always told me that they never forget the moment they received the news of Senna&#39;s death. And millions of other Brazilians have the same feeling. The country declared three days of official mourning and the national commotion was huge. Because it happened so long ago, the images do not have much quality, but it is possible to see <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTmzSfYQ1r2Q3nwULfFAGfFWzA_E34gc9HV-RNHNvOTv0RrYC-f0t8aJZhup6Sva9yu-J8&amp;usqp=CAU">here</a>, <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSWKFRnFOyUuz48GX4TNjtAuUo3_2x38uQppc37-1zOZJ4qfYxFmngr5F9lX18Sw1JSVag&amp;usqp=CAU">here</a>, <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4E3yLGjslPmjVlWDjeLlNh-cGsT79O5Xq6vk5yYRRCVbsK3Wicd0fQ4yJhQYcDd5PeIc&amp;usqp=CAU">here</a> and <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQo2O-wYsjKFvk7efLEK2DlkiGxL3SXwMnV_Q&amp;usqp=CAU">here</a> photos of the popular commotion during his funeral procession. The moment of Senna&#39;s death marks the history of Brazilians, even those who were not yet born like me, as an extremely sad day in our history.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I haven&#39;t had enough space to talk about all the things he did, the surprising victories, or all the stories that surrounded him. But one of the things that struck me the most throughout this research was how much it was repeated how Senna was concerned with safety in Formula 1, that he visited other racers hospitalized due to an accident in the race, sent messages to the families, and was actively trying to look for a way to improve safety. Unfortunately, he was not here to see these advances, but the commotion caused by the deaths of that weekend did bring changes, and today Formula 1 is a much safer sport.</p>

I&#39;m really not in any highly dramatic fan/special interest communities so I&#39;m happy to mooch off of other ones until drama I&#39;m actually qualified to talk about happens. Also, before we begin, special shout-out to YouTube user Fredrik Knudsen, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7PLRddEJH0">video on this topic</a> is one of the funniest things I have ever seen online and who makes amazing content in general that you will almost certainly enjoy if you&#39;re a fan of this subreddit.)</p>

<p>You may have heard the word &quot;Groverhaus&quot; out of context in an online space at one point or another, and given how long it&#39;s been since it was first coined, you might not even be aware of where it originated from or what it represents. What lies beneath the surface, however, is a truly insane and highly entertaining tale of what happens when you combine unrivaled hubris, way too much money, an iron will that would make a Joestar look wishy-washy, and a healthy slather of the Dunning-Kruger effect to taste.</p>

<p><strong>I: Something Awful This Way Comes</strong></p>

<p>Our story begins, as so many have before, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Awful">Something Awful</a> forums. If you&#39;re a younger Internet user, it&#39;s entirely possible that you don&#39;t know about the Something Awful forums, or are at least unaware of its influence. Older users, however, will instantly recognize this otherwise unassuming forum as an absolute monolith of Web culture in the 2000s and early 2010s.</p>

<p>Something Awful is a blog/forum/content aggregation site founded in 1999 that resembles something like a lower-tech Reddit crossed with elements of Cheezburger, 4chan, and maybe early iFunny. Its prime years were between 2002 and 2015 by most accounts, and is notable for being one of the only major forum sites online to charge users a fee in order to activate their accounts. You&#39;ve probably been consuming content that has its origins on SA for years and never even known it. Iconic creepypastas like Slenderman and Zalgo? First concieved on SA. &quot;All Your Base Are Belong To Us?&quot; Became a meme on SA. Let&#39;s Play-style gaming videos? Yup, also a creation of SA. <em>Fucking 4chan itself?</em> Created in response to a hentai ban on SA. Needless to say, this site&#39;s influence is massive and far-reaching, which is sort of remarkable because it&#39;s the only Internet forum I&#39;m aware of that actually charges a fee to use.</p>

<p>However, it is with one specific user out of thousands on this forum that we are concerned with today. One man who dared to go where none had dared to go before, for better or worse. That man&#39;s name was...</p>

<p><strong>II: Grover, of Groverhaus Fame(?)</strong></p>

<p>As near as anyone can tell, seeing as archives of old SA forum posts are spottily preserved and often paywalled, the user known as Grover became active on the site around 2002.  It is unknown whether Grover was his real name or not, though I personally like to picture everyone&#39;s favorite neurotic blue Muppet whenever I mention him by name, so do with that what you will.</p>

<p>Information is scarce about Grover himself for reasons we will come to later, but there are some broad biographical facts floating around out there.  According to his own post history, Grover was an electrical engineer by trade, and made a big deal out of the fact that he had worked for the US Military as a civilian contractor.  So proud was Grover of this fact that he used it as cover to make some <a href="https://twitter.com/SA__moment/status/1550671903085453312">very interesting predictions</a> about foreign policy and (allegedly) to claim the rank of Major, which he rationalized by saying that he earned as much money as an actual Major-ranked officer, so the title was up for grabs.</p>

<p>Because people just love it so much when the Grovers of the world claim to have military experience despite only being adjacent to actual servicemen and women, he was already a controversial figure by the time he was made a forum moderator, which occurred sometime before 2006, the year when all hell broke loose.</p>

<p><strong>III: Grover&#39;s Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Idea</strong></p>

<p>On December 30, 2006, at around 10:23 PM server time, Grover started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071012102618/https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2253640">thread that would come to define his legacy</a>.  An excerpt from his original post in this thread follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I are building an <del>$80k</del> <em>$85k</em> 2000 square-foot addition onto our house- and we’re doing it completely by ourselves. Framing, sheathing, roofing, doors, windows, flooring, plumbing, electrical, housewrap, kitchen, stairs, tile, trim- everything but the concrete and siding. (And we later got lazy on the drywall, too…) Our existing house is 1600 square feet (3-bedroom, 2-bath), but the kitchen sucks and we have no garage and have absolutely no storage space- ever since we moved in, we talked about building an addition, but all we ever did was build a 12x12 shed that became our lawnmower garage/storage room/woodshop/autoshop/garden shed which helped, but is woefully inadequate. The new addition adds a new kitchen, 2-car garage, workshop area, 3 bedrooms (more accurately, a sewing room, guest bedroom and storage room), a bathroom and a living room.  </p>

<p>[...] Our goals for the eventual addition were 3-fold: garage, storage and new kitchen. Unfortunately, with the state of our septic system and zoning setback restrictions, any addition was a pipe dream. But, then, in March 2005, we found out that a developer had bought up all the vacant lots in our neighborhood that wouldn’t perk and was going to be installing city sewer! This was quite a godsend- first off, the land back here is swampland, flooded half the year, and should never have been built on- we were very much looking forward to being able to reliably flush toilets a full 12 months out of the year, and even when it’s raining! Also, being able to close the septic field meant we could finally build the addition!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone who has ever done any kind of home improvement job, big or small, will notice a few red flags already. For those of you who have never done such a thing before, doing any kind of home improvement project more involved than changing a lightbulb is usually, to use the scientific term, a giant pain in the ass. Homes are big objects with a lot of co-dependent parts in them, and when you mess with one thing, it&#39;s going to inevitably mess with something else in the process and cost you a small fortune to climb out of the hole you&#39;ve put yourself in before you&#39;ve even begun to fix what you originally set out to fix. To build a massive, brand new home extension from the ground up, using your own plans, while directing your own fleet of contractors, with only cursory knowledge of what goes into making a home habitable, is bold at best and a fool&#39;s errand at worst.</p>

<p>But Grover was no fool. He&#39;s (at one point been adjacent to people who have) been in the military, dammit! He won&#39;t be defeated by these seemingly long odds! Would General Patton have turned tail and bailed back home when the chips were down in North Africa? I hardly think so. He would have his Groverhaus. Which brings us to...</p>

<p><strong>IV: Working On A Dream</strong></p>

<p>Grover went on to post several more times, detailing almost every step of the process of building his new extension.  The original thread, preserved lovingly in (what seems to be) its original, unpaywalled glory by the Wayback Machine, is linked above, and you can read through all of Grover&#39;s methods if you so choose.  Below, I will directly quote a few of my favorite snippets, with commentary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other problem was financing- we didn’t have $80k for the addition, nor did we have $80k equity in the house nor could we find anyone who would loan us $80k for a reasonable mortgage rate. What we ended up doing was taking out a $27k home equity loan- nearly all the equity the housing boom had given us for “free”, which would be enough to frame, roof and seal the addition. Then, we’d get the house reappraised in the hopes that our $27k had given us another $53k in equity so we could finish! Early Dec, we got the loan, pulled the permits, decided on a foundation guy and Dec 17, 2005, we broke ground!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, the years before the &#39;08 recession. It was a simpler time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, mid-dec, we’re digging, trying to work it before it rains- problem is, the water table back here is 6” below the surface, and even with sump pumps running, the water is just percolating up through the soft clay and turning the whole thing into a messy muddy mess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was later discovered that Grover lived in the Chesapeake Bay area, (specifically, somewhere not far south of Norfolk, VA) which makes me wonder exactly who told him it would be a good idea to break ground on an expansive construction project in the middle of fucking December.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also at this stage, we discovered that the 100’ fiberglass tape measure that I used to square off the foundation stretched about ¾” over 50’ and had f’ed up our foundation pins, making the one wall of our house 1.5” shorter than the other, and overall screwing up my perfect plans. poo poo happens, though, I bought a sawzall, and we worked around it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. Lmao, even.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I started roughing on the electrical- ran conduit through the attic from the new box in the garage to the existing box in the house, and started putting in lights and boxes and about $1000 worth of cable- cable that had literally tripled in price from the same time the year before. I don’t have many pictures of me wiring, but it was extremely time consuming and ate up over a month of evenings and weekends. I jerry-rigged power as soon as the lights were up, though, which was very convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think &quot;the electrical wiring of the house my family and I will be living in&quot; is something I really wouldn&#39;t &quot;jerry-rig&quot; for convenience, even for a little bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and the tie-in with the existing house! In my case, I decided it was easier just to put in a 2nd wall, as I would have had to dick too much with the roof to try to tie straight in; the existing footer wasn&#39;t really built for a 2-story house, either. This will also allow for the settling in the addition to (hopefuly) be even. I ended up undercutting my foundation and pouring a new footer about a foot deeper than the old footer, which the masons blocked up, with a 1&quot; gap. Wasn&#39;t enough- the existing wall bowed in 1.5&quot; which ended up messing with my new walls too, which sucked :( You can&#39;t tell in the finished house, but it was readily apparent when hanging the kitchen cabinets, and it still bothers me that my wall isn&#39;t perfectly plumb! The two walls are nailed together at several places, most notably, I nailed the the ceiling in the old kitchen to the header I put on the new wall when I broke the new opening between the two. I placed a 2x6 above the existing joists in the attic, used 16D nails to nail through to the new triped 2x12 header, and put on hurricane straps to support the existing joists. Then I knocked out the 2x4s holding the ceiling up. So, essentially, the ceiling is now suspected by hurricane straps from a board nailed through sheeting into the other wall! I hope there isn&#39;t much settlings between the walls, heh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsJc2ZhbXIg">Relevant Spongebob clip.</a> This particular episode in the construction process birthed the phrase &quot;load-bearing drywall&quot; and became by far the most infamous quote from the entire debacle. To add some context, what Grover has done here is basically the equivalent of balancing a breezeblock on top of a particularly sturdy house of cards and praying the result holds up above your own head.</p>

<p><strong>V: Laugh-Bearing Images</strong></p>

<p>To boot, Grover was sure to include several images to help forumites visualize what he was up to during each stage of the building process. While many of these photos have unfortunately been lost to time, what survives paints a good enough picture of exactly what was going down with the Groverhaus.</p>

<p>(Special thanks to the fine folks at Know Your Meme, which I confess I did not know still existed, and Twitter user BoldlyBuilding2 preserving most of these images.)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1828364-groverhaus">Grover&#39;s original mockup</a> of what he wanted the house to look like, rendered in what many believe to be Microsoft Paint. He later posted <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKA0hpVWkAAgonv.jpg">a more sophisticated one</a> drawn up in AutoCAD, but it&#39;s all about first impressions.</li>
<li>Did I mention that Grover lived in the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1828366-groverhaus">swamps of the Mid-Atlantic</a> and did most of his construction during the winter? Note the toolshed in the back with the Popeye-esque pipe sticking out of it.</li>
<li>When construction on the Groverhaus was finally finished, Grover and company got out the barbecue for a celebratory dinner, as all good Americans should. However, Grover neglected to move his grill away from the recently-laid vinyl siding on the new extension, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1828368-groverhaus">which immediately melted</a> and had to be replaced.</li>
<li>The infamous <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1828361-groverhaus">insulated stairs</a>. Is it me, or is that window way too low?</li>
<li><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKA19hUXUAAtLGN.jpg">What <em>is</em> HVAC, anyway?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKB9h-KXYAAuhNU.jpg">Plumbing</a> seemed a particularly large bugbear for Grover. Looks like a rest stop I once encountered outside of Bowling Green.</li>
<li><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKCAk5NWoAAVtJZ.jpg">The Groverhaus, completed.</a> Many people have said that the dual-garage system that Grover added gave the house the appearance of someone screaming.</li>
<li>Say what you will about Grover and his house, he does have <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKCQBNOWkAAhOAh.jpg">an adorable cat.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1828395-groverhaus">This one</a> and the mud picture seem to be the most readily available images when researching the Groverhaus, and what a doozy it is.  The TV that&#39;s too large for the table, the janky-ass soundsystem with the woofer placed on top of the VCR for some reason, the recessed lighting that will scorch the corneas of anyone unfortunate enough to come over and watch that Bearcats game he&#39;s got on TV, it&#39;s got everything.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VI: The Aftermath</strong></p>

<p>If you know anything about online hobby drama, you knew where this was going to wind up going about two sections ago. Both DIY enthusiasts and the general populace alike gathered en masse to point and laugh at Grover and his homunculus of a house, and Grover was not amused. Using his moderator privileges, he began deleting all negative posts related to him and his house. This, in a textbook case of the Streisand effect, only grew the house&#39;s infamy and cemented it as a landmark event in the site&#39;s history. As recently as 2015, people were <em>still</em> making threads about the Groverhaus.</p>

<p>Because of Grover&#39;s burn-and-salt approach to squashing criticism, it&#39;s rather difficult to actually find posts and responses to his original writings as they came out, and we must rely on what little is available in the SA archives and what has been passed along outside the forums for its meme potential. At one time, Twitter user 3liza had a fairly definitive and in-depth thread about the Groverhaus up on her account, but she has since been suspended and the thread was not saved in time. Nonetheless, content creators have rediscovered Grover&#39;s saga and done some really excellent documentary work about it. Fredrik Knudsen&#39;s video is linked at the top of this post, but I also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVUTVfHcc7c&amp;list=PLY-qDXZrfG_c1D9MpxLOFCd05-hMsE6pf&amp;index=2">Well, There&#39;s Your Problem</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7C6XBUkXeQ">Demon Mama&#39;s</a> takes on the subject as well. At this point in time, the Groverhaus and everything connected to it have essentially become linguistic shorthand for shoddy, two-bit, side-project construction jobs.</p>

<p>In more recent Groverhaus news, in 2022, popular gaming channel Yogscast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnLP19VM64">posted a video</a> of themselves playing the GMod gamemode &quot;Trouble in Terrorist Town&quot; using a rough approximation of the Groverhaus created by tumblr user Slunch as a map.</p>

<p><strong>VII: Elegy For A Groverhaus</strong></p>

<p>In the years since the original Groverhaus thread, there&#39;s been frustratingly little information about what has happened to anyone involved with it. Because of Something Awful&#39;s arcane archival system, I was unable to confirm exactly what happened to Grover after the original post: whether he got banned, continued moderating, or simply disappeared is unknown. Some claim to have found the house on Google Earth, but those who have were unwilling to divulge the exact coordinates out of respect for the privacy of whoever owns the home now, be that Grover or otherwise. Home-buying sites like Zillow do not have recognizable listings or estimates for the property, and because of the house&#39;s somewhat remote location in the vast coastal wasteland between Norfolk and Raleigh, it&#39;s unlikely that someone could find it simply by taking a road trip through the general area.</p>

<p>The Groverhaus story is compelling not only for Grover&#39;s misplaced confidence and the ludicrous final product, but for the fact that it ends on something of a mystery. Where is Grover now? Does he still live there? Was he ultimately happy with what he built? Did he ever pay that loan back? None of these questions are likely to ever see answers, and the information we have only seems to generate more questions the longer we study it.</p>

<p>Perhaps some things just weren&#39;t meant for us to know.</p>

<h2>[Student Government] The story of Georgetown's 2022 presidential election: A tale of booze, tryhards, general idiocy, Sith lords, sex workers, and a whooooooole lot of drama.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Electronic_Duck_9428 </span><span class = "numcomments">274 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uww8oe/student_government_the_story_of_georgetowns_2022/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(342)">View full post</button><div id="342" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(This post was made using a throwaway account, since I have to go to class with these people. Names have been changed to comply with rule 1).</p>

<p>This story is a wild fucking ride, and it deserves to be preserved somewhere for future generations of students. I&#39;ve tried my best to do justice to the sheer insanity of it all. Hold on, this is gonna be long, and it just keeps getting weirder.</p>

<p>Georgetown is located in Washington DC, which, believe it or not, means that politics are a <em>huge</em> part of life on campus. You know that super annoying political kid from college? Yeah, that&#39;s the <em>majority</em> of people. And, as you can imagine, that means a <em>lot</em> of kids have political ambitions. The student government is called GUSA (Georgetown University Student Association). To get an idea of GUSA, imagine the twisted lovechild of overachieving college students, combined with a near total lack of actual power, and organizational efficiency that makes the DMV look like a well oiled machine. Now, imagine the most pretentious, overachieving, politically obsessed college kids... and picture them in an environment that <em>actively encourages</em> that behavior. Yeah. It&#39;s bad.</p>

<p><strong>What is GUSA?</strong></p>

<p>So, in a little more detail, GUSA is our student government. There&#39;s an executive and legislative branch. The executive has two elected presidents who then choose members of their own staff; the legislative is made up of senators for each class (based on the number of students), with a few senators elected by all students.</p>

<p>GUSA&#39;s actual power is... limited. Essentially, most of their job is creating elaborate petitions (which the school can just... ignore). Most of their actual power lies in their influence. In theory, they work as a middleman, bringing concerns from all student groups to the administration. So, while lacking direct power, they can (hypothetically) exert pressure. Their main direct power lies in controlling the student activities fund. Collected annually from every student, it&#39;s around $1.4 million annually distributed to student clubs and organizations.</p>

<p>Most of campus tends to just kind of ignore GUSA. They&#39;re sort of like theater kids: very wrapped up in their own drama and self importance, but no one else really takes much note. Much of that is actually by design. GUSA&#39;s official website hasn&#39;t been updated in years, their meeting place is often not made public (despite the fact that it&#39;s supposed to be, for public complaints), and they&#39;re known for being very insular. Even if students want to stay aware, they&#39;re often unable to do so.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also probably good to give a brief description of politics on campus. Georgetown has a reputation for being very liberal, which isn&#39;t exactly <em>wrong</em>, but it&#39;s not the whole picture. Explaining it could be a whole post of its own, but for simplicity: people have a strange mix of views on social values, domestic policy, economic practices, foreign policy, etc. Someone may be super in favor of abortion, but also think all taxation is theft and that we should increase military spending.</p>

<p><strong>The presidential election of 2022: A quick timeline</strong></p>

<p>During the fall, GUSA had put forth a referendum to abolish itself, planning on tearing the organization down to build it back up. They failed. They failed at getting rid of themselves. (This is kinda relevant later, but I also just find it hilarious, and want to share it).</p>

<p>The previous president and vice president had been... OK. They had both been involved in campus advocacy before being elected, and marked the first black woman to ever be student president, which was great. In general, they did very little (largely due to Covid), which suited most people just fine.</p>

<p>The election started pretty much as usual, with a campaign run by career GUSA kids  (which we&#39;ll call L-K). Both of them had years of experience in GUSA, they had worked with the previous administration, and were pretty much regarded as the favorites. Most of their campaign promises were the same basic ones that were always promised, and never followed through on. They were useless, but in a comfortable, familiar way. (Also, their campaign slogan was &quot;gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss&quot;. That gives a pretty decent picture of the energy they had: trying to be popular without actually understanding what they referenced.)</p>

<p>The election first started to go off the rails with the second campaign -- Wume. Two frat bros with zero experience in GUSA, and basically no real campaign platform. Their (very limited) campaign promises involved getting rid of the mask mandate, and redirecting all funding away from SNAPs (a group tasked with finding cases of underage drinking on campus). They heavily played up their outsider status, suggesting that students were tired of GUSA, and wanted something new.</p>

<p><strong>The first scandal</strong></p>

<p>Even with Wume running, it was still a pretty typical election. Most people didn&#39;t really care that much, and just assumed that the GUSA kids would win, as per usual.</p>

<p>However, soon after the L-K campaign was announced, people started coming forward with concerns. Previous GUSA members had issues with how L and K had acted, including a complaint that they&#39;d sent out an official email using their superior&#39;s account. Additionally, their list of past accomplishments stole credit from other students, including a members of marginalized groups.</p>

<p>After a few days of this, L-K decided to address it head on. They issued a half-hearted apology. In short, they apologized for the things they&#39;d been caught on, while not actually showing much remorse, and continuing with business as usual.</p>

<p>Most of the campus didn&#39;t know or care about this. The general response was &quot;Gee, the attention seeking tryhards lied and were assholes, what a shocker&quot;. The campaign continued as usual.</p>

<p><strong>The second scandal</strong></p>

<p>On February 2nd, the GUSA election commission released an official warning for Wume, and announced an investigation. Why? Because over the weekend, there had been a wild, boozy party at a nightclub called Abigail&#39;s. A party, which had been sponsored and paid for by the Wume campaign. How did the election commission know? Because they put up a neon sign with their names and campaign on it. An anonymous source sent in a picture of the sign, with the accusation.</p>

<p>So, why is that a big deal? First, GUSA has rules on how much you can spend on your campaign, all of which has to be tracked and reported. The amount for this campaign was $300. At <em>minimum</em>, that nightclub would cost $500, probably more. Additionally, having alcohol at any club or student sponsored event is a <em>major</em> no-no. Like, getting suspended or expelled. Finally, providing any kind of offering to voters that could influence or bribe them is strictly prohibited. Soooo... yeah.</p>

<p>At first, Wume remained pretty quiet, only speaking to insist that the burden of proof lay with the election commission, and therefore, they would not be assisting the investigation.  As a result, lacking conclusive evidence, the election commission issued a warning, and limited their speaking time at the first debate.</p>

<p>On February 4th, Wume made an official response. And <em>oh boy</em> did they come out swinging. I can&#39;t share their full instagram post here, since it involves their names, but a quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>They denied all connection to the party, and claimed that they&#39;d provided proof that they hadn&#39;t paid for it.</li>
<li>They accused the election commission of bias, suggesting that the commission was trying to illegally knock them out of the race.</li>
<li>They made an official demand that the commission retract their warning, delete the related Instagram post, give them equal speaking time, and issue an official apology.</li>
<li>They compared their situation to voter suppression in America. Seriously.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Somehow, Palpatine returned.</strong></p>

<p>The third entry to the campaign was Emperor Sheev Palpatine. Please note: that&#39;s not a fake name. An anonymous student started an Instagram account, with the following announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greetings my future subjects. I am pleased to announce my candidacy for GUSA President. Most members of GUSA lie about their intentions in order to gain power. On February 10, vote for a candidate who is honest about his desire for complete and utter control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Palpatine ran under the slogan &quot;somehow, not the worst candidate&quot;. He soon issued a statement with his campaign goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>All club funding would be immediately rerouted to a third Death Star</li>
<li>Campus police would be eliminated, and replaced with an army of stormtroopers</li>
<li>The unpopular meal plan would be revoked, because &quot;I&#39;m a Sith, but there&#39;s some shit even <em>I</em> think is too evil&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember those scandals from two seconds ago? Well, Palpatine had fun responding. He also issued an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JaRC17Z">apology</a> to the community, addressing his &quot;controversies&quot; (such as the Jedi purge and totalitarian regime), as well as poking fun at L-K. And when Wume made their official statement, Palpatine responded rapidly with his own <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QssNOXk">response</a>. He accused the election commission of &quot;anti-sith bias&quot;, banning him from debates just for &quot;using my lightning to attack other candidates&quot;.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Palpatine appeared on an episode of the Hilltop Show, a campus comedy group (think amateur Jon Stewart). Again, I can&#39;t link it because it includes actual names, but some highlights involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Claiming that he&#39;d attempted to recruit the University&#39;s president as a Sith apprentice, but soon realized &quot;that dude was <em>way</em> more evil than me&quot;.</li>
<li>Pointing out that stormtroopers would be far safer than campus police, since &quot;Those guys can never hit a main character. If they <em>do</em> end up killing someone, nobody will care about them.&quot;</li>
<li>Promising a greater focus on constructing AT-ATs to monitor campus</li>
<li>Generally enforcing his iron will through threats, mind control, brainwashing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MO enter the race</strong></p>

<p>With all the controversy going around, more and more students started actually paying attention to the election, prompting a fourth entry into our little drama: the MO campaign. Both of them had some experience in GUSA, but also had worked with a number of other clubs and advocacy groups on campus. They offered a middle ground: people who knew how the system worked, but didn&#39;t have strong ties to it, who had a track record of actually getting things done with other clubs.</p>

<p>They released their campaign platform, which... was actually pretty decent? A lot of it was the same vague/impossible promises everyone made, but they also included realistic quality of life improvements, like providing trans inclusive housing, and offering better conditions for student workers. The one weird part was promising to decriminalize sex work on campus. Nobody really knew why they included that, since, at least publicly, there was zero knowledge of anything like that on campus, but people kind of just accepted it as one weird spot in an otherwise pretty good campaign.</p>

<p>There was just one problem. Remember that joke about the DMV from the start though? Well, because MO hadn&#39;t filled out the proper paperwork in time, they couldn&#39;t run. There was a long appeal process, which I&#39;m not even going to try getting into (it involved a vote to see if they could have a vote on another vote, as well as some tearful speeches), but in the end, they were not allowed on the ballot. GUSA compromised, by providing a write-in option. As MO pointed out, since most students ignored the campaigning, and just kind of checked a box randomly, that put them at a disadvantage, since it required all students going in to know them specifically.</p>

<p><strong>The first debate: president vs president vs president vs Emperor</strong></p>

<p>With all the drama leading up to it, the debate got way, way more attention than it would have otherwise. The Zoom call was filled with people, as well as with drama. Several times, someone would join, unmute themselves, and scream loudly, or yell profanity, until they were kicked out. A quick summary of how each campaign did:</p>

<p><strong>LK:</strong> Like bland white bread, which was pretty much on brand for them. Nothing special, they gave the kind of vague answer to every question an experienced politician gives.</p>

<p><strong>Wume:</strong> Hoooooo boy. First off, since the election commission refused to retract their punishment, they had fewer questions. But, as the debate continued, it became very clear just how <em>terrible</em> he was. He swung back and forth between either agreeing with his opponent (and sitting in silence for the rest of his 90 seconds), or promising something completely impossible (like tearing up every road on campus and allowing only bikes).</p>

<p><strong>Palpatine:</strong> As an unofficial candidate, he was not allowed to speak. He&#39;d answer questions in the zoom chat, usually with a Star Wars quote or joke. Partway through, he was kicked out, only to return a few times, lasting only a few minutes before getting kicked out again.</p>

<p><strong>MO</strong>: Pretty decent, but severely limited by not being an official candidate. Because of that, they had to answer all questions in the chat, and couldn&#39;t ask for rebuttal time or for a question to be repeated.</p>

<p><strong>We don&#39;t talk about Wume</strong></p>

<p>Before the debate, most people had sort of treated Wume like joke candidates -- that&#39;s what most people assumed they were. But with the scandals, and their performance in the debate, people started to get legitimately worried. Wume had refused or ignored all attempts by student newspapers to interview them. They&#39;d shown little to no interest in reaching out to advocacy groups on campus (a GUSA tradition), and had publicly admitted that they didn&#39;t know how GUSA worked. When asked to name three student organizations, they were unable to do so., During the debate, one even was confused, and thought that GUSA had successfully abolished itself.</p>

<p>Their one serious goal, which they rested their entire campaign on, was to end the mask mandate on campus. With that, worries started coming in. There were still serious concerns about Covid on campus, especially with immunocompromised students, concerns that Wume publicly refused to address.</p>

<p>The two of them were also well known as conservatives, with their main support coming from conservative clubs on campus. Rumors and accusations started to trickle in that maybe the support came from beyond campus -- Turning Point USA (a far right group) had a history of secretly funding conservative student government candidates to &quot;own the libs&quot;, and get rid of Covid restrictions. And a party at a DC nightclub wasn&#39;t cheap. However, no concrete connections could be proved.</p>

<p>Additionally, more people started pointing out how little actual campaigning they&#39;d done. No flyers, no interviews, very little social media presence, treating the debates like a joke... it almost seemed like they weren&#39;t worried about getting elected. As if it were already guaranteed. The issue with GUSA is, they use ranked choice voting, and voter turnout tends to be very low. So, if you can convince a relatively small group to <em>only</em> vote for you, it can seriously swing the vote. Accusations flew of election tampering, and bribery.</p>

<p>Those accusations were only made worse when reports came that a student journalist had been impersonated by someone else. The failed plan involved using that students&#39; email account to send out false claims against Wume, then publicly counter them, in an attempt to discredit their criticism. However, the attempt failed, and the culprit was never found.</p>

<p><strong>This is the Voice</strong></p>

<p>Shortly after the debate, the Georgetown Voice (a campus newspaper) released an editorial titled &quot;Write-in &#39;MO&#39; for GUSA Exec&quot;. In short, it publicly endorsed the pair as the best (and only) option. It threw some serious shade at both other campaigns, calling L-K &quot;ultimately disappointing and represents a decaying institution&quot;, and Wume &quot;a campaign that is unserious and actively unsafe for students&quot;.</p>

<p>The editorial went into more detail on the scandals, bringing them up to students who had not known about them before. Additionally, it dug deeper, revealing additional details about the nightclub party, and about their platform. The Voice managed to get the only actual interview with Wume (and may have caused them to refuse others), because they went through each question, step by step, and tore their campaign apart. The interview showed just how little Wume actually knew, and how limited their plans were.</p>

<p><strong>Palpatine gets real</strong></p>

<p>The night after the debate, Palpatine&#39;s Instagram account went on a bit of a rant. I unfortunately don&#39;t have the exact transcripts saved, but the general gist was: he was tired of GUSA. The campaign had started as a joke, but running it had become more and more depressing as he&#39;d gotten a closer view at how GUSA worked. As has been made abundantly clear, GUSA as a whole does very little... but still wields pretty significant power, <em>especially</em> over the budget. However, he had a bit of hope, in that other student groups on campus were actually working to make change. So, his message shifted: now, a vote for him wasn&#39;t just a joke, it was a statement to GUSA that they were out of touch.</p>

<p><strong>The side campaigns</strong></p>

<p>At this point, with all the chaos going on, and with Palpatine being a very prominent joke candidate, a few other competitors entered the running. Most of them are minor enough that we don&#39;t need to bother going through (they tended to be limited to joking &quot;we&#39;re running!&quot; statements on social media). The one mildly significant campaign came from the Heckler (think the Onion, but on a college campus). They ran a duo whose sole message was that they&#39;d do nothing -- which would be better than the alternative.</p>

<p><strong>The Vice presidential debate</strong></p>

<p>The VP debate eventually came up. There was less interest in it than the presidential one, but still far, <em>far</em> more than usual elections. I&#39;m not going to bother running through each campaign again, partly because I can&#39;t remember the details super well, and partly because their performances stayed pretty much the same. L-K was still bland, Wume was still woefully unprepared, MO still was stuck in the chat.</p>

<p>The one slightly significant event came from Palpatine, who had promised to show up wearing a black hood and robe. When the debate started, unlike before, only official candidates and moderators were allowed to turn their cameras on. A few minutes into the debate, Palpatine was kicked out, and not allowed back in.</p>

<p><strong>The conclusion: Election Day cometh</strong></p>

<p>By this point, tensions were running high. People who had never cared about a GUSA election in their lives actually started to pay attention. In the leadup to the election, MO frantically pushed people to share the rules on write-ins so that they&#39;d have a chance to win.</p>

<p>There was some worry from the election commission itself about getting the election software to work. I don&#39;t know enough about it to really get into detail, but the TL;DR is that they thought it wouldn&#39;t work, but then it did, after several frantic hours of recoding.</p>

<p>The election came around, people cast their ballots, and the results officially came in... Wume had won. Palpatine released a photoshopped version of the announcement, giving himself &quot;eleventy billon&quot; votes, celebrating victory, but the other campaigns conceded.</p>

<p><strong>What could have been</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the issue though: remember that ranked choice voting thing? The short version is, you can list your candidates in order of preference. Then, they go through in &quot;rounds&quot;, with the lowest candidate getting eliminated each time. This continues until there&#39;s only one left. If your first choice is eliminated, then your second choice gets your vote.</p>

<p>So, where&#39;s the problem? <em>MO had been winning</em>. With the three serious campaigns left, the votes were tallied at:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>L-K: 365  </p>

<p>MO: 687  </p>

<p>Wume: 614</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, L-K was eliminated... and most of the people who had voted for them ranked Wume second, leaving the tally 759 to 793.</p>

<p>As MO pointed out, most of that was because students just filled out the ballot by ranking the official choices (often randomly). Had they been allowed to be on the ballot themselves, they would have have had far greater odds of winning. As you might expect, this caused some controversy, as well as questions on changing election procedure.</p>

<p><strong>The grand finale</strong></p>

<p>As the final cherry on top of this shit sundae, several GUSA senators moved for an investigation into the election, alleging numerous complaints of fraud and bribery.</p>

<p>The old accusations were brought to light, with new evidence: a member of the Wume campaign <em>had</em> paid for the nightclub party... but not either of the two candidates. By technicality, they could claim to be uninvolved. Other students brought up how they had overheard people who had been at the party confirming the &quot;beer for votes&quot; theory, but there was not enough evidence to prove anything.</p>

<p>The election commission stated that the election was valid, and they would not overturn the results. However, they also  pointedly stated that Wume had refused to cooperate with them, and had attempted to bait them into revealing bias. The outgoing president also made a statement, stating that she was &quot;so disappointed in who’s inheriting this position.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, one of the senators resigned, stating that GUSA had become exhausting, and that she didn&#39;t want to have to deal with this level of drama all the time, which... fair.</p>

<p><strong>The Epilogue</strong></p>

<p>Wume took power without any further issue. So far, they&#39;ve been a bit of a campus meme: stupid, but not actively terrible, as GUSA fades into the background again. However, they also have been selling Wume <em>merch</em>, which is... an idea, and are reportedly going to massively slash club budgets (so maybe prepare for a volume two of this post).</p>

<p>L-K and MO accepted their loss pretty graciously. Both are still involved in plenty of work on campus, and have continued almost exactly as they were before.</p>

<p>The GUSA election commission is now officially being paid for their work, which honestly, they deserve. The institution as a whole kinda sucks, but they&#39;re three people who have to deal with a <em>mountain</em> of bullshit impartially, and have to do hours of work each election.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Edit: How could I forget one of the best parts? In response to L-K&#39;s slogan &quot;Gaslight the administration, Gatekeep student rights, Girlboss GUSA&quot;, Palpatine released his own slogan: &quot;Manipulate the Jedi, Mansplain the Force, Malewife the Mandalorian&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On November 28, <strong>Dragonflight</strong>, the ninth expansion in the popular video game (and frequent Hobby Drama subject) World of Warcraft, released. Our story follows the calamitous ramifications that came from the overlooking of one line of code in the weeks before this expansion&#39;s launch. But in the words of Nozdormu there is only one true timeline, and the events which will eventually set this story into motion begin more than 10 years ago, on September 25, 2012.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Part 1: Out of the Mists</h1>

<p>On September 25, 2012, Mists of Pandaria, the fourth World of Warcraft expansion, released. Players rushed to explore the newly-discovered island of Pandaria seeking riches, adventure, and of course, mounts.</p>

<h3><em>What are mounts (and why should I care)?</em></h3>

<p>For those who haven&#39;t played WoW or similar online games, players tend to focus heavily on making sure that their character <em>looks</em> cool. Whether it’s to stand out in groups and show off, or because players enjoy dressing up and decorating their avatars to fit the story they want to weave around them, character appearance and accessories are a central aspect of the game. Much like in real life, people in-game dress up to impress both others and themselves. </p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to do this, but one of the most common ones is collecting mounts (the vehicles that players use to run, swim, and fly around in the world). Mounts are large, flashy and, unlike armor and weapons, don’t become obsolete when a new expansion releases. Like other rewards in the game, mounts come in varying degrees of rarity, with the least attainable often being the most coveted, and some are incredibly rare. Some of the rarest mounts in the game are owned by less than 1% of the playerbase years after their introduction to the game, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BbGLqid.jpg">and ones that can be traded outside the game can go for absolutely obscene amounts of money.</a></p>

<p>Not all players farm mounts based on their prestige, mind you. Some simply go after mounts that they think look cool. At present there are <a href="https://www.dataforazeroth.com/collections/mounts">over 900 mounts in the game</a>, ranging from <a href="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/108480-reins-of-the-bronze-drake.jpg">dragons</a> to <a href="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/983372-invincibles-reins-booyaa.jpg">an undead flying horse named Invincible</a> to <a href="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/479770-mimirons-head.jpg">a giant robot helicopter head</a>, so rest assured that there’s something for everyone! </p>

<p>However, every once in awhile you get a mount that’s both obscenely rare <em>and</em> that the community thinks looks especially cool, and suddenly everyone wants it; either so that they can fly around on it, or so that they can flex on the noobs that can’t. </p>

<h3>Back to Pandaria: Enter The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent</h3>

<p>It’s 2012. As players storm the shores of Pandaria, many charge towards a new world boss called <strong>The Sha of Anger</strong>, one of a pair of newly added and extremely difficult enemies that randomly spawn in two of the game’s outdoor zones. The Sha can be killed every 15 minutes, but can only be looted once per week, with the chance to award high-quality armor (among other things). Many players are hunting down the Sha to get said armor (their old gear having become obsolete with the new expansion), but many more are after a more elusive prize listed on the boss’s loot table: <a href="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/570281-reins-of-the-heavenly-onyx-cloud-serpent.jpg">[The Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent]</a>. </p>

<p>The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is coveted because of its visually striking design and bright colors. It both looks good and stands out in a crowd (literally glowing with bright white light), which means everyone wants it. But as more and more of the unwashed masses spill upon the continent of Pandaria to slay the Sha in an attempt to get their very own photonegative dragon, one thing becomes clear. It’s rare. Possibly more rare than any mount added to an enemy’s loot table before. Unlucky players who didn’t get the mount on their first try will have to simply wait until the weekly loot-lockout resets on Tuesday to try and kill him again, or bring their alts (additional characters on their account) to kill him for extra tries. </p>

<p>The weeks pass by. Players begin doing the new raids and out-gear the armor offered by the Sha of Anger, but he continues to be beaten to death nearly as soon as he spawns by a massive, rabid community of increasingly frustrated mount hunters. The more kills players rack up without seeing the mount, the more rare they realize it is, which makes getting it all the more prestigious and increases the desire to farm it further. Someone asks Blizzard to confirm the mount is actually in the game and there isn’t some hidden requirement to unlock it, which Blizzard does, insisting that it just has a low drop rate. </p>

<p>Weeks turn to months. Someone runs a database search and discovers that <strong>nobody in the game of 10 million players has the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent yet</strong>. They take this information to a forum post that’s directed at Blizzard. The community becomes upset as they realize they’ve been farming a mount that may not actually be in the game yet. Blizzard realizes they made a mistake. </p>

<h3>Oops, no dragons! - <em>How Blizzard broke the Sha’s loot table (the first time)</em></h3>

<p>So what happened? Well, the Sha of Anger’s loot table works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game internally rolls a random number ranging from 1 to 100. </p></li>
<li><p>If the game rolls a 1 to 59, the player receives gold and nothing else happens.</p></li>
<li><p>If the game rolls a 60 to 100, the player is marked as receiving a piece of loot, at which point the game rolls a SECOND random number to determine what piece of gear the player is awarded from a weighted loot table of class-specific armor (so that a rogue doesn’t accidentally get paladin armor, which they can’t use). The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is on this loot table as an incredibly low drop. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Well, that’s how it’s <em>supposed</em> to work. In reality, Blizzard either never added the Heavenly Onyx Serpent to the loot table, or accidentally set the weighted chance of awarding it to 0. (They never clarified which they had done, only that they’d made a mistake and fixed it).</p>

<p>So we’re a few months into Mists of Pandaria and all is finally right with the world (of Warcraft). The Sha of Anger has begun dropping its mount as intended. Overjoyed (and irate) players flock to kill him with new found hope and optimism and soon discover a second, far more horrifying truth…</p>

<p><strong>It’s still insanely rare.</strong></p>

<p>The reason Blizzard took so long to realize the mount wasn’t dropping was because, even when correctly added to the loot table, it was so rare that it almost never dropped. The game doesn’t officially publish any sort of drop percentages for its loot, but estimations made by players put it somewhere between a 0.02% to a 0.01% drop rate. That means that on average, the Sha will drop <em>one</em> mount every 7,500 kills. One of, if not <strong>the</strong>, lowest drop rate of any mount in the game.  </p>

<p>When it became clear just how rare this mount truly was, many players (such as myself) gave up on farming it. It just wasn’t worth the hours of camping and thousands of attempts it would take (spread out over multiple years or multiple max-level alts) to farm the Sha for such a tiny chance at getting the mount, no matter how cool it looked. Others made as many characters as they could and parked them at the spawn points to get as many kills as they could each week, racking up thousands of kills over hundreds (or thousands) of hours of farming.</p>

<p>And the world (of warcraft) spun on. The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent remained one of the most prestigious mounts in the game due to its unique look, bugged introduction, and tiny drop chance. After ten years of farming it’s owned by less than 1% of the game’s playerbase, and when it occasionally appears on the Black Market Auction House (an in-game market where a single instance of a rare non-tradeable item is made available for purchase at auction with gold) it regularly goes for the game’s maximum gold cap of 9,999,999 gold (currently valued at 900 USD <a href="https://wowtokenprices.com/">based on the WoW game-time token’s US regional price</a>).</p>

<h1>Part 2: The Unwitting Herald(s)</h1>

<p>On September 11, 2022, nearly 10 years to the day from the first explorers setting foot onto the shores of Pandaria and beginning the long chain of events that are now so close to their culmination, a redditor by the name of <a href="/u/Jibbles2020">u/Jibbles2020</a> will <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/xbtu4a/yeah_so_i_just_got_the_heavenly_onyx_cloud/">make a post that unknowingly heralds the impending chaos</a>.</p>

<p>Jibbles is playing on the Dragonflight Beta, a test version of the new expansion that a small group of players are invited to try out before the official launch in order to test the functionality of new systems and gameplay mechanics. Importantly, items earned on the beta <strong>cannot be kept when the beta closes</strong> and <strong>are not transferred to your main account</strong>. </p>

<p>Today, Jibbles is trying out the new race/class combination added in the Dragonflight Beta, the Dracthyr Evoker. After completing the introduction questline Jibbles finds himself flying through Pandaria and notices that the Sha of Anger is up. “<em>Why not?</em>” he thinks to himself, landing and quickly dispatching the boss that he outlevels by five expansions. </p>

<p><em>The unthinkable happens to Jibbles.</em></p>

<p><strong>He gets the mount.</strong></p>

<p>What would be a cause of boisterous celebration at any other time leaves a bittersweet ache in Jibbles’ chest. The cruel whims of RNJesus have decided to award him a mount dropped every 1 in 7,500 kills on a test account he will lose when the expansion launches in a few weeks. </p>

<p>Jibbles takes this painful irony in good spirits and posts about his horrible luck on the WoW subreddit where, amazingly, another user, <a href="/u/Bodehn">u/Bodehn</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/xbsvcj/oh_god_damn_it/">mentions that the same thing happened to her while testing her Dracthyr on the beta</a>.</p>

<p>The community shares a laugh in solidarity with these two players, and the astronomical luck (both good and bad) it must have taken for both of them to get the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent within a day of one another on a temporary server that will close within a month. </p>

<p>None among the posters or commenters consider that this could be anything more than a fluke. A freak accident that befell two unfortunate beta testers. Some commenters joke about how this is a prime example of why you should never kill a boss that drops a rare item on the beta. Others speculate that it would be funny if Blizzard made drop rates higher on the beta as a joke. The posts drift off the front page as posts inevitably do, replaced by news of new features and content and release dates in the ever-changing whirlwind of information and excitement that comes with an expansion on the horizon. Jibbles and Bodehn, and their astronomically bad luck, are all but forgotten. </p>

<h1>Part 3: Tuesday, November 15, 2022</h1>

<p><em>The timeline that follows is reconstructed based on the progression of information recorded in forum, reddit, discord, and WoWHead posts related to Dracthyr and The Sha of Anger over the course of the evening on Tuesday, November the 15th. Stories told from the perspective of a specific character are speculative retellings based on an accurate timeline of when and how community knowledge about the event developed, and are informed by my experience as a mount farmer of 12 years who has participated in the discovery of similar bugs/exploits over my time playing the game. All events not related to a specific hypothetical character are completely factual.</em>  </p>

<h3>It’s 6:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>After an extended maintenance lasting most of the day, phase 2 of the Dragonflight pre-patch has come online and is available to play on the live US/Oceanic servers (EU servers will not have access until tomorrow, as their maintenance is on Wednesday). With it comes the Dracthyr Evokers, available to players a few weeks ahead of the official expansion launch. </p>

<p>It takes about an hour to get a newly-created Dracthyr (who start at level 58) through the introductory questline and to the level cap of 60, at which point they are set loose to explore the world (of Warcraft) at their leisure.</p>

<h3>It’s 7:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>Dracthyr pour into the capital cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar en masse. Most unlock the ability to fly and head to kill elemental lords that have been added for a limited-time pre-patch event which also opened today. Others head to the city training dummies to test out their new class abilities. Others still begin flying to old raids and dungeons to farm armor sets that they think will look good on their new lizards. </p>

<p>We do not know how the event, ten years in the making and mere minutes away from its grand culmination, began. We do not know who first saw the Sha spawning in Kun-Lai Summit and decided to pause for a moment to try their luck. Perhaps it was a player in this last group, flying to some old raid in search of a staff or a pair of pauldrons. Perhaps it was one of those still camping the Sha weekly, hoping desperately for the mount and seeing their new Dracthyr as just another weekly 0.01% chance at the prize that has eluded them for so long. Perhaps it was even Jibbles or Bodehn, hoping in vain to relive their moment of glory. </p>

<p>We do not know how the event that is now at long last upon us began. </p>

<p>But we know what followed. </p>

<h3>It’s 7:20pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years. </p>

<p>The mount farmers, fewer tonight due to the multitudes that have taken a break to enjoy the pre-patch festivities, are given their standard gold and long-worthless pieces of armor. </p>

<p>But this first Dracthyr, who has killed the sha of anger for the first time, receives something different.</p>

<p>They have received the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.</p>

<p>Players take notice. It’s common to ride a new mount in celebration upon receiving it, and a character’s guild is automatically notified in the chat window when their guildmate receives an especially rare drop such as the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. At first the luck and humor of Blizzard’s new dragon race receiving this elusive dragon mount amuses those farming, offering the mix of curses and congratulations that so often follow a fellow player receiving a rare reward. </p>

<h3>It’s 7:35pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>A second Dracthyr, either encouraged by his comrade’s luck or simply making a quick pit-stop to try <em>their</em> hand at rolling the dice of fate, is among the masses who have beaten it down. Around them stand the mount farmers, many of whom were present at the kill which occurred at 7:20pm and have since switched to another alt for another 0.01% chance. </p>

<p>This Dracthyr, too, has received the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. </p>

<p>When bugs, especially beneficial ones, are discovered in World of Warcraft, the process is often more akin to the breaking of a dam than the flipping of a switch. In a game with as many random numbers as WoW it can be hard to differentiate what should be attributed to luck from what may be the result of something more. </p>

<p>But this is odd. </p>

<p>Mount farmers and guildmates alike have seen a Dracthyr get a mount that should drop once every 7,500 kills twice within the past hour, and each must have been the character’s first-ever attempt. </p>

<h3>It’s 7:50pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Five Dracthyr stand around it this time, and while not every one receives a dragon, two do. Oddly, none receive armor. </p>

<p>Calculating and estimating drop rates is something that almost becomes second nature to long-time WoW players. Knowing how likely you are to get a mount, pet, or piece of armor allows you to more efficiently decide how best your time in the game should be spent in order to reap the maximum number of rewards possible, or be the most likely to receive the specific reward you want. Dedicated mount farmers are especially adept at calculating these rates, as knowing your odds of receiving a mount allows you to estimate the average amount of farming time required to get your coveted prize. </p>

<p>The most accurate way to determine an item’s drop rate is to review data submitted by other players about whether or not they received the item after killing the boss. If 500 players kill a raid boss and 5 get a mount, it is likely that the boss has around a 1% chance of dropping that mount (assuming all players had equal odds to receive the item, as is <em>usually</em> the case with rare drops such as mounts). As with any statistical estimation, the larger your sample size is the more accurate your estimation will be. But while a sample size of two Dracthyr is too small to accurately estimate anything beyond the fact that something has gone wrong with the Sha of Anger, a sample size of five begins to afford a very rough idea of odds. </p>

<p>It <em>appears</em> that Dracthyr have a 40% chance of receiving the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. </p>

<h3>It’s 8:05pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Twenty Dracthyr stand around it. Six ride glowing black and white dragons. Once again, none have received armor. </p>

<p>Only six riders indicates that perhaps the drop rate for Dracthyr isn’t quite 40%, but with a sample size this small variations are bound to occur.</p>

<p>One player, an avid mount farmer who has hunted the Sha for years and is intimately familiar with the way its loot table operates (due to the bug that occurred ten years ago) has just realized what happened.</p>

<h3>Oops, all dragons! - <em>How Blizzard broke the Sha’s loot table (the second time)</em></h3>

<p>If you recall, the Sha of Anger’s loot table works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game internally rolls a random number ranging from 1 to 100. </p></li>
<li><p>If the game rolls a 1 to 59, the player receives gold and nothing else happens.</p></li>
<li><p>If the game rolls a 60 to 100, the player is marked as receiving a piece of loot, at which point the game rolls a SECOND random number to determine what piece of gear the player is awarded from a weighted loot table of class-specific armor (so that a rogue doesn’t accidentally get paladin armor, which they can’t use). The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is on this loot table as an incredibly low drop. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that each class has their own loot table in order to guarantee that each is able to use any armor awarded to them. </p>

<p><strong>What then, hypothetically, might happen if a class simply did not have a loot table?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>When <strong>that</strong> player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game would internally roll a random number ranging from 1 to 100. </p></li>
<li><p>If the game were to roll a 1 to 59, the player would receive gold as normal and nothing else would happen.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>It’s 9:35pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done much more quickly every 15 minutes for the past two hours.</p>

<p>A cloud of fourty Dracthyr riding fourty black and glowing white dragons rises from the corpse.</p>

<p>Another sixty Dracthyr sit down and begin a 20 second logout animation. Most of these Dracthyr have never sat before in their brief 65 minutes of existence. Many will never stand again. </p>

<p>News of the glitch has begun to spread like wildfire on private forums as players attempt to tell their friends of this unique opportunity to get one of the rarest mounts in the game. Most are careful to not announce the discovery <strong>too</strong> loudly or <strong>too</strong> publicly, knowing they likely have mere hours before Blizzard notices their mistake and rapidly corrects it, and the more openly they discuss what they’ve found, the sooner it is likely to be fixed. </p>

<p>The clock is ticking. Game breaking exploits like these tend to be fixed in hours, not days, and all know it will not last to the next loot reset occuring on November the 22nd, almost seven days away. A 40% chance is far higher than the typical 0.01%, but it’s not a guarantee, and while players can farm a coin that allows them to reroll for a second drop to improve their odds, many still find themselves among the unlucky few that do not walk away with a mount. These players know that if they want to benefit from this oversight, they need to do it <strong>now</strong>. But due to the high level that a Dracthyr starts at, the game prevents players from making more than one on any specific realm. </p>

<p>Unless of course.</p>

<p><em>You simply deleted them.</em></p>

<p>Hours after their painstaking creation and minutes after first stepping foot on the foreign soil of Pandaria, many of the Dracthyr unlucky enough to have not secured a mount for their player log out and are unceremoniously destroyed. Their deaths make way for the creation of new Dracthyr with, most importantly, new loot lockouts. No such time or consideration is taken in the creation of this second wave, a randomizer allows players to create their draconic cattle seconds faster, and those seconds could be the difference between making it to the Sha before Blizzard realizes and fixes their disastrous mistake. Where a few hours ago players leisurely explored the new introductory questline, taking in the sights and scenery so lovingly crafted by the developers, now a garish wave of blues and purples and whites and golds races through it with one unifying thought in their minds. </p>

<p>Escape.</p>

<h3>It’s 10:20pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, unceremoniously dispatched by waves of fire and a flurry of hundreds of flashing chromatic draconic fists within moments of its triumphant return. Many that felled the monstrosity are themselves dispatched mere seconds later in the midst of the resulting vortex of black and glowing white, having utterly failed in the singular purpose for which they were created. From the ashes of their destruction yet another generation of garish lizards rise and begin the 45 minute sprint to their own demise. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/hotfixed-sha-of-anger-and-nalak-loot-issues-with-evokers-mounts-are-the-only-329936#comments">Commenters report that Blizzard fixes the issue within minutes of this article being posted</a>.</p>

<h3>It’s 1:20am, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>Thousands of brightly colored Dracthyr who have just finished their most recent mad dash through the introductory questline are joined by thousands more that have just read the new WoWHead article. They kill the Sha of anger almost before he can finish speaking.</p>

<p>Each receives 38 gold.</p>

<h3>It’s November 16, 2022, 9:00am, Eastern Standard Time</h3>

<p>Players across the United States and Oceanic realms are waking up to the news, which is now being posted and discussed on all major sources of World of Warcraft information and discussion, that there was a window of time yesterday where one of the rarest, most prestigious mounts in the game was obtainable in a coin flip. <strong>And most of them missed it..</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, the World of Warcraft community is renowned in the gaming sphere for their capacity for level headed discussion and mature presentation of-I’m just kidding they lost their fucking minds.</p>

<p>In addition to frustrated US and OCE players who missed this bug, EU players, who had never even had the opportunity to attempt it because the error was fixed before their version of the pre-patch went live on Wednesday, weigh in. </p>

<p>Some amongst the playerbase see bugs like this (and their subsequent exploitation) as just another part of the game, especially on patch days, and are happy to see their fellow players get an opportunity to secure such a rare reward they otherwise wouldn’t have gotten.</p>

<p>A few people want Blizzard to go the other direction and give <strong>everyone</strong> the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Calls to have the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent be raised to a 1% chance (the normal drop chance for rare mounts) have been common for years, and with the player base debating how best to address this issue, many suggest it as a solution that would allow lucky Dracthyr to keep their mounts, but give other players a better chance to get a dragon of their own going forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”<em><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/hotfixed-sha-of-anger-and-nalak-loot-issues-with-evokers-mounts-are-the-only-329936?page=2#p5470794">Yeah, this is a good chance to fix it to be a 1% drop chance. It will still be rare but it wont be absurd</a></em>”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>However when bugs like this one have popped up in the past Blizzard has generally displayed a policy of quietly fixing them and not addressing the issue further, either with a public response or a rollback of the awarded items.

<p>(It’ doesn’t)</p>

<h3>It’s November 16, 2022, 10:00pm, Eastern Standard Time</h3>

<p>After a day of anger, bargaining, and depression (which is honestly hilarious when you remember this is about dressing up virtual paper dolls) the WoW community is moving towards a resigned acceptance that Blizzard will stay silent. The Dracthyr that were lucky enough to kill the Sha in time will keep their mounts, the drop rate will stay as abysmally-low as it’s always been, and the world (of Warcraft) will spin on. For many, the prepatch experience has been soured slightly by the feeling that they’ve just missed their chance to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. </p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>For the second time in as many days.</p>

<p>The unexpected happens.</p>

<p>Blizzard releases a list of hotfixes (small adjustments or bug fixes made to the game outside of a major patch) that went live a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Buried among them, with no other mention of the chaos that has occurred over the last 24 hours, is one sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<h2><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/drop-chances-for-mop-and-wod-world-boss-mounts-greatly-increased-329953">“The drop chances for Son of Galleon&#39;s Saddle, Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent, Reins of the Cobalt Primordial Direhorn, Reins of the Thundering Cobalt Cloud Serpent, and Solar Spirehawk have been greatly increased.”</a></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not clear what greatly increased means.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter.</p>

<h3>It’s 10:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Two hundred players of all classes (although there are probably a few more Dracthyr, since it never hurts to hope a little) stand around its body. Each waits for the second it takes for the game to assign loot with bated breath.</p>

<p>Two players receive the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.</p>

<p>The drop rate is ~1%.</p>

<p>After ten years spanning six expansions, the dream of the adventurers that first set foot on the shores of Pandaria so long ago are finally realized.</p>

<p><strong>The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is farmable.</strong> </p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>So what of your humble narrator? </p>

<p>Well, dear reader, it’s not a HobbyDrama post without a little personal investment on the part of the author. For you see <em>I</em> was one of those players that stormed the shores of Pandaria more than ten years ago in hope of securing a Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent of my own.</p>

<p>When the community finally determined just how rare the mount truly was, I gave up on farming it. Instead, like Jibbles or Bodehn or that first Dracthyr, I limited my attempts to the occasional pitstop on my travels. I racked up a few hundred kills between my alts this way over the past 10 years, but like a person buying a Powerball ticket when the pot gets large enough, I had never seen these kills as anything other than a fun shot at a mount I never actually expected to get.</p>

<p>I was among those who suggested blizzard raise the rates to 1% over the years, as I don’t think any reward in a game like WoW should be so rare as to make it unfarmable. But much like with my occasional Sha kill, I never expected these recommendations to bear any fruit. </p>

<p>I was not, sadly, among the garish waves of sacrificial drakes that felled the Sha on that fateful evening of November the 15th. I’d played for about an hour when the patch went live and leveled my Dracthyr through the starting area, but as those second and third Dracthyr were first discovering that something had gone wrong, I was logging off for the evening.</p>

<p>When I woke up the next morning to news that I’d missed a coin toss for a mount I’d wanted for the past decade. I was bummed that I’d missed my chance, but happy for the players that had been luckier than I had. Glitches like these (and the stories that come with them) are part of what make patches fun, and at the end of the day we’re all just trying to make our virtual little paper dolls look as cool as possible. I expected Blizzard would ignore this glitch now that it was fixed. “<em>Exploit early and often.</em>” is a saying in the WoW community for a reason, after all. </p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the news that Blizzard had raised the drop rates, even if we didn’t know what they were yet. Like any good researcher I knew the only way to find out our collective odds was to contribute by adding yet another player to the kill data that is so critical to have, so I logged onto my character, flew to Kun-Lai Summit, and waited. </p>

<h1>Wednesday, November 16, 2022</h1>

<h3>It’s 10:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.</h3>

<p>The Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>I stand among two hundred players of all classes, waiting for the second it takes for the game to assign loot with bated breath.</p>

<p>The loot window continues its animation for a half second longer than usual, telling me I’ve been awarded a piece of loot and the game is now rolling a second die to determine what I’ll receive from my class-specific table.</p>

<p>The window flashes to display the piece of loot that’s been selected for me. </p>
