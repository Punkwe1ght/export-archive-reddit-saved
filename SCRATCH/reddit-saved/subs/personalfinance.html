<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The credit score are probably the most oft-addressed topic in <a href="/r/personalfinance">/r/personalfinance</a>.  It shouldn&#39;t be.  Building a good credit score is simple.  A few simple truths you should keep in mind:</p>

<p><strong>Utilization is not worth worrying about.</strong>  It has no history, can be changed in a month, and isn&#39;t the biggest factor in your credit score anyways.  Stop worrying about it.</p>

<p><strong>Extending loans for the sake of improving your credit score is stupid.</strong>  Choose to extend a loan longer than you otherwise would to use your money more effectively (for example, if you have a very low interest loan you might want to make an IRA contribution instead where you hope to get higher returns), not because you think it will improve your credit score.  </p>

<p><strong>It doesn&#39;t matter what your credit score is if the rest of your finances are a mess.</strong>  Good credit scores come from sound finances, not the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s fine to leave unused accounts open as long as you aren&#39;t being charged.</strong>  This could include old credit cards, lines of credit from a bank, or whatever else.  Just make sure you verify you aren&#39;t being charged a fee to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Never carry a credit card balance.</strong>  Always pay your credit card bills in full, every month.  If you can&#39;t afford to pay off your credit card bill in full, that is a sign you cannot afford whatever it is you charged to it.</p>

<p>Everyone has lots more to worry about in life besides their credit score.  Focus on what&#39;s important in your financial life and a good credit score will follow.</p>

<p>I hope everyone has a Happy, debt-free holiday season.  Let&#39;s all make an effort in the new year to unwrap people from around FICO&#39;s little finger even just a little bit, shall we?</p>

<p>There appears to be a multitude of posts on <a href="/r/personalfinance">/r/personalfinance</a> about how individuals had unexpected bills because of a problem with their medical insurance or their medical practitioner. This post will cover the basics of health insurance, as is relevant for most consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>, like many other topics discussed in <a href="/r/personalfinance">/r/personalfinance</a>, your choices for healthcare are <em>personal</em>. The health insurance policy that&#39;s best for one individual may not be the best for someone else.</p>

<p>Also, I am far from being an expert in healthcare and it is likely that I made a mistake in this long post. I apologize in advance for any mistakes and would appreciate them being corrected.</p>

<h1>Health Insurance Vocabulary</h1>

<p>When looking at a health insurance policy, there are four numbers you really want to look at when you&#39;re comparing health insurance plans: The policy&#39;s <strong>premium</strong>, <strong>deductible</strong>, <strong>co-insurance</strong>, and <strong>out-of-pocket maximum</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>premium</em> is the cost of the insurance coverage. It can be billed weekly, monthly, or however often the insurance company/your employer decides. </p>

<p>The <em>deductible</em> is the amount that you pay out-of-pocket for medical services each year before insurance starts paying anything.</p>

<p><em>Co-insurance</em> is the percentage of medical costs that <strong>you</strong> pay after meeting the deductible.</p>

<p>A <em>co-pay</em> is a fixed amount that you pay for a service. You usually only pay co-pays for services not subject to the deductible.</p>

<p>The <em>out-of-pocket maximum</em> is the maximum you pay for medical expenses in the calendar year. Once the out-of-pocket maximum has been met, the insurance company will pay 100% of medical costs for the remainder of the year.</p>

<h1>An Illustrative Example</h1>

<p>Bob pays $500/month has an insurance policy with the following characteristics: A $2,000 deductible, 20% co-insurance, and an out-of-pocket max of $5,000.</p>

<p>In January, Bob got sick and had to visit the doctor. Because he hadn&#39;t yet met the deductible, Bob had to pay for $150 for the visit out of his own pocket.</p>

<p><em>Current Status</em>:</p>

<p><em>Deductible</em>: $150/$2,000</p>

<p><em>Out-of-pocket Maximum</em>: $150/$5,000</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, Bob had a heart attack and went to the emergency room. The bill for the hospitalization and the diagnostic exams came out to $2,850. From the bill of $2,850, Bob is required to pay $1,850 towards the deductible (he paid $150 for his earlier sick visit) and $200 (20% of the next $1,000) as co-insurance. Bob has now met his deductible and has paid $2,200 towards his out-of-pocket maximum. Bob&#39;s insurance company has paid $800 of Bob&#39;s medical expenses.</p>

<p><em>Current Status</em>:</p>

<p><em>Deductible</em>: $2,000/$2,000</p>

<p><em>Out-of-pocket Maximum</em>: $2,200/$5,000</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August, Bob needed emergency surgery and spent a week recovering in the hospital. The bill for the surgeon and hospital stay is roughly $30,000. Because Bob met his deductible, he is only required to pay the 20% co-insurance of $6,000. But Bob already paid $2,200 towards his out-of-pocket maximum of $5,000. So Bob only needs to pay $2,800 to meet his out-of-pocket maximum, and the insurance company pays the remaining $27,200. Bob is not having a good year.</p>

<p><em>Current Status</em>:</p>

<p><em>Deductible</em>: $2,000/$2,000</p>

<p><em>Out-of-pocket Maximum</em>: $5,000/$5,000</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disaster strikes again. In October, Bob breaks his leg and racks up another $10,000 in medical bills. Because Bob met his out-of-pocket maximum, he doesn&#39;t have to pay anything. Bob&#39;s health insurance pays the full $10,000.</p>

<p><em>Current Status</em>:</p>

<p><em>Deductible</em>: $2,000/$2,000</p>

<p><em>Out-of-pocket Maximum</em>: $5,000/$5,000</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of the year, <strong>Bob spent $6,000 for his health insurance and $5,000 on medical expenses for a total of $11,000. Bob&#39;s insurance company spent $38,000 ($800 + $27,200 + $10,000) on Bob&#39;s medical expenses</strong>. Bob&#39;s wallet is hurting, but at least he has something left in it.</p>

<p>Under the Affordable Care Act, medical insurance providers cannot put an annual or lifetime cap on how much they&#39;ll pay for expenses for <em>essential health benefits</em>. Essential health benefits include emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, and more.</p>

<h1>Negotiated Rates</h1>

<p>In the above example, having health insurance was financially an excellent move for Bob. For $11,000, he avoided paying $43,000 worth of medical bills. But most people don&#39;t have medical bills that exceed their out-of-pocket maximum. For those individuals, health insurance provides a secondary benefit called &quot;negotiated rates&quot;.</p>

<p>When you visit a medical practitioner or hospital, they can bill any amount they want (although some are limited by local laws). For some practitioners, the insurance company negotiates how much they&#39;ll pay them for that service. For example, a doctor may charge $200 for a sick visit. But the insurance company negotiates that they&#39;ll only pay $75 for a sick visit. The $200 bill sent by the doctor to the insurance company is called the <em>pre-negotiated rate</em>. The $75 bill in this instance is called the <em>negotiated rate</em>. An insured patient at an in-network practice will not need to pay more than the negotiated rate.</p>

<p>The medical practices that have a negotiated rate with your insurance company are considered to be <em>in-network</em>. The medical practitioners that did not agree to the discounted rates are considered to be <em>out-of-network</em>. An out-of-network medical provider can charge you the pre-negotiated rate. Taking the above example, the insurance company may only pay $75 for a $200 out-of-network sick visit, leaving the patient responsible for the $125 balance.</p>

<p>Additionally, insurance companies also may have different deductibles, co-insurance, and out-of-pocket maximums for in-network vs out-of-network visits. For example, the deductible may be $3,000 for in-network visits and $4,000 for out-of-network visits. It is usually most efficient financially to only use in-network providers.</p>

<h1>Fully-covered Services</h1>

<p>All ACA-compliant insurance policies fully cover well visits and preventative care at in-network providers. These include medical care like immunizations and checkups. That means that someone going for a regular check up does not have to pay anything for the visit, independent of whether or not the deductible was met.</p>

<p>For example, Alice has a health insurance policy with a $1,000 deductible. Alice is healthy and wants to stay that way, so she schedules a flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office. Even though it&#39;s January and Alice hasn&#39;t paid anything towards her deductible, her insurance policy completely covers the flu shot and Alice does not have to pay any part of the cost.</p>

<h1>Types of Insurance Policies</h1>

<p>(From the wiki: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance">https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)</strong>: HMO insurance plans generally have cheaper premiums than the other types of plans. The drawback is that they are also usually the most restrictive when it comes to selecting health care providers. Most HMO insurance plans also require a referral from your primary care physician (PCP) to see a specialist.</li>
<li><strong>EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization)</strong>: EPO insurance plans, like HMO, usually will only cover non-emergency medical costs from providers that are in-network. Referrals are not usually required in order to see specialists.</li>
<li><strong>POS (Point of Service)</strong>: POS insurance plans will usually cover medical costs both in- and out-of-network, though you will typically pay less at in-network providers. Referrals from a primary care provider may be required to see specialists.</li>
<li><strong>PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)</strong>: PPO insurance plans, like POS, cover medical costs both in- and out-of-network, with cheaper costs when staying in-network. A referral is usually not required to see specialists.</li>
</ul>

<p>HMO and PPO plans are the most common. Most health insurance plans can be compared by looking at the participating (in-network) providers, whether a referral from your physician is needed to see a specialist, the deductible and/or co-pays, and the out-of-pocket maximum.</p>

<p>Most of these options can be improved at the expense of increasing the premium. With all else being equal, a plan with a lower deductible will have a higher premium. Similarly, a plan with a lower out-of-pocket maximum or a larger provider network may also have a higher premium.</p>

<h1>Comparing Insurance Policies</h1>

<p>When considering insurance policies, you’ll want to verify that your doctors are all in-network and that you’ll be able to easily visit an in-network practice in the event of an emergency. <em>If you can’t use your health insurance to lower your medical bills, it doesn’t make a difference how low the premium is</em>.</p>

<p>When comparing healthcare policies, I’ve found it worth examining the minimum, expected, and maximum cost for each policy. The minimum cost would be for the premiums and any regular prescriptions and medical visits necessary. The maximum cost would be the sum of the premiums and out-of-pocket maximums. The expected cost would be the average amount you expect to spend on healthcare over a year, including the premiums and the cost of several sick visits.</p>

<p>The expected cost of an insurance policy can be affected by many factors. The larger your family, the more sick visits you&#39;ll likely have during the year. The expected illnesses and complications for a 25-year old are very different than those of a 55-year old. Another factor to consider is that if a family member has a chronic condition, your calculation for the expected cost could be very different. Likewise if you (or your wife) is pregnant and has been having minor complications, you can expect that you&#39;ll have many more doctor&#39;s visits than normal, and you&#39;ll need to evaluate the chance of the baby spending time in the NICU.</p>

<p>The expected cost of your health expenses is where health insurance becomes extremely personal.</p>

<h1>Lowering the Cost of Healthcare</h1>

<p>Healthcare expenses can be quite high, with deductibles of several thousand dollars and out-of-pocket maximums over ten thousand dollars. Luckily, the IRS allows people to sometimes lower the actual cost of healthcare expenses by paying for them pre-tax.</p>

<p>Some employers grant access to a <em>Healthcare Flexible Spending Account</em> (HCFSA, sometimes called FSA), where money is taken out of the employee’s paycheck pre-tax. Then, as the healthcare expenses are incurred, the employee submits the receipts to the HCFSA program, which then reimburses the expenses from the pre-tax allotment. Some HCFSA programs also supply a debit card which can be used to pay for eligible expenses.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues with HCFSAs is that the money allocated for them is “use-it or lose it”, meaning that only expenses incurred during the calendar year can be reimbursed from the HCFSAs. Any money left in HCFSA cannot be used in the following calendar year. While some companies allow carrying over up to $500, you’ll need to check your companies exact policy to determine what amount, if any, can be carried over to the following year.</p>

<p>For example, Joe allocated $2,000 for his HCFSA. Over the course of the year, Joe incurred $1,000 of medical expenses. Joe’s company’s HCFSA does not allow carrying over any funds in his HCFSA, so Joe loses the remaining $1,000 in the HCFSA.</p>

<p>Another option available is called a <em>Health Savings Account (HSA)</em>. If someone has an insurance policy classified as a <em>High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)</em>, they are allowed to open and fund an HSA. An HSA can be funded with pre-tax dollars, and unlike an FSA account, the balance is not forfeited at the end of the year. Any money left in the HSA at age 65 can be withdrawn without penalty, similar to a traditional 401(k).</p>

<h1>Preparing for Medical Treatment</h1>

<p>There are many stories of people being shocked with a bill for thousands of dollars. Below are the steps you can take to avoid owing (potentially) thousands of dollars.</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose an in-network practitioner. Verify that they’re in-network by calling your insurance company or checking your insurance company’s online directory. Many people have been told by a secretary that the practice is in-network and then learned otherwise. If you go out-of-network, you’ll likely have to pay the full charge for the service and will likely need to submit the bill to the insurance company yourself for reimbursement.</li>
<li>If a referral or preauthorization is needed, make sure the paperwork is squared away. You may receive an EOB for the upcoming procedures. If you don’t receive an EOB, call your insurance company to verify that all necessary paperwork went through.</li>
<li>After each visit, you should receive an explanation of benefits (EOB) with an itemized list of what the doctor billed for. If there is an unexpected or fraudulent item, contact the doctor’s office to clarify why that line is included on your bill. Health providers are required to provide an itemized bill. If the charge is fraudulent, contact your insurance company.</li>
<li>If you go to an out-of-network practice, keep a copy of the statement from the doctor’s office, in case you need to submit the claim to your insurance company yourself. Even if the secretary says they’ll submit the claim to your insurance for you, they may not - and you’ll be the one who has to foot the bill.</li>
<li>Once you determine how much is owed from a medical visit, submit the expense to your HCFSA for reimbursement.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Dental Insurance</h1>

<p>Dental insurance operates similarly to health insurance, with similar plan types, provider networks, deductibles, and co-pays. However, dental insurance policies <strong>can</strong> have an annual or lifetime maximum for services, as they are not legally required to offer unlimited benefits.</p>

<h1>Afterword</h1>

<p>Thanks for reading this massive wall of text (6 pages in the Google Doc I drafted it in). I hope you found it educational and understandable. If I omitted any important details, or worse, made a mistake, please let me and the other readers know!</p>

<p>Many details of health insurance were left out of this writeup. Some intentionally, many unintentionally. Below is a list of omissions for anyone interested in learning more:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preventative Care</strong>: Not all preventative care is fully covered by insurance. To quote <a href="/u/whynot19734">/u/whynot19734</a>: &quot;Make sure that when you schedule an appointment for one of these services, you confirm that it is a covered preventive benefit, and if you get charged afterward, appeal it with your insurer.&quot; (Thanks to <a href="/u/whynot19734">/u/whynot19734</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Years</strong>: The examples above assumed the health insurance&#39;s &quot;Policy year&quot; is the calendar year (Jan-Dec). Some employers use other 12-month periods. For example, a school might use use July-June instead. (Thanks to <a href="/u/108241">/u/108241</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Family vs Individual plans</strong>: Many people get a single health insurance plan to cover their entire family. Family plans often have a larger collective deductible and out-of-pocket maximum, but may also have individual deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. (Thanks to <a href="/u/GooDawg">/u/GooDawg</a> for pointing out this omission)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prescription drug tiers</strong>: Most insurance companies will have different copays for different medications. A drug on a higher tier may cost you much more than a functionally-equivalent drug on a lower tier. Generics will usually be on the lowest tier. It may be worth bringing your insurer&#39;s drug tier list to the doctor to make sure your prescriptions are covered. Your doctor may also be able to prescribe an equivalent drug on a lower tier. (Thanks to <a href="/u/CodexAnima">/u/CodexAnima</a> and <a href="/u/47Ronin">/u/47Ronin</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healthcare Exchange</strong>: Every state has a healthcare exchange where you can purchase a policy. You may be eligible for subsidies or tax credits if you purchase a plan through the exchange.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>COBRA</strong>: If you lose your job, you can keep the policy you had through your employer, but you have to pay the full premium (including what your employer previously paid) and an administrative fee (often around 2%).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Negotiating a cash discount</strong>: You can sometimes get a better rate on a medical procedure if you offer to pay cash, immediately. If you have a high enough deductible that you&#39;re confident you won&#39;t hit, this can sometimes  (Thanks to <a href="/u/slyedge">/u/slyedge</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Requesting Charity Care</strong>: Low-income patients may be able to request Charity Care: free or reduced-cost medical care. (Thanks to <a href="/u/ffxivthrowaway03">/u/ffxivthrowaway03</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fighting a medical bill</strong>:  There are many ways one can attempt to prevent large medical bills. You can try to get a discount by requesting charity care or negotiating a cash discount or no-interest payment plan. Someone can stay with the patient and keep records of what care and procedures were actually performed (there are plenty of stories of charges for procedures that never occurred). You can demand an itemized bill and possibly request procedure results to force the hospital to prove they were performed. If your insurer denies a claim, investigate why. It may be possible to obtain documentation proving that a procedure was medically necessary. Certain states (like NY) also have laws on how much out-of-network doctors and specialists can bill patients at an in-network facility. (Thanks to <a href="/u/brp">/u/brp</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Planning an emergency fund</strong>: In the event of an expensive medical emergency, you&#39;ll likely need to pay your deductible. You may also not be able to work. If possible, it&#39;s worth increasing your emergency fund to cover a significant portion (or all) of your deductible so a single medical emergency isn&#39;t guaranteed to force you into debt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dental insurance limitations</strong>: Dental insurance providers may not cover some procedures they deem cosmetic. Dental insurance plans may also require coverage for a duration (could even be a year) before providing benefits for major work like root canals or crowns. (Thanks <a href="/u/KingOfTheBongos87">/u/KingOfTheBongos87</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fee for not having health insurance</strong>: Anyone not covered by health insurance for more than two complete 2 months during a calendar year has to pay a fine. The fine for 2015 is 2% of the household income (up to a max of the average national Bronze plan) or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child under 18 (up to a max of $975), whichever is larger. The fine for 2016 is 2.5% of the household income (up to a max of the average national Bronze plan) or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child under 18 (up to a max of $2,085), whichever is larger.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit 1: Corrected math on annual premium, added section title for &quot;Comparing Insurance Policies&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 2: Expanded &quot;Comparing Insurance Policies&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 3: Added spacing in the example to make it more readable.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So you want to buy a house, eh?  Here&#39;s some information that can help with that pesky <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/down-payment-1.aspx">down payment</a>: how much do you need, and where should you get it?  This is for US audiences. and assumes you are buying a personal residence.  Note that this is intended as an overview, and doesn&#39;t cover every possible option or alternative available, especially locally to you or specific to your situation.  This writeup assumes  you are qualified for a loan in other ways, such as credit history.</p>

<p><strong>The basics.</strong>  Lenders want you to have your own money at risk in a house purchase, thus the down payment, which forms your initial equity.    20% of the price is a popular target; this gives the lender a cushion in the event they need to foreclose, since you will take the first 20% of the loss in foreclosure.  </p>

<p>Most <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/conventional-fha-va-mortgage.aspx">conventional</a> (i.e. non-government-backed) mortgages will require <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance-en-122/">Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</a> if you don&#39;t put 20% down; usually you need at least 5%, though.  That&#39;s not the end of the world, but it&#39;s an added cost to you, so we&#39;ll look at that shortly.  Note that there are some conventional mortgages with reduced / eliminated PMI, but they are limited to certain lenders or situations.  Most people won&#39;t have those options.   Since 2/3 of mortgages  are conventional, we&#39;ll spend more time discussing how down payments and PMI work for these type of loans.  </p>

<p>Alternatively,  the government guarantees other mortgage products, including FHA, VA and USDA loans, that have <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/4-mortgages-that-require-little-money-down-1.aspx">reduced down payment requirements</a>; the government assumes some of the risk, allowing a reduced down payment, and gets you to pay the rest of it in various ways.   You have to be a veteran for a  VA loan, and only certain ruralish locations are eligible for <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/usda-loan/">USDA loans</a> (and the best deals are for people with low income), but if those work for you, those are good options with 0% (!) down payment.   <a href="https://www.fha.com/fha_article?id=210">FHA loans</a> are more of a mixed blessing because you end up paying  their version of PMI, called <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/7570/fha-mip-cancel">MIP</a>; down payments on FHA mortgages start at 3.5%.  </p>

<p><strong>How much should you put down?</strong>  That&#39;s easy, right? 20%?  Well, maybe not.    The <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/daily-news/2017/02/15/big-down-payment-myth">average down payment</a> in 2016 was 11% across all types of mortgages, so plenty of conventional mortgages are written with less than 20% down.  You just pay extra through PMI for the privilege of the bank taking on more risk.  </p>

<p>You have three main ways of <a href="http://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/options-paying-private-mortgage-insurance/">paying PMI</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>As an added fee to your monthly payment, usually about .5% to 1% of the house price / year, paid monthly, but it varies based on down payment and credit score;</p></li>
<li><p>As a higher interest rate (perhaps .25% more) for the life of your loan, so-called lender-paid PMI (but you really pay it anyway);</p></li>
<li><p>As a one-time <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-single-payment-mortgage-insurance">lump sum</a>.  You pay something like 3% of the house price up front in lieu of monthly surcharges.  Unlike a down payment, this doesn&#39;t go towards your equity.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, you have options.  The monthly surcharge PMI can be <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/removing-private-mortgage-insurance.aspx">eliminated</a> once you pay down the principal of your loan to below 80% of your original purchase price.  That could take a while if you make minimum payments with a small down payment, but if your income grows, you could be in a position to eliminate PMI within a few years.  While paying down a mortgage isn&#39;t always the best use of money, paying enough to eliminate PMI is typically more rewarding and worth the effort.  </p>

<p>(Some mortgages also allow you to eliminate PMI if your house appreciates enough to make your equity 20%+, but that&#39;s not universal and will require you to do some work and pay some fees.)</p>

<p>The exact amount you put down depends on your specific situation; try for 20% if you can do it, since it will give you better financing options.   You will also pay less monthly with a larger down payment.  You probably won&#39;t get a better interest rate with a bigger down payment &gt; 20%, so that&#39;s not something to plan for.  </p>

<p><strong>Where should you get the money?</strong>  The down payment should be your money, so, ideally, you want to save up for this over time.   A typical nationwide house price might be $250,000, so 20% down would be $50,000; if you saved $1000/month, you could do that in about four years.   (And, yes, in many places houses cost much, much more.  Adjust accordingly.)   But, that&#39;s a lot of savings, and that&#39;s a long time.  So, what else can you do?</p>

<p><strong>Gifts</strong> from relatives are a very popular option, actually.  Lenders are used to these and like them.  There is typically no gift tax if your parents  give you $20,000 or even $50,000 as a down payment.  Problem solved, for those lucky enough to have this as an option.  Note that loans from relatives are not the same and not nearly as cool.  You will usually need to document that money from relatives is a gift and not a stealth loan.  If your relatives sell you their house for less than market value, this is also treated a down payment gift, a so-called <a href="https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/for-wiki-how-to-give-equity-as-a-gift.aspx">gift of equity</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special programs</strong> exist in certain places to give homebuyers, especially first-time buyers for some definition of first-time, some assistance with their down payment.  (Sometimes &quot;first-time&quot; just means &quot;didn&#39;t own a house recently.&quot;) You might not know about the <a href="https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/gnndabot">Good Neighbor Next Door</a> program that helps municipal employees in certain cities get a big discount on their homes.   That&#39;s an example of program you probably don&#39;t qualify for, but there could be something local to you that you do qualify for, e.g. in <a href="http://myohiohome.org/firsttimehomebuyer.aspx">Ohio</a> or <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/down-payment-assistance">Austin, TX</a> or various other places.  Look around at what&#39;s available in your state, and in cities near you.  Sometimes these are low-cost loans; other times they are grants, especially for low-income households.   Not everybody has these, though.  Many people don&#39;t have any good options here.  </p>

<p><strong>Retirement accounts</strong>  This is an option, but not an ideal one.  Most people retire one day, so that&#39;s a higher priority than buying a house.  If you are convinced you want to do this, your best options are either a <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/18789/should-you-borrow-from-your-401k-to-purchase-a-home-gina-pogol">401k loan</a>,  or a distribution from an IRA.   Roth contributions are the best way to do this not-so-good idea.  You can also tap IRA gains up to $10,000 without penalty once in a lifetime, but you may owe taxes on the money.</p>

<p><strong>Another loan</strong>  You can borrow part of your downpayment with a so-called <a href="https://mymortgageinsider.com/80-10-10-piggyback-mortgage/">piggyback loan</a>.  You still come up with part of the money yourself, but then borrow enough additional in a second mortgage to eliminate PMI.  You then have two loans to pay back.  It&#39;s an option, but not usually your best option.</p>

<p><strong>Where to save for your down payment?</strong>  Many people coming to this forum want to &quot;put their money to work&quot;, and especially for a house down payment.  But, sadly, your money is not very ambitious, and won&#39;t work very hard for you in typical down-payment-size amounts and timetables.   If you are saving for a house purchase within five years, you don&#39;t want to put your money at risk of a 20% stock market correction that will inevitably occur just before you need the money.   Your contributions will dominate any interest or earnings over a short timetable, so just use something that pays interest without principal risk.  (Unless you really do want to risk your down payment.  Most people don&#39;t.)</p>

<p>So there is some basic information about down payments.   If you have specific questions, let me know and I will try to answer them and update this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Buying a house incurs <a href="http://www.moving.com/tips/home-purchasing-closing-costs/">closing costs</a>, meaning costs that don&#39;t build equity, above and beyond your down payment.  Some are fixed fees, others depend on the loan value or house price.   While these vary by state, locality, lender and mortgage type, we can make general statements about US closing costs; these might be 2-5% of the purchase price.   The buyer usually pays most of these, but sometimes not; more about that later.  </p>

Here&#39;s a general example of closing costs in no particular location.

<p>That was probably confusing; it&#39;s a confusing topic.  To highlight key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many of these are  fees  for mandatory services.  You can choose who provides them in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Some fees such as taxes and recording fees are set by law.  They may also stipulate whether they are paid by buyer,  seller, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the big upfront fees like discount points or mortgage insurance costs are based on choices you make.</p></li>
<li><p>You would eventually pay prepaid costs anyway so that&#39;s not extra cost to you; you just pay them at closing.</p></li>
<li><p>Buyers don&#39;t pay broker fees in the vast majority of cases; those come from the seller&#39;s proceeds.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s a <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/closing-costs">calculator</a> you can use to get a more detailed breakdown for a specific scenario.  </p>

<p><strong>Managing these costs</strong>   What can you do to <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-to-reduce-closing-costs">minimize these costs</a>?  Let&#39;s first start with how to reduce the costs, and then see about how to get someone else to pay for them.  </p>

<p>You can shop around for many of these services, especially mortgage services.   Get estimates of origination fees and other charges to help you decide which of several lenders has the best overall cost package.  Negotiate reductions and credits by getting mortgage companies to compete for your business.  You can also shop around for title services,  you will save some time if you get your realtor or lender to help you first identify the companies that usually have the best rates.  </p>

<p>You can make choices to reduce your up-front costs as well.  For example, you may be offered the option to purchase discount points to reduce your mortgage rate.   That would increase your up-front costs.  In most cases, this is better for the lender than for you, but it depends on your specific situation.   You can also avoid escrow / prepayment if you put down 20% and get the lender to agree to this in advance.  In this case, you manage your own property tax and insurance payment.  </p>

<p><strong>Seller-paid (or lender-paid) closing costs</strong> </p>

<p>Getting someone else to <a href="http://usmortgagecalculator.org/what-are-sellers-concessions-and-why-do-they-matter-when-buying-a-home/">pay the closing costs</a> seems ideal for many  cash-challenged buyers.  Many buyers want to  avoid &quot;throwing money away&quot;, which is one way to describe closing costs. This can be easier said than done, however.</p>

<p>In seller&#39;s market, sellers have little motivation to help with closing costs via  concessions, so you won&#39;t get much help there.  In a buyer&#39;s market, you can write your offer to request that sellers provide a a fixed amount or percentage of the sale price back to you to help pay for closing costs.   Since that reduces seller proceeds, they may insist on higher sell price to compensate for this, and the house would have to appraise at this higher sale price.  </p>

<p>There are other variations on this theme where you roll some  closing costs into <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/11/how-to-finance-your-mortgage-closing-costs-71197/">amount financed</a> with the lender&#39;s assistance; this can also be done for FHA mortgage insurance fees and VA funding fees.   Rules for what is allowable are determined by lender regulations and government mortgage rules. 
 These tactics can let you buy a house for minimal up-front cash, but they reduce your equity and increase your payments, too.</p>

<p>So, the hope is this gives you an idea what to expect.  I&#39;ve purchased a number of houses in various states at circa $300K prices, and I&#39;ve typically paid something like $6000-8000 or so closing costs, without using discount points or seller concessions, but including prepaid escrow.  </p>

<p>Hope this helps!  Big credit to <a href="/u/bhfroh">/u/bhfroh</a> who provided  excellent input to this.   Questions welcomed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I feel the urge to buy something <em>right now</em>, I add it to my wishlist (or to CamelCamelCamel, which notifies me when it hits a certain low price threshold) instead and revisit it later.</p>

<p>I also budget my money at a very detailed level, allocating income as it comes in first to essential expenses each month, then to various saving goals and discretionary spending funds/categories. If I don&#39;t have money in a particular category to spend on something when I see/want it, I don&#39;t buy it. In the wishlist scenario, I might revisit it later when I can afford it, if it still is something I want. If I don&#39;t still want it when I revisit it, I remove it from the wishlist.</p>

<p>A side effect of budgeting like that is that I end up liking seeing the available money I have to spend in different categories grow, and while I am able to spend guilt-free in those categories when it&#39;s something I would actually value, I&#39;m more careful about impulse spending and consider whether I really want to put that hard-earned money to use in that manner.</p>

<h2>Free tax filing software program offered to anyone making <$64k.</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With tax season fast approaching I wanted to make everyone aware of a little-known fact that if you make less than $64,000 a year you are <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free">eligible for free tax filing and preparation</a>. </p>

<p>The government has a contract with tax prep companies like H&amp;R Block that allows for free tax filing for 70% of Americans. You can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the IRS&#39;s website. The program opens in January to file your 2017 tax returns.</p>

<p>The IRS&#39;s advertising budget for this program is $0 so very few people realize it exists. Last year only 2% of eligible taxpayers used this system. Most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they weren&#39;t aware of this great program. It is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free. </p>

<p><em>If you&#39;re interested in why companies would offer their products for free it&#39;s because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option. So long as tax companies offer free filing to 70% of US taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option, per the contract. They just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Use this program and please tell everyone you know so they can take advantage of it too.</strong></p>
