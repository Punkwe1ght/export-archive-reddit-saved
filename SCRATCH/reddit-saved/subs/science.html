<div class="md"><p>In addition to being a prolific scientist, I understand you&#39;re also quite religious. As both a Christian and somebody who has mapped the human genome and essentially proved/reaffirmed evolutionary theory, how do you reconcile your faith with all of your scientific knowledge? Does science have anything to do with influencing your beliefs or do keep them mentally separated? What will the future of scientific discovery bring for religious people?</p>

<p>I believe ProPublica&#39;s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-fall-of-the-cdc">Inside the fall of the CDC</a> merits getting added to the megathread.</p>

<p>Add:  Just my opinion, but I think that instead of - or in addition to -  linking to press coverage of journal editorials, the mods should link to coverage that contextualizes editorials&#39; content, which ProPublica’s article does.</p>
