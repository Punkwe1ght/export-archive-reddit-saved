<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I created this account for one reason: The default controls and camera settings in RDR2 can be real bad, but with tweaking you can make the game feel much, <strong>much</strong> better. These tweaks did a lot for me to get rid of the frustration I had moving the camera around, and finally getting rid of tapping X to sprint on foot in R* games.</p>

<p>Edit: I will be continually updating this guide. Latest update is on 10/30/2018.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Rid of Tapping X To Sprint:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to &#39;third person controls&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Change control scheme to &#39;Standard FPS&#39;.</strong> This moves sprint from X/A to the left control stick and crouching to X/A. Ironically &#39;Standard FPS&#39; is what makes moving in third person easier.</li>
<li><strong>Now go to &#39;Accessibility&#39;, go to &#39;Running Mode&#39; and change it to &#39;Toggle to Run&#39;.</strong> No more holding down a button to run.</li>
<li><strong>Now, instead of holding X to jog and mashing it to sprint, you click the stick once to jog, and click the stick twice to sprint.</strong> Click the stick while sprinting to go back into a jog, let off the stick a little and you go back to walking. After 17 years of having to master &#39;the claw&#39; in Rockstar games I can finally not have to do it.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Some other important recommendations to improve movement/camera controls:</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Third Person:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Turn &#39;Aim/Look Dead Zone&#39; all the way down.</strong> This makes the joysticks more responsive. This is why you feel input lag in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Crank &#39;Aim/Look Acceleration&#39; all the way up.</strong> <em>This will actually turn aim acceleration off, making moving the camera around much smoother.</em></li>
<li><strong>Crank &#39;Aim Sensitivity&#39; and &#39;Look Sensitivity&#39; very high.</strong> I like to have look sensitivity a notch or two below aim sensitivity. Aim sensitivity a 2-3 notches below max. From here just experiment with what works for you.</li>
<li>As for <strong>&#39;Aim Assist&#39;</strong>, I like to keep it one notch above 0. This one kinda depends on your play style. Following steps 1-3 should get rid of the need for aim assist, I like it because it makes the shootouts a little snappier.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>First Person:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Crank FOV all the way up.</em></strong> The default setting is like tunnel vision, all the way up is closer to a standard FPS.</li>
<li><strong>Copy over the third person controls to the first person controls,  including the &#39;Standard FPS&#39; control scheme.</strong> Cranking up the acceleration is especially key to making this mode feel 100% more intuitive.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Now To The &#39;Camera&#39; Menu:</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Disable auto-centering for third and first person cameras.</strong> By default, the camera &#39;corrects&#39; you from looking up or down too long once you let go of the stick. You may not of even noticed this, but your brain did. Disable this. (Thank you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SchwizzelKick66">SchwizzelKick66</a>)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Also Highly Recommended:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Go into first person when looting a house, or when indoors in general.</strong> Your default walking speed in first person is faster, and it makes aiming for specific items much less of a slog. It&#39;s also weirdly atmospheric and kind of awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>These settings made general movement through the world so much less sluggish and more responsive. I didn&#39;t feel like I was constantly fighting with the controls to have fun in the world.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wrap my head around why Rockstar made the decision to leave the controls as they were. Figuring out how to tweak the sprint settings felt like finding an easter egg the game was hiding from me. I don&#39;t get the feeling Rockstar would ever patch in tweaked movement controls like what happened with The Witcher 3, but I hope they do.</p>
