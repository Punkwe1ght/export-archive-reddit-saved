<p>If they push for me to disclose my range before they disclose theirs, I always shift my range up 40k. Wait several seconds to see what they say. Then I begin negotiating.</p>

<p>I almost always mention what GlassDoor has for the salary range for the role and indicate that I&#39;m confident in my abilities, so I <em>charge</em> more for my time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;ask&quot; for a salary, nor demand anything. I simply say that this is what I charge for my time.</p>

<p>I always mention that &quot;if you can&#39;t afford that, that&#39;s ok, I&#39;m not sure what kind of expertise you need, if you don&#39;t need an expert, then I&#39;m not the right fit anyway.&quot;</p>
