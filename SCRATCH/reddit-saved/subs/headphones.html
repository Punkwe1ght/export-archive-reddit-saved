<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just got my AKG K7XXs in the mail and have them hooked up to the ODAC + O2. I&#39;ve listened to a few songs that I&#39;m familiar with and have been able to visualize the position of the vocalist, but I haven&#39;t been able to separate individual instruments. I&#39;m looking for tracks where I can easily discern the positioning of sounds. I still haven&#39;t had that moment of clarity where I fully understand soundstage in practice. </p>

<p>Edit: thanks for the suggestions!! I&#39;ve got lots of listening to do in the morning!!</p>

    <p>That&#39;s when it hit me. A couple of weeks ago, I installed Windows 10, which means that Windows audio settings would be back to normal. </p>

<p>DACs often don&#39;t sound their best when the sound is pre-processed through Windows. IIRC some manufacturers are smart enough to put this in the manual. </p>

<p>You need to turn of Windows audio enhancements in the audio menu for the best quality. I personally find that it makes a big difference. </p>

<p>Steps: </p>

<p>-Right click on the speaker icon next to the clock. </p>

<p>-Open &quot;Playback Devices&quot; </p>

<p>-Right click on the DAC (USB or on-board) and select &quot;Properties&quot;</p>

<p>-Under the &quot;Enhancements&quot; tab, check &quot;Disable All Enhancements&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s not good enough to just have none of the enhancements checked, you get the best results with the &quot;Disable All Enhancements&quot; box checked!</p>

<p>Happy listening!</p>
