<button onclick="toggles(400)">View full post</button><div id="400" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw a documentary which includes a small segment on Gary McKinnon&#39;s hacking incident &amp; his &#39;Solar Warden&#39; discovery. The only thing I&#39;ve found regarding Solar Warden was an investigative journalist Darren Perks who tried to see what FOIA turned up . The email he recieved states: </p>

<p>&quot;About an hour ago I spoke to a NASA rep who confirmed this was their program and that it was terminated by the President. He also informed me that it was not a joint program with the DoD. The NASA rep informed me that you should be directed to the Johnson Space Center FOIA Manager.
I have ran your request through one of our space-related directorates and I’m waiting on one other division with the Command to respond back to me. I will contact you once I have a response from the other division. Did NASA refer you to us?&quot; </p>

<p>So at least the program existed at some point. For the record there has been a classified space program run under the USAF since the late 40s, Space force is not new. 
While trying to get approval to go forwars with Space Force at Peterson AFB , there was an active campaign to declassify the secret space programs by the General Counsel of the Air force &amp; Congress.<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/reagan-defense-forum/2019/12/08/barrett-rogers-plan-to-declassify-black-space-programs/">AIR force Barret -Cong Rogers to declassify SSP</a> </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to know the history. Gen Hap Arnold wrote a letter to individuals in the War Department, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, to discuss the need for a private organization to connect military planning with research and development decisions. 
Commanding General of the Army Air Force H. H. “Hap” Arnold articulated this need in a report to the Secretary of War: 
“During this war, the Army, Army Air Forces, and the Navy have made unprecedented use of scientific and industrial resources. The conclusion is inescapable that we have not yet established the balance necessary to insure the continuance of teamwork among the military, other government agencies, industry, and the universities. Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actual research and development work.” </p>

<p>Other key players involved in the formation of this new organization were Major General Curtis LeMay; General Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Plans; Edward Bowles of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, consultant to the Secretary of War; Donald Douglas, president of the Douglas Aircraft Company; Arthur Raymond, chief engineer at Douglas; and Franklin Collbohm, Raymond’s assistant. 
The name of the organization? RAND. </p>

<p>Like the Russians’ “doomsday machine” in Dr. Strangelove, RAND was to be a machine whose purpose was to fuel the fires of the cold war through research and development and inter-agency cooperation. The involvement of General Curtis LeMay in such a project is no surprise. It was LeMay who was responsible for promoting RAND as his own project. It is apparent that the Air Force seems to have played a major role in the birth of RAND and oversaw its operations in the early years.Its most visible contribution may be the doctrine of nuclear deterrence by mutually assured destruction (MAD), developed under the guidance of then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and based upon their work with game theory. Chief strategist Herman Kahn also posited the idea of a &quot;winnable&quot; nuclear exchange in his 1960 book On Thermonuclear WarRand’s wartime connections to the Army Air Corps and the Office of Strategic Services explains his close links to the CIA and Air Force intelligence, ATIC, after the war. His OSS secret mission, rescuing German scientists from Berlin in 1945, links him to Operation Paperclip and Allen Dulles. Later, Rand Development Corporation became a CIA proprietary. </p>

<p>-RAND Corp was responsible for most of the reverse engineering of the Roswell craft. <em>Made FFRDC in summer 1947, given govt funding with no govt oversight</em> </p>

<p>Starting in 1958 RAND research  begins on Mag Lev Tranplanetary trains -<a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P6092/">http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P6092/</a> tranplanetary </p>

<p>Also in 1958 they started research in  building USAF underground installations <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P4874.html">https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P4874.html</a> 
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM2617.html">https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM2617.html</a> </p>

<p>-Project sign was somehow placed under the purview of RAND CORP , as you&#39;ll see on the documents Lt Col Clingerman recommend RAND handle ALL UFO studies &amp; satellite projects be run through RAND. Maj Gen Craigie assigns missle expert Dr James Lipp to give an assessment. His findings were UFOs HAVE to be Interplanetary. </p>

<p>-Robertson Panel Dr Luis Alvarez was one of the 1st RAND Corp trustees. Shocker right? </p>

<p>Official documents <a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/12docs/USAFandNSecSpacePgm1946-1988.pdf">USAF &amp; Nat sec space program 1948-1988</a> which give the history of the military space programs in the country. The Navy &amp; USAF were the branches who presented a report to the secretary of War on these programs. Since 1948 the USAF has repeatedly refused an interservice space program. So in 1960s USAF top brass creates the NRO. The Aerospace Corporation was created in 1960 specifically for the purpose of USAF R&amp;D outside of the normal Congressional oversight making them responsible only to the USAF just like RAND. 
Here&#39;s an excerpt from A report from a scientist at Rand Armond Katz (<a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4357/1">https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4357/1</a>)
Katz recommended that the Air Force begin a “cloud reconnaissance satellite” as soon as possible. Katz suggested that the service specifically not call it a “weather satellite,” because an accurate title would create problems. “If we claim this is a weather or meteorological satellite,” he wrote, “various political and jurisdictional hackles at NASA and DoD and U.S. Weather Bureau levels will rise to the occasion. This we really don’t need. We feel that sleeping hackles should be left lying.” </p>

<p>The 1960s we have a program that involves groups of NRO/USAF astronauts who trained secretly alongside NASA astronauts. The very existence of these Astronauts &amp; the program itself was kept classified. (<a href="https://www.primidi.com/manned_orbiting_laboratory/history/mol_astronauts">https://www.primidi.com/manned_orbiting_laboratory/history/mol_astronauts</a>) This lines up with some whistlblowers claims of NASA only being a cover organization strictly to keep the  public satisfied. Meanwhile the real technology &amp; the important missions are conducted by these secret  military programs. Remember we didn&#39;t even know the fucking NRO existed for 30 years, don&#39;t tell me what secrets our govt can and cannot keep.
One thing I found interesting in Phil Corsos claims was Lt Gen Trudeau telling the House &amp; Senate that space should be under the USAF &amp; not a civilian organization like NASA. Though we know NASA is still controlled by the same entities &amp; has been caught in lie after lie earning the nickname &quot;Never a straight answer&quot;. The project Horizon documents show the early military interest in space activities &quot;There is a requirement for a manned military outpost on the 
moon. The lunar outpost is required to develop and protect potential United 
States interests on the moon; to develop techniques in moon-based surveil�lance of the earth r.nd space, in communications relay, and in operations 
on the surface of the moon; to serve as a base for exploration of the moon, 
for further exploration into space and for military operations on the moon 
if required; and to support scientific investigations on the moon. &quot; The 1961 Horizon doc were prepared &amp; stamped by Lt Gen Trudeau. I made a thread recently with much more info on this (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/y4pneb/usaf_the_ufo_coverup/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/y4pneb/usaf_the_ufo_coverup/</a>) </p>

<p>in fact there&#39;s at the very least Circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of a secret space fleet.   President Ronald Reagan&#39;s Diary entry for June 11, 1985,  reveals a space shuttle capacity that could launch 300 people into orbit. Also, on August 6, 2007, for example, NASA awarded the Human Spaceflight Support Team for assisting NASA vehicles in avoided space debris. The support team was part of USAF Space Command which is publicly stated to be the major military command providing space forces for U.S. Strategic Command. I remember reading about Reagans family and the private Showing of The movie E.T. Spielberg is recalls Reagan leaning over saying &quot;There aren&#39;t 6 people in this room who knows just how true this is &quot;. What makes this story more interesting is that the following morning,
Reagan was briefed on the U.S. Space Program. Initially meeting in the
highly secure White House Situation Room with Chief of Staff James
Baker, Attorney General Edwin Meese, and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael
Deaver, the four then met with six members of the National Security
Council (NSC) –<em>but no one from NASA</em> Grant Cameron noted NASA’s
absence from this kind of meeting as “unheard of.” It would seem that
NASA had become irrelevant to the true U.S. space program. 
Check this document from WikiLeaks on commercial space exploration <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/29/2946863_re-a-commercial-space-proposal-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/29/2946863_re-a-commercial-space-proposal-.html</a> from USAF Staff Sgt Kendra vessels. </p>

<p>Congress in 2016 passed legislation that Seems connected to he solar Warden space program that McKinnon described &#39;fleet to fleet transfers&#39;, etc.  (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr2262%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1">https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262?q={%22search%22%3A[%22\%22hr2262\%22%22]}&amp;resultIndex=1</a> ) look at these clauses. (2) discourage government barriers to the development of economically viable, safe, and stable industries for the exploration and utilization of space resources in manners consistent with the existing international obligations of the United States;
(3) promote the right of United States commercial entities to explore outer space and utilize space resources, in accordance with the existing international obligations of the United States, free from harmful interference… &quot; Discourage govt barriers&quot; what does that mean? </p>

<p>We&#39;ve had officials telling us about the existing deep state or cabal for decades. But we&#39;ve ignored the warnings of Pres Eisenhower  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EbFphX5zb8w">Senator on shadow government </a> </p>

<p>“Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. </p>

<p>“To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”— Theodore Roosevelt . We know that the CIA/MIC was heavily involved in the assassination of a sitting US president. The Claims of MIB appearing to silence UFO experiencers points to AFOSI. </p>

<p>What could be bought with The missing <a href="https://missingmoney.solari.com/dod-and-hud-missing-money-supporting-documentation/">$21 trillion DOD</a>?  Or the DOD failing EVERY  audit annually since the early 90s, or the SAPs going 6-7x over Budget and jus being swept under the rug. In fact, a J-2 The Director of the DIA recieved threats because he suggested he wanted to get to the bottom of this. Of course, Lockheed Martin owns our entire reality, whether or not we acknowledge it is irrelevant. </p>

<p>The fact that theres a seceet group thats been pushing through legislation to protect their illegal activities since the JANAP 146 of 1954 &amp; then the 
Is it not plausible to suggest that this whole disclosure movement began to uncover these truths Hidden from us for so long? Which was started by Maj Gen McCausland, head of the AFRL at WrightPat.Here (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/y4d06g/1994_special_access_program_overhaul_mentioned_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/y4d06g/1994_special_access_program_overhaul_mentioned_by/</a>) I linked the documentation that Adm Wilson describes was brought up during his meeting with the gatekeepers for the reverse engineering program at Lockheed Martin.  Yes, Hydra has taken over. But there are still some Patriots &amp; I think they are trying to get the truth out to the people. </p>

<p>Another person who&#39;s mentioned these secret space fleets is an aerospace engineer who was responsible for receiving the information packages from Navy spies in WW2 Germany. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/vrfn47/us_navy_documents_strengthen_william_tomkins/">William Tomkins- US Navy </a></p>

<p>CIA dir William Casey-“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.” </p>

<p>CIA Henry Kissinger “There are two kinds of realists; those who manipulate facts and those who create them. The West requires nothing so much as men able to create their own reality.”</p>
