<p>I just discovered them today and it blew my mind that in 2021 there are still pro-confederacy Facebook pages with such a large audience. They’re so gross and whitewash history it’s disgusting. They literally posted a old black guy with a Confederate flag today, as if all Black people love the Confederacy. Feel free to pay them a visit &amp; set the historical record straight.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a born &amp; bred Southern. Everyone of my ancestors fought for the Confederacy. I grew up believing the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; narrative that the South was righteous &amp; honorable. Disgusting, I know. When I got old enough to research it for myself I discovered how horrifying the Confederacy was. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHQU-HYetkoxFnCfbp5uRbjatZWqp3UoLGfs8V5LUjE/edit?usp=sharing">I actually made a short research presentation on just that if anyone wants to learn more.</a></p>
