<h2>A Guy’s Guide to Adding Volume to Improve Your Hairstyle</h2>

<p>Every day guys are bombarded with photos of Instagram models and clean-cut celebrities splashed everywhere with perfectly tamed locks – and we can’t help but admire their great texture, definition, and style.  <em>How do they get their hair like that?</em>  The secret to a lot of these hairstyles is <strong><em>VOLUME</em></strong>.  Volume is often time most overlooked aspect of the hairstyle, and often time plays the most important role in achieving these looks!  This post will provide some guidance on how you can get more volume and how it will transform the way you’ve always been styling your hair.</p>

<p><strong>Hair Type – Friend or Enemy</strong></p>

<p>Hair type can be the biggest friend or biggest enemy for achieving volume.  Everyone is born with a certain hair type and there’s very little you can do to change that.  But it’s the first thing to consider when it comes to adding volume to your hair.  Some guys have the luxury of having a ton of volume naturally, while others don’t.  Simply stated –</p>

<p><strong><em>Thick hair is your friend. Fine hair is your enemy.</em></strong></p>

<p>The advantage for guys with thicker hair is that they never had to worry about getting more volume…ever.  One issue that they typically have to deal with is volume reduction and control (but we’ll save that for another blog post).  Thicker hair has the natural tendency to stick up on its own due to the structure of the hair strand – the diameter of the hair shaft is larger than finer hair which gives it stiffness and strength.  This structure provides a natural lift and hinders the hair’s ability to bend over and lay flat. </p>

<p>Finer hair folk typically don’t have the luxury of natural volume due to the smaller diameter structure of the individual hair strands.  For shorter hairstyles, you might be able to achieve some volume naturally, but once hair gets to a medium or longer length you can forget about it.  Finer hair types at these lengths will likely experience hair collapsing under its own weight, leaving your hairstyle looking flat and lifeless.  Guys with finer hair definitely require more assistance with achieving volumes and there are plenty of tools available.</p>

<p><strong>Hair Dryer – Your New Best Friend</strong></p>

<p>Utilizing a hair dryer (or blow dryer if you prefer) to dry you hair can be a great tool for achieving volume without, or prior to applying, a styling product.  Typically hair dryers include a variety of temperature and airflow settings, including Low/Medium/High heat and Low/High air speed.  Choosing the right combination of heat and air movement will work extremely well to get your hair flowing in the right direction while providing lift to the hair.  As your hair dries it tends to stay in place naturally, and the force of the air movement will help “train” your go in the desired direction.  Hair dryer also have attachments like diffusers to better position and focus the air flow to get your hair flowing in just the right way.  (Note: It may be wise to use a heat-protectant spray prior to using a hair dryer to protect the hair from excess heat damage.)</p>

<p><strong>Hairbrush and Comb – Style and Form</strong></p>

<p>For some guys, applying heat with a hair dryer <strong><em>while brushing</em></strong> (using a comb/brush or simply finger-combing) is highly desirable.  This will encourage your hair to comply with the direction and shape that you want, while also distributing the hair’s essential oils, making the hair look shinier and healthier.  Depending on the brushing method/type used, you can make your hair form any way that you want.  The most basic method for achieving volume is to brush up and away from the forehead while blow drying. </p>

<p><strong>Pre-styling – Texture Powder</strong></p>

<p>The secret behind big volume and great texture may be hiding in a little bottle of white powder.  Texture Powder (or volumizing powder) looks very similar baby powder (or cocaine depending on your frame of reference) and works by <strong><em>adding extra grip between the hair strands to amp up the volume</em></strong>.  The main ingredient is likely silica silylate, which is an ultra-fine rough-shaped particulate that increases the friction between the hair.  Texture powder can be applied directly to the hair roots for an instant lift or all over your head – it really all depends on how much volume you are trying to achieve.  It’s a great product for pre-styling dry hair and the best part is that a little bit goes a long way!</p>

<p><strong>Normal Styling – Consider Lighter Weight Products</strong></p>

<p>Once your hair is “volumized” (using a combination of hair dryer, brushes, and pre-stylers), it’s time to form the hair into something more stylish and refined.  While heavier hair styling products with high hold, such as our Natural Beeswax Paste, might be a great option for finishing the style, it may not be that best option for guys with finer hair.  Lightweight hair styling products, like our Sculpting Clay, should be considered because they won’t weigh the hair down causing it to look flat.   We’d also throw high hold hair sprays into the mix because they are generally super light weight and will lock the volume into place. </p>

<p>We hope you find these guidelines to adding volume to your hair useful and that we opened your eyes to some new tools that you might have used or considered before.  Again, achieving volume can be done in a number of ways, but it’s important to understand that simply relying on one hair styling product isn’t always the best answer.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Welcome to MHA!</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome! I&#39;m <a href="/u/CaptainCannibal">/u/CaptainCannibal</a>, a relatively new moderator here hoping to improve MHA after hanging around it for so long. Today I&#39;ll be writing a quick guide that is meant to be short, simple, and easy to follow. This is meant for newcomers who are really not sure what they want to do with their hair and have not spent a lot of time being concerned with it in the past.</p>

<p>This guide is under construction. Suggestions and feedback are appreciated. Please keep in mind this guide is for total beginners who just stumbled across this sub and are wondering &quot;should I be caring about my hair?&quot;</p>

<h1>So uh.. why?</h1>

<p>Many men aren&#39;t that concerned about their hair and most men aren&#39;t concerned about it until they&#39;re in their 20&#39;s or so. Growing up, you&#39;ve probably not been told a whole lot about your hair or what to do with it. A lot of dudes end up looking like <a href="http://www.fashionfemale.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Blonde-Highlights-in-Brown-Hair-Men.jpg">this</a> or <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-q8lIbt5XB0/TJ6vGPITZcI/AAAAAAAAAL4/Qkyx6HXXEdM/s400/byron-hairdressing1.jpg">this</a> or maybe <a href="http://coolmenshairstyles.com/images/2010/09/tapered-haircut.jpg">this</a>. Sure, these dudes aren&#39;t ugly by any means but any man isn&#39;t reaching his full potential if he doesn&#39;t have a hairstyle that suits him.</p>

<p>If you still aren&#39;t sure that your hair is an enormous part of your appearance, just check out <a href="http://imgur.com/a/X0QO9">these awesome MHA user transformations</a>!</p>

<h1>Where do I start?</h1>

<p>You start with <strong>the haircut</strong>. You can have all the products in the world but it isn&#39;t going to make a difference if you&#39;ve got some sort of mop plopped on your head.</p>

<p>There are many cuts out there but it can be difficult finding a good variety. The best way to find haircuts is to check out an <strong>inspo album</strong>. Inspo is short in the fashion and hair communities for &quot;inspiration&quot;. These albums, in the context of MHA, are full of dudes with really nice haircuts. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/D8bLM">Here</a> is a quick inspo album I put together for newcomers. You can find another one at the bottom of this guide.</p>

<p>When you find something you like, <strong>take the damn picture to your barber/stylist</strong>. Trust me. No amount of you describing the cut to them will get you close to what you&#39;re actually wanting. A lot of people are intimidated by this but <em>so many people</em> take pictures in. It is completely normal to a stylist to be given a picture and told &quot;I really like this cut, can we do this?&quot; It makes life easier for the stylist and it makes you less nervous about them giving you something you don&#39;t want.</p>

<p>To reiterate, the answer to &quot;how do I get this cut?&quot; is <strong>TAKE THE PICTURE TO YOUR STYLIST</strong>. If you come here and ask what to tell your stylist to do in order to get a certain cut, the answer will be <strong>SHOW THEM THE PICTURE YOU JUST SHOWED US</strong>.</p>

<h1>Well I got home and it doesn&#39;t look anything like it did when they styled it at the shop</h1>

<p>This is because they likely used a product or two and maybe a blow dryer. Do you own a blow dryer? Does your wife, girlfriend, sister, mom, etc. own a blow dryer? If so, use one. A blow dryer is an incredibly valuable tool for those who like to style their hair. When your hair is wet it is malleable and as it dries it will be more likely to stay in whatever shape it dries in to. With a blow dryer and a brush (or your hands!) you can easily manipulate that drying process to do whatever you want. Whether that be to flatten your hair, blow the front back, spike up the top, etc. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/32d4eq/finally_invested_in_a_blow_dryer_check_out_the/">Here</a> is a great example of why it is worth buying one. There is also a great guide to adding volume <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3d5est/is_your_hair_lacking_volume/">right here</a> that talks more about blow drying.</p>

<p>So once you have your hair dry, you&#39;re likely going to want to add some products. I&#39;m sure you know what hair products are generally, but there are a lot of different types that do different things despite looking similar. We&#39;ll go over a few popular types real quick:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pomade</strong><br/>
Strong but pliable hold. Your hair won&#39;t fall in to your face all day long but you can easily tossle it around. Also makes your hair shinier. Great for slicked-back looks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clay</strong><br/>
A light product with strong hold. Tends to help with volume if you&#39;re looking for it since it won&#39;t weigh your hair down. Adds little to no shine. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gel</strong><br/>
Ridiculously strong hold. Adds a ton of shine. Most men are already familiar with hair gel - most people would recommend you stop being familiar with it. The only thing it is still good for is spiking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wax</strong><br/>
Waxes can be a lot of things, but the usual wax tends to be similar to pomade with a little less hold and a little less shine. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just some common ones you will or have already come across. It is recommended to experiment a little and see what you like best. You can also ask your stylist as they can assist you in finding something that works for your hair if you really aren&#39;t sure. Plus they&#39;ll probably jump at the chance to sell you some of the products they stock.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Finding a hair style that suits you is really important. It can definitely be a daunting task to take a chance and totally change a major feature like that, but it is so worth it in the end. </p>

<p>If you have any questions you can feel free to post them here, on the subreddit, or in one of the daily threads that are posted for specific topics. We will be happy to help you.</p>

<p>If you are interested enough that you&#39;d like to learn more about specific hair-related topics, just check out some guides below or on the sidebar to the right.</p>
