<button onclick="toggles(82)">View full post</button><div id="82" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently revisited a great text: <em>Theory and Methods in Political Science</em> (4th ed, 2018) by Vivien Lowndes, David Marsh, and Gerry Stoker. It&#39;s probably the greatest text on the subject and I cite it regularly in academic work. It&#39;s often included in essential reading lists these days, so certainly check it out if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

<p>I recommend reading David Sanders&#39; chapter on Behavioural Analysis. It&#39;s such a brilliant read if you just want some context to political science.</p>

<p>What other topics did you all enjoy studying along with political science?</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot a sociology, Gramsci is my intellectual crush</p>

<h2>Who are the most rational conservative commentators to read?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(254)">View full post</button><div id="254" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for some rational and thought-provoking conservative commentators to read. Not commentators like Ben Shapiro or those who used the word “woke” with no real definition. True conservative writers who can allow me to see another perspective since I lean left. </p>

<p>Does anyone come to mind?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
