<h2>Book recommendations request: modern guerrilla & insurgent warfare</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(222)">View full post</button><div id="222" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got some interest in modern guerrilla and insurgent warfare. I&#39;ve read a couple of books on it (most importantly <em>Nonstate Warfare: The Military Methods of Guerillas, Warlords, and Militias</em>), but not loads. I&#39;d be especially interested in syntheses looking at the logic of insurgent warfare, or specialist studies on anticolonial wars in 20th century Africa, communist insurgencies in 20th century Latin America (especially Nicaragua), and mainland southeast Asia (especially Vietnam). I would prefer clearly academically-oriented books over pop-history and journalism, but I&#39;m happy to take any recommendations! </p>

<p>Thank you. If this isn&#39;t the right place to ask this, please direct me to somewhere more appropriate!</p>
