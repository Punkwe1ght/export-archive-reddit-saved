<blockquote>
<p>“If you say we’ve been ‘found out’, what does that say about the work of opposition coaches for the last few years? Were they unable to see what our game is?”</p>

<p>Coaches who demand Klopp’s level of work and tactical discipline from their players don’t tend to last very long at any particular club. Think Guardiola, José Mourinho, Marcelo Bielsa, even Ralf Rangnick: wear and tear - physically, mentally and in terms of relationships - always become a problem before too long.</p>

<p>Each game is individually prepared for though and as Dortmund showed against Madrid a few years back they won’t press everybody. One of their pressing triggers was when Xabi Alonso got the ball. The main aim was to stop him dictating play and getting the ball in an area they could exploit. They ran out 4-0 winners.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Understanding his popularity is easy,” explains Lars Wallrodt, the chief football writer of Die Welt. “He has never changed. He is authentic. When you watch him coaching or talking to people, he is always himself. There is no mask, no pretence. He is the sort of guy you would drink beer with.”</p>
