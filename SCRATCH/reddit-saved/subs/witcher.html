<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p>

<p>few months ago Elder Geek (great  reviewer - not too well known though) made The Witcher Retrospective videos. It has 2 parts which total to about 30 minutes. It&#39;s definitely better than the usual 5-minute videos that lack many details. If there&#39;s anyone who needs to catch up - in detail - either on Witcher 1, Witcher 2 or both - this guy has them covered! </p>

<p>The Witcher Retrospective - Part 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqMr0OvQog">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqMr0OvQog</a></p>

<p>The Witcher Retrospective - Part 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSftIRQzYCM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSftIRQzYCM</a></p>

<p>Hope you&#39;ll like them!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In this list you&#39;ll find tips on combat, crafting, alchemy, character development and more. If you have any additional tip please leave the comment below.         </p>

<pre><code> **General Tips**       
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You can change the difficulty settings anytime – even during combat.<br/></li>
<li>Loot everything. You’ll need even the most useless-seeming stuff for alchemy and crafting.<br/></li>
<li>Don’t sell your starting armor. There is a way to turn them into better versions via crafting system. (thanks Emnel)<br/></li>
<li>Using the witcher senses will show you everything you can pick up in the vicinity.<br/></li>
<li>You can craft armor at the blacksmith/armorer. The level of mastery he possesses will define which armors he can craft.<br/></li>
<li>Weapons can be upgraded with runes, while armor is improved with glyphs. If you choose to dismantle item you will get some materials and rune / glyph out of your gear, and if you choose “remove upgrade” option you will destroy rune / glyph and keep the item.<br/></li>
<li>Alcohol is important – you can use it to recharge potions after you’ve used them.<br/></li>
<li>When you drink a lot of potions, keep an eye of your Toxicity. If the bar is full, you’ll start losing health.<br/></li>
<li>Make sure you always have a <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/witcher-3-monster-trophies/">monster trophy equipped</a>. They provide valuable bonuses at no cost.<br/></li>
<li>You can eat food to heal yourself. It&#39;s not as powerful as the potions, but it’s free and there’s lots of it.<br/></li>
<li>Some monsters only come out during the day, some during night time.<br/></li>
<li>When you pass near a point of interest, it will be marked on your map.<br/></li>
<li>Don&#39;t ignore <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/witcher-3-quests/">quests</a> or leave them for later – tackling the main story might trigger their disappearance.<br/></li>
<li>Visiting notice boards in towns will reveal nearby points of interest.<br/></li>
<li>Some objects can be destroyed with the Aard sign.<br/></li>
<li>Memorize the <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/controls-keyboard-commands/">controls</a>. The game will constantly remind you of them, but that won&#39;t do you any good in a tight spot.<br/></li>
<li>If you get caught while breaking the law, the guards will attack you, and they’re not ones to mess with. They’ll beat you up and take half of your money.<br/></li>
<li>Meditating will heal your wounds and replenish your potions, but it can’t be done in a bind. Meditating on the highest difficulty won&#39;t fill up your health bar though. Only foods and potions (thanks PayDrum)<br/></li>
<li>You can&#39;t rebind movement keys in the game, however you can <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/how-to-rebind-keys-in-witcher-3/">rebind the keys yourself</a> in The Witcher 3 file input.  (thanks Lindun)<br/></li>
<li><p>You can repair your items by visiting a blacksmith, or if you have repair tools, which you can purchase form some merchants.  (thanks ZarianPrime)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) Nekkers drops mutagens in white orchard. Its the only mob that I have encountered that drops it so early on before velen. (thanks luc424) </p></li>

<li><p>(new) Right before looting chests that reward you with relic weapon, save the game. The relic weapon item level will be different, you can load up several times to get highest item level. (thanks Grizzlywoods)  </p></li>
<li><p>(new) To mitigate a large chunk of your fall damage spam jump as you&#39;re about to hit the ground - you&#39;ll forward roll and take very little damage (thanks zezgotpwned)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) Horse Races &amp; Rewards - <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/horse-races/">http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/horse-races/</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>(new) If you are sprinting on foot; jump as your stamina nears zero. You will recharge stamina in mid air. Efficient running. (thanks Carsickness)  </p></li>

<pre><code>**Story Tips**       
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Listen to the dialogue carefully.<br/></li>
<li>Be mindful that your choices will often have consequences beyond the <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/witcher-3-quests/">quest</a> you&#39;re doing.<br/></li>
<li>If it sounds important, write it down – the previous game had quests that required you to perform rituals step-by-step from memory.<br/></li>
<li>Using the Axii sign on people will yield results, but it won’t make you any friends.<br/></li>
<li>Yellow dialogue options are the one that will advance the conversation – they can be mutually exclusive. Gray ones are just there for gathering information. Those colored in dark gray are the ones you’ve already chosen.<br/></li>
<li>There is sometimes a timer ticking down, rushing you to make a choice. Try to keep calm during these moments.<br/></li>
<li>Not everything is what it seems. Get used to the idea that people will lie to you.<br/></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/romance-guide/">Romance</a> is a big part of the game. Having sex with one character may change the way another treats you.     </p>

<p>&nbsp;  </p>

<p><strong>Healing Tips</strong></p></li>
<li><p>(new) Best healing method: Drink a swallow and immediately eat some food. The potion speeds up the healing process of food which adds vitality. You can eat 3 quick food items (5 sec) throughout swallows burn Time.  (thanks dominikson)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) While meditating, your potions will fill up if you have alcohol in the inventory.</p></li>
<li><p>(new) You can eat and drink at the same time for increased vitality regen. Example: Water + Wolf Liver will result in 2 buffs regenerating your health. (thanks JustAFlicker)</p>

<p>&nbsp;  </p>

<p><strong>Combat Tips</strong>       </p></li>
<li><p>Even if you don’t want to invest skill points into <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/signs-witcher-3-wild-hunt">signs</a>, use them whenever you can. A little fire damage is better than no fire damage.      </p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll do more damage while on a horse, but you need to keep an eye on its fear level.     </p></li>
<li><p>Oils and bombs are great, even if you aren’t upgrading your alchemy skills.     </p></li>
<li><p>Check opponents’ weaknesses in the bestiary. No matter what approach you choose, there will be at least one you can use.     </p></li>
<li><p>Try not to get surrounded or flanked.     </p></li>
<li><p>Keep moving all the time.     </p></li>
<li><p>Remember to dodge, but don’t be timid – the game rewards aggressive play with adrenaline, which increases damage.     </p></li>
<li><p>Watch the durability of your gear. Worn down armor provides little protection, and dull blades don’t cut very well.     </p></li>
<li><p>The crossbow can be used to ground flying enemies, but also to pick ground enemies from a distance. It has a much lower damage output than the swords, but it’s safer. You can also craft a variety of bolts for it – exploding, bleeding, tracking, knock-down.     </p></li>
<li><p>Use the environment whenever possible – the gasses in the swamp are highly flammable, for instance.   </p></li>
<li><p>holding down attack on horseback while looking at an enemy you&#39;re attacking will make the camera in slow motion, allowing you to hit your target easier (thanks koodeta) </p></li>
<li><p>You can Axii your horse to reduce its fear level (thanks fromplsnerf) </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/best-skills-to-invest-at-start/">Best Skills To Invest at start</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/best-starting-weapons/">Best Starting Weapons</a></p></li>
<li><p>(new) The crossbow one shot kills under water, but it doesn&#39;t kill all creatures (thanks MrOake)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) When fighting enemies on horseback, use Axii on the horse and it&#39;ll throw the rider off. When he&#39;s on the ground, you can instantly kill him with one attack. (thanks Hamish89)</p></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How To Make Money</strong>       </p></li>
<li><p>Doing secondary quests is a good way to get cash.     </p></li>
<li><p>Witcher contracts usually have a reward tied to them.     </p></li>
<li><p>Selling items you don’t use won’t make you a millionaire, but it adds up over time.     </p></li>
<li><p>Diving and sailing is a great way to discover Smuggler’s Caches, which contain treasures that can be sold, or money.     </p></li>
<li><p>Guarded treasures come with monsters attached. They’re worth the effort, though. The special items found inside can be sold for decent amounts of money.     </p></li>
<li><p>There are multiple currencies in The Witcher 3, but merchants only accept Crowns. You’ll have to trade the Orens and Florins you collect at Vivaldi’s Bank in Novigrad – it’s the building with the coin hanging above the door. - </p></li>
<li><p>Best paying merchant in the game <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/where-to-sell-monster-trophies-in-witcher-3/">Get full price for items from merchant</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>(new) Save your honey, and sell it only to the herbalist in the beginning area. She buys it for $18/each (3-4 times more then anyone else) (thanks Carsickness)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) Sell weapons and armour to weaponsmiths / armoursmiths, and the rest to merchants (they buy items at different rates).  (thanks Carsickness)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Character Development Tips</strong>       </p></li>
<li><p>Visit as many <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/witcher-3-place-of-power/">places of power</a> as you can – each of them will give you one ability point.     </p></li>
<li><p>Try not to invest only in one skill group – diversity is good, more abilities means more tools at your disposal. You can also test your build with <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/">Skill Calculator</a></p></li>
<li><p>One the other hand, one group will have to be your main group – there are only so many skill points to invest.     </p></li>
<li><p>Always try to pair <a href="http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/mutagens/">mutagens</a> with active skills, grouping them by color.     </p></li>
<li><p>Switch mutagens and active skills depending on the situation.     </p></li>
<li><p>General skills have greater benefits, but do not scale with mutagens.     </p></li>
<li><p>If you have a small number of active slots, it’s better to upgrade a skill you’re already using than to unlock a new one.     </p></li>
<li><p>If you see a merchant selling a Potion of Clearance, buy it. It’s uses to reallocate misspent skill points.     </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Travel Advice</strong>       </p></li>
<li><p>You can fast-travel to any signpost you’ve already visited, but the scenic route holds surprises and treasures.     </p></li>
<li><p>Do not pinch pennies on horse equipment – you need a fast and reliable mount.     </p></li>
<li><p>Sirens and other sea creatures can damage and sink your boat.     </p></li>
<li><p>If you make the horse gallop, it will follow the road automatically.     </p></li>
<li><p>You can mark quests in your journal, and the game will show you a quest marker and the quickest way to get there.     </p></li>
<li><p>If your not near a sign post to fast travel but near the edge of the map, keeping walking in the direction when Geralt says the map is ending and it will bring the map up and let you fast travel without needing a signpost. (thanks slasherjpc)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) To avoid randomly falling off ledges and taking the massive fall damage this game hands out, travel by horseback while exploring, it will stop at ledges, but still allows you to choose to jump, you will also take less fall damage from certain jumps (thanks hobosaynobo)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) When you are riding Roach, your horse, on a road, it will not deplete stamina, even if you are galloping (thanks HollisFenner)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) You know how you can hold down the sprint button while on horseback to make it follow a path automatically? Well, it will also make it replenish its stamina. Inmensely useful in horse races as you will be able to sprint full speed while gaining stamina back.  (thanks Sergnb)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) While auto-galloping along a road, if you come to a fork, you can use your mouse to choose which fork to take by shifting the mouse left/right. (thanks BenAdaephonDelat)</p></li>
<li><p>(new) How to use boat? Go to back of the boat and take the helm. Press and hold the run/sprint button. (thanks Willard_Billard)</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(According to the youtube comments, PC players seem to be having issues getting the shells to appear in the NPC&#39;s inventory! Comments here seem to indicate the same thing! Sorry for the title confusion; I was sure this method would work for all platforms.) =(</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/702760-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/71837668/821289252">http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/702760-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/71837668/821289252</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Novigrad, center of the city, where you witness two men on fire as you enter the Square, there is a merchant, his first two items are Shells, buy them all, very cheap, exit the sell menu to the dialogue menu with him, re enter sell menu, his stock is refreshed. </p>

<p>Buy tons, when you have enough, exit, go to blacksmith, also in an alcove in that square, go to dismantle tab in menu, break down Shells for Pearls and Black Pearls, sell as many as possible to blacksmith, exit, meditate for 7 days after you move to center of square away from blacksmith, go back after 7 days, sell more pearls.</p>

<p>I got 7k off two trips. That&#39;s all I want. Your welcome. (LOOK AT EDIT #3 for FASTER PEARL SELLING)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some notes: sometimes the merchant he describes doesn&#39;t sell shells: I can confirm that if you meditate (I waited 7 days), his stock will refresh and he will probably be selling shells. Another possibility is that his stock might be randomized with the other three or so merchants in the square (they may or may not have icons on the mini-map), so it&#39;s best to give all of them a looksie if the one described isn&#39;t selling shells.</p>

<p>edit: youtube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sR98XRDTYc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sR98XRDTYc</a></p>

<p>edit #2: It seems that the NPC on the PC version of the game doesn&#39;t offer seashells at all. I&#39;m just going off the Youtuber&#39;s comments on his video; I may be wrong. However that would explain why those on PC can&#39;t find the seashells. :( </p>

<p>edit #3: thanks to <a href="/u/asvpcali">/u/asvpcali</a>, i&#39;m adding the additional tip that you can sell your pearls to the Loan Shark shopkeeper in Novigrad much faster (backing out of the merchant screen refreshes his stock AND his gold.)

<p>If you&#39;d rather do something more casual or laid back, you can always farm cow hide off infinitely-respawning cows in the starting area. You can get ~40 orens per hide if you sell to the innkeeper in the same town (assuming you haven&#39;t gone to Vizima yet). Otherwise you&#39;ll have to sell them for ~25 orens instead (which is still a bunch):</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey dudes!</p>

<p><strong>Here is what you need to do.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>First of all you need to be in the White Orchard zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the ransacked village and look for the tallest building (looks like a fort) and then climb up there.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside the fort you will find the Serpentine&#39;s steel sword diagram and a book that starts the quest: Scavenger Hunt - Viper School Gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Now follow the quest directions of that quest. This will take you to a catacomb.</p></li>
<li><p>Go inside the Catacomb, loot the corpse and get out. You now have both diagrams for the swords.</p></li>
<li><p>The last step is to craft these swords. To do that go to any blacksmith (I went to the Nilfgaardian camp) and have the swords forged. If you need emerald dust, you may need to kill some more Wraiths. Alternatively they can be bought from the vendor for 500 orens.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To give you guys a better idea of what I am talking about, I have made a short video-guide for this as well. In the video you can see the swords and their stats as well. The video can be found here:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBWBAsKGpKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBWBAsKGpKQ</a></p>

<p>a collaboration between <a href="/u/AONomad">/u/AONomad</a> and <a href="/u/Schwadralla">/u/Schwadralla</a></p>

<p>––––</p>

<p>Are you new to the Witcher games, or have you only played sword and sign builds before? Were you hoping to play with a heavy focus on alchemy, but found it confusing, not worth the trouble, or not strong enough for what you expected?</p>

<p>Then this guide is for you. You’ll be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>deal heavy physical damage consistently</li>
<li>significantly improve your sign intensity </li>
<li>reduce your sign cooldown to the point where you can all but chain cast</li>
<li>blow mobs to bits with more bombs than you know what to do with</li>
<li>have insane amounts of health</li>
<li>heal yourself extensively</li>
</ul>

<p>. . . ALL AT THE SAME TIME. That’s right. You can do all of the above, at the same time, in every fight. So what are you waiting for? Respec into Alchemy!</p>

<p><strong>1. The start</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to one of the best experiences you can get from the different builds out there. You can call yourself a <em>“bomb throwing poison junky who has different drugs”</em> machine at the end of the skilltree. </p>

<p>How’s that?</p>

<p>This guide focus on using bombs, oil and potions to do so much damage in a short time that you will start calling this build OP.
You will have an answer to every enemy who exists in the world. And if he is still alive after your bombing attack you can fall back to your sword with the applied poison oil and upgrade your damage output heavily with potions.</p>

<p>We have your interest now? Perfect! </p>

<p><strong>1.1 Our experience</strong></p>

<p>We are playing on Death March, the hardest difficult out there. We did a lot of research and brainstorming about how to start and what is the “easiest” way to survive. 
It’s normal to die a lot at the beginning, because you need to get used to this different playstyle. It is not a hack and slash anymore, it is more about how to think about a good strategy how to beat some bosses or even groups of monsters. </p>

<p>And because we are playing on Death March, we are getting less experience than on other difficulties. Our health will not refill when we meditate and the enemy will be more aggressive. </p>

<p>You need to learn the movements of your foe, reading the bestiary and learning how to dodge (not to roll away!) helps a lot.
If you have trouble and get damaged a lot Quen will be your best friend at the beginning. </p>

<p>When you are getting higher in terms of levels and your knowledge about the different monsters out there, you are on a good way to be a real machine later on.</p>

<p>Before we are get into the skilling, a little tip: take every food item you find - don’t leave them (especially on Blood and Broken Bones &amp; Death March). You get health regen for free out of them, use it - Geralt won’t get fat.</p>

<p><strong>2. The potions</strong></p>

<p>One of the core elements are our potions in this guide. You will use them a lot and often different types of them. Another benefit of using them is to get health back with every use. 
In this chapter, the main benefits of potions are explained.</p>

<p>You have access to attack, defense and utility potions. Thus, any potential enemy or problem is covered with different potions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need attack damage? Drink a <em>Thunderbolt</em>!</p>

<p>You are poisoned? Drink a <em>Golden Oriole</em>!</p>

<p>You don’t see anything? Use a <em>Cat</em>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is recommended to use them every time if they are needed. You will lose nothing when you are using it but you will lose when you aren’t using them. When you are out of potions, meditate. You need a strong alcohol (like alcoholest) and everything is filled up.</p>

<p>Maybe you are asking yourself how is this manageable to take different potions if you can only quickslot two of them. The answer is really easy but a little bit annoying (hoping for a mod to fix it). While in a fight you can go into your inventory and drink any other available potion. You can change your quickslot while in combat too! The potion will work as intended. 
If you know what type of enemy you are facing, you can use the potion before the fight starts and quickslot some utility potions (like Swallow or Blizzard). So you are buffed up and have some life insurance in your back pocket. </p>

<p><em>Swallow</em> will be your best friend at the beginning. The health regen is useful in any way and you are nearly full life all the fight long. It lasts only 20 seconds but that is the time without the + % duration bonus time. This time will be buffed to 80 seconds at the end. And 80 seconds..hell..that is a lot of time for one use!</p>

<p>We mentioned at the beginning that you can get health back with every use. There is a skill called <em>“Refreshment”</em> and his effect is <em>Each potion heals 25% of max Vitality (on level 5/5)</em>. 25% instant healing with every use of one potion is OP. When you’re at the point where you have enough potions available, you won’t need any food anymore! Just drink a few potions and you are full life again. When you maxed out this skill you don’t need to fall back on <em>Swallow</em> anymore. Instead use a better fight impact potion like <em>Thunderbolt</em> or <em>Blizzard</em> in your Quickslots. </p>

<p>And the fun part is, that you do not even look at your toxicity bar because of our little skill-friend called <em>“Acquired Tolerance”</em>. <em>On level 3/3 the effect is Every known level 3 alchemical recipe, increases maximum toxicity by 1</em>. With all recipes known it feels like an never ending toxicity bar. <strong>In this case -&gt; Potion spamming is possible!</strong></p>

<p>The best at the end: with the skill <em>&quot;Side Effects&quot;</em> on max level (5/5) <em>you have a 100% chance to get another random potion effect without additional toxicity cost when you use a potion</em>. It sounds incredible, right? It is incredible. Your effect bar is filled up in a few seconds with a lot of different effects. You can call yourself a junky at this time. </p>

<p>In summary, you can get so much buffed that you have a <strong>high damage output</strong>, have a <strong>great defense strategy</strong> and run nearly <strong>full life all the day too</strong>. And that is just the beginning. </p>

<p><strong>2.2 Decoctions</strong> </p>

<p>Decoctions are different to normal potions. They are hard to create (they need special monster mutagens) and have a higher toxicity rate as normal potions.
So whats the deal with them? Because they are so hard to get, they have special effects which are active for long time (30 minutes and more with duration time bonus - Skill: <em>Adaptation</em>). </p>

<p>They give you effects like “Provides immunity to <em>&quot;Knockdown, Hypnosis, Stun, and Blindness”</em>, <em>“damage dealt to foes regenerates vitality&quot;</em> or <em>“each enemy killed increases max vitality”</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not want to write down the name of the decoctions because they are a little bit spoilerish (they named after the different monster out there). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because these are so special and add a lot of toxicity you should not spam them and use them wisely. If i know what enemy (especially Boss) i will face and have information about it (like he can stun me) i can use the decoctions to give myself an edge.. </p>

<p>Their use is absolutely optional but i recommend it later on, because they have strong and great effects. To get more power out of them you can upgrade the skill <em>“Tissue Transmutation”</em> or <em>“Adaptation”</em>. The first one give you <em>+600 hp for the duration of the effect</em>, and the second one <em>increases the duration time of decoctions</em> - both are maxed out (5/5). So you get more health for a really really long time. </p>

<p><strong>3. Bombs</strong></p>

<p>Our main damage source are the bombs. And we need to say it up front..they’re great and make our life easier. </p>

<p>Because we are facing a lot of groups of enemies, especially in the wild, the bombs are our way to go and make our life easy. You throw a few of them at the beginning into a group of 5 drowners after the detonations are all dead or one of them is playing Last Man Standing. </p>

<p>It is the same as the potions, there a lot of different bombs in the game available. Some of them are for <strong>damaging</strong>, <strong>disabling</strong> or <strong>anti-transforming</strong>. So is every different potential case covered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are against a group of humans? Let the <em>Dancing Star</em> out!</p>

<p>There are too many enemies at one time attacking you? Freeze them with the <em>Northern Wind</em>!</p>

<p>You are facing a werewolf? Stop the healing with <em>Moon Dust</em>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are facing a mob group of three or more start throwing your bombs! The best time is at the beginning when they are not in front of your face. Show them that you have so much power in your pocket that you only in the worst case scenario need a few sword attacks to destroy them completely. </p>

<p>When you meditate, the bombs will be refilled too.</p>

<p>When you are surrounded of enemies try to go out there (roll out) and throw a few bombs, if you can’t go out and you have a quen sign currently active, throw a bomb in front of you. You take no damage and the enemies are stunned for a short time. </p>

<p>A neat skill helps us a lot to aim and throw into the right direction. It is called <em>“Steady Aim”</em> and its effect is <em>“Time is slowed a further 45% while aiming bombs”</em>. It is obvious why we are learning this skill. More time to throw means it’s easier to land a perfect hit – the best result is always great to have!</p>

<p>We mentioned the disabling and anti-transforming bombs. These types of bombs usually do no damage. Their effect is great and have a huge impact already, but we want to have damage out of every source available. For this purpose, the skill named <em>“Pyrotechnics”</em> helps us. <em>It adds at max level (5/5) 150 damage to bombs that usually do no damage.</em> I know, 150 damage is nothing later on, but a nice to have, especially at the low level section. </p>

<p>How can we throw bombs so often are you asking? We know, there are only two slots for them in the quickmenu and only 2 bombs of each available at the beginning. To fix this issue we need to upgrade our bombs into better versions (we need to find or buy the recipes) or we learn the skill called <em>“Efficiency”</em> which <em>increases the maximum number of Bombs in each slot by 5</em> (on maxed level 5/5). So we have at least a minimum of seven bombs available. Thats enough to damage anything considerably. </p>

<p><strong><em>Attention: We take no responsibility for any damage that happens to you!</em></strong></p>

<p>Last but not least the ultimative psycho skill who is available to us. Did you ever  want to see some arms, legs or even heads flying towards your screen? Yes? In that case the skill <em>“Cluster Bombs”</em> is your choice for sure. The name says everything, y<em>our bomb will transform into a cluster bomb and upon detonation it separate into explosive fragments</em>. On max level (5/5) you have six fragments who are flying through your foes. You can experience some traumatic events because of this spectacle. On a serious note, this skill is great. It is doing additional area damage to the surrounding enemies and it looks really cool!</p>

<p>Just watch this .gif - <a href="https://gfycat.com/RegalIncredibleIrrawaddydolphin">Example</a> (thanks <a href="/u/_Griggs_">/u/_Griggs_</a>)</p>

<p>To sum up, bombs are <strong>your main damage source</strong>. You will have <strong>enough power to kill a group of enemies without your sword</strong> or <strong>reduce their health by a lot</strong>. Later on you can see some body parts flying around. The number of each bomb is enough to do anything you want. </p>

<p><strong>4. Oil</strong></p>

<p>If we really need our swords (especially at boss fights) we can boost our damage against special types of monsters with oil. </p>

<p>Every enemy is sorted into different types of creatures in the bestiary. There can you gain information about your foe and what the best oil to face him. If you apply the oil on your sword you will do more damage against this special type of monster. </p>

<p>The skill <em>“Poisoned Blades”</em> has the effect on max level (5/5) that <em>“Oil applied to the blades</em> <em>gives a 25% chance of poisoning the target on each hit.</em>” And because poison is doing a specific %-damage of the max health of the enemy is this skill amazing. If the foe got poisoned you can watch how fast the health bar is shrinking. </p>

<p>Another good skill to learn would be* “Fixative”<em>. On max level (3/3) *you have a 100% doubled charges for your oils</em>. so you have a good amount of time with a buffed damage output.</p>

<p>Oil gives you a <strong>nice cheap</strong> and <strong>fast damage output against a specific monster type</strong>. Against boss monsters or just strong monsters, this effect always nice to have.</p>

<p><strong>5. Skilling order</strong></p>

<p>When you are going a <em>full alchemy build you have 12 alchemy skills active at the same time.</em> When you are not going with the decoctions or oil and don’t want to buff them, you will have at <em>least 9 skills active at the same time.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To unlock the second tier you need 8 points in the alchemy tree. </p>

<p>For the third tier 20 points. </p>

<p>And for the last tier you need 28 points. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When are you playing on Blood and Broken Bones or Death March it is a great advice to put your first skill point into Sun and Stars. It regenerates 10 health points every 10 seconds when not in combat (during the day). The night effect is not effective for our build. You won’t be available to heal yourself with popping potions yet and food is always really rare. [If you are not playing on these difficulties you can skip this and start with level 2].</p>

<p>I mentioned it before, the early levels are tough but beatable. Learn to dodge and how your enemy moves. </p>

<p>The second available skillpoint goes directly into our alchemy tree.
For the better overview i do just an enumeration what to level up on what skillpoint</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Skillpoint</th>
<th>Skillname</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>2-6</td>
<td>Poisoned Blades (1/5) up to (5/5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Unlocked Tier 3</strong> - 22-26</td>
<td>Delayed Recovery (1/5) up to (5/5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>27-31</td>
<td>Efficiency (1/5) up to (5/5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unlocked Tier 4</strong> - 32-36</td>
<td>Side Effects (1/5) up to (5/5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37-41</td>
<td>Cluster Bombs (1/5) up to (5/5)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In conclusion we have a build like this:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/9knN4GN.png">Imgur</a></p>

<p>It needs 9 skill slots and have a <strong><em>additional duration bonus time for potions at +195%</em></strong>. 
You boost your health with large green mutagens <strong><em>up to +1200 HP</em></strong>. </p>

<p>The last three skills are your decision. You can focus a little bit more on decoctions or the oil for your swords.</p>

<p>This combination worked great for us and we are having not really much trouble anymore. </p>

<p>We both hope that this little guide helps you and that somebody is now thinking about an alchemy build!</p>

<p>Feel free to ask us questions and share your opinion!</p>

<p>Thanks for your read!</p>

<p>Edit 1: Thank you for the gold and all the kind words of you! It makes me really really happy that this helped you :)</p>

<p>Edit 2: I added a .gif into the <em>Bomb-Section</em> - it shows you exactly what i mean. Maybe i will add some more in the future</p>

<p>Edit 3: If you don&#39;t want to stick with bombs, no problem! Alchemy synergizes very well with signs and sword play too.</p>

<p>Edit 4: This community is stunning!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve been putting together a list of all the <a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com/Diagrams">Diagrams</a> in the game on the <a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com">Wiki</a> over the past few days. We have what their stats are, what you need to make them and where many of them are located. We&#39;ve broken them down into sections:</p>

<p><a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com/Weapon+Diagrams">Weapon Diagrams</a></p>

<p>Here you have your Crossbow Diagrams (of which I believe there are only 2), Bolt Diagrams (of which I believe there are 8 or so in the game, we have 5 listed and I will add the other 3 shortly)</p>

<p>You have your Steel Weapons and Silver Swords here. Included in this is of course the Feline, Griffin and Ursine Swords.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com/Armor+Diagrams">Armor Diagrams</a></p>

<p>These are broken down by slot: Chest, Gauntlets, Trousers and Boots. Inside each they are separated by Light, Medium and Heavy (in order of least armor to most). Again you will find the Feline, Griffin and Ursine sets here. I haven&#39;t gotten the locations for all of them yet, but most are there.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com/Glyph+Diagrams">Glyph Diagrams</a></p>

<p>Next you have Glyph Diagrams. These are used to create Glyphs for your Weapons and Armor. The table has been made, but much data is lacking here. Presumably since these are later game items. Would love to get some more info here.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewitcher3.wiki.fextralife.com/Runestone+Diagrams">Runestone Diagrams</a></p>

<p>Again the tables have been made, but not much else is known. We know what makes them, but not where to find these recipes. Would love more info to add here to help people as well.</p>

<p>These are all work in progresses. The lists and tables are made, if we could get some help filling them in with locations I think we&#39;d be done rather quickly and we&#39;d all have a great resource moving forward. I realize many of you are way late in the game and this might not be as useful to you, but this would be a great way to help out other players who haven&#39;t gotten to play yet or who are still towards the beginning/middle of the game.</p>

I wanted to do the whole thing without going online but I&#39;m glad I cheated a bit in this case.  I&#39;ve tried to avoid any potential spoilers and this list was great!  Is about as bare bones as you can get.  Happy Hunting!</p>

<p>Bear School (COMPLETE): </p>

<p>1 - Armourer, Oxenfurt </p>

<p>2,3,4 - Blacksmith near Bridge to Kaer Trolde </p>

<p>Cat School (COMPLETE): </p>

<p>1, 2 - Vendor and blacksmith in Backbough </p>

<p>4 - Hattory (It&#39;s name of Vendor, basically that elf which gives you quest Of Swords and Dumplings - You need to finish that quest in order to get the map) </p>

<p>Viper School: </p>

<p>There&#39;s no map or upgrades and it gear set has only two swords, it&#39;s like starter Witcher&#39;s gear. You can find it in White Orchard. You can start the quest in castle ruins by searching one of chests. </p>

<p>Edit:
Had a PM.  The first map is for The base set, each piece you need to find individually.  Then 2, 3, and 4 are Enh. Sup. Mast. respectively.  For maps 2, 3 and 4 There are three locations per map, all Armor Diagrams are found at one location.  Hope that clarifies things!</p>
