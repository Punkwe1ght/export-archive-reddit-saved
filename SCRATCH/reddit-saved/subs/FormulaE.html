<button onclick="toggles(600)">View full post</button><div id="600" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe they just don&#39;t want Canadians watching, or maybe I&#39;m missing something, but I can&#39;t find any of the races on YouTube or Facebook as every search indicates I should be able to. I can&#39;t find it on the paid TSN app or even using VPN into America with the CBS sports app. I&#39;ve been trying and can&#39;t find it. </p>

<p>I legitimately want to watch but I can&#39;t find any way, paid or not, to watch and I&#39;m ready to just write off Formula E. If any Canucks can help me find the races of this season I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make sense that something that&#39;s supposed to be rooted in modern times is impossible to watch online. I can&#39;t even find torrents.</p>
