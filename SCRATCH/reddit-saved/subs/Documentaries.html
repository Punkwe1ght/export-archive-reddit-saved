<button onclick="toggles(792)">View full post</button><div id="792" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I have posted this comment before but here we go again, a list of Trump’s tweets or quotes about Covid 19 at the beginning of the crisis: </p>

<p>January 22: When asked if there are worries about a pandemic, Trump responded: &quot;No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.&quot; [ABC News]</p>

<p>January 24: &quot;China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>January 30: &quot;We have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.&quot; [Politico]</p>

<p>January 31: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.” [NYT]</p>

<p>February 10: &quot;Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.&quot; [C-SPAN]</p>

<p>February 19: &quot;I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.&quot; [NYT]</p>

<p>February 23: &quot;We have it very much under control.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 24: &quot;The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.” [via Twitter]</p>

<p>February 26: “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 26: “We&#39;re going very substantially down, not up.”  [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 26: &quot;We&#39;re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list so that we&#39;re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time.&quot;   [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 26: &quot;You know in many cases when you catch this it is very light — you don’t even know there’s a problem. Sometimes they just get the sniffles, sometimes they just get something where they are not feeling quite right and sometimes they feel really bad but that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for and we will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.&quot;  [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 26: &quot;This is a flu. This is like a flu.&quot;  [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 27: &quot;We&#39;re rapidly developing a vaccine. The vaccine is coming along well, and in speaking to the doctors we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly.&quot; [NBC News]</p>

<p>February 27: &quot;It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.&quot; [ABC News]</p>

<p>February 27: &quot;The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people, and they&#39;re recovering, one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover. But the others are in great shape.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 28: “We&#39;re ordering a lot of supplies. We&#39;re ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn&#39;t be ordering unless it was something like this. But we&#39;re ordering a lot of different elements of medical.” [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>February 28: &quot;The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. ... They tried the impeachment hoax. ... And this is their new hoax.&quot; [C-SPAN]</p>

<p>March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don&#39;t think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?” [C-SPAN]</p>

<p>March 2: &quot;We had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies and they’re going to have vaccines, I think relatively soon.&quot; [NYT]</p>

<p>March 4: &quot;Because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They’ll get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor.&quot; [Politico]</p>

<p>March 4: &quot;If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.&quot; [AP]</p>

<p>March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>March 5: &quot;The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>March 6: &quot;I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 6: &quot;Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.” [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 6: &quot;I don&#39;t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn&#39;t our fault.&quot; [NPR]</p>

<p>March 7: &quot;I’m not concerned at all.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 8: &quot;We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>March 9: &quot;The Fake News media &amp; their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation.&quot; [via Twitter]</p>

<p>March 9: &quot;This blindsided the world.&quot; [USA Today]</p>

<p>March 10: &quot;It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.&quot; [MSNBC]</p>

<p>March 12: &quot;But it&#39;ll be -- it&#39;ll go very quickly.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 12: &quot;We&#39;ll be discussing some other moves that we&#39;re going to be making. And I think it&#39;s going to work out very well for everybody.&quot; [via Press Briefing]</p>

<p>March 13: [Declared state of emergency]</p>

<p>March 13: &quot;I don&#39;t take responsibility at all&quot; [C-SPAN]</p>

<p>March 17: &quot;This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.&quot; [AP]</p>
