<p>Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this is simply for the purposes of a Respect Thread; I do not intent to offend anyone with the content of this thread. These are simply some fictional characters that have some interesting things said about them and that is why I&#39;m writing this.</p>

<p><strong>The Satanists&#39; Feats/Info</strong></p>

<p>From <em>Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw the virgin... spawning forth the snake<br/>
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin<br/>
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame<br/>
Looked down on son ov god snuffed in vain  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Satanist is 2000 years (or more) old, indicating great longevity or perhaps immortality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nations fall prey<br/>
Hail my return  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>His rise and recognition among man is so great that nations fall apart under his influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tribe ov Judah decimate<br/>
Root ov David eradicate  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He possesses such power and influence as to put into effect a genocide against a huge amount of people.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>Furor Divinus</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Veto! I vomited forth<br/>
From a throat choked by rope<br/>
As lunatic mob<br/>
Shackled maimed feet<br/>
Tore asunder both wings<br/>
Pluck my eyes out<br/>
Rip my tongue<br/>
Make me slave to gravity<br/>
Bleed dry ov tears<br/>
Weep with blood<br/>
Leave to atrophy  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though he is is assaulted, beaten, crippled, etc...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sought reprisal high and low<br/>
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil<br/>
I crept under the shadow ov purity<br/>
In my hour ov pious wane  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...he endures and returns to his work, his resolve and power only strengthening, indicating a high capacity for recovery/healing. Possibly indicating a Zenkai-style power boost, as he now has moved from simply being an influential blasphemer to being able to spew diseases that taint the earth and being able to conceal himself from the pious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And so I reversed the wheel ov my fortune<br/>
Strike blind the eye ov the lion<br/>
With every breath stolen from their lips<br/>
I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has the power to deny fate has decided for him, to direct his path as he pleases. He also has the power to take the sight and breath from those who would trespass against him. The last line also indicates a very high amount of stamina and determination.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>Messe Noir</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I use words sharp as a sword<br/>
To rake Saints ’shins bestrewn<br/>
Three days risen – the grand deceiver<br/>
I bless the world with ire and woe  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even just his capacity for manipulation and diplomacy is as devastating as war itself, his words effecting the entire world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IHWH, thou sayeth unto me:<br/>
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!<br/>
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation<br/>
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about…<br/>
Became the law above all laws<br/>
In asymmetry ov the horns  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yaweh Himself addresses the Satanist as powerful enough to bring chaos to the world. In his punishments, though he burned to ash, this merely meant that he reached a kind of apotheosis and ascended to high-abstract level. This is supported by the following...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who shall churn hells across the earth<br/>
And reascend to seat himself…<br/>
At the left hand ov Satan<br/>
Be gaoler ov the living<br/>
…And ov the dead  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...indicating power over the realms of life and death, and power to bring hell to Earth.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>The Satanist</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I descended from the Mount Sinai<br/>
Unleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob<br/>
To shelter where no messianic light<br/>
Drove one single ray into the pulp ov life  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another reference to his age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I decompose in rapture ov hells<br/>
Dissolve divide disintegrate<br/>
I am yours<br/>
In euphoria below  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, even though you may see him as destroyed and completely gone, he is simply on another level of existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At faintest whim they would impale the sun<br/>
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has the power to forge the weakest parts of him into his strongest weapons; implied that this power was forged in the spiritual fire of the Sun.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>Ben Sahar</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As my ambition prescribes<br/>
Challenge the sun<br/>
Ascend shall I unto the heavens<br/>
Exalt my throne above his celestial display  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Satanist shall be even above the highest when his growth is complete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With freedom bequeathed<br/>
Thru fire we walk  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He possesses true freedom, and may pass through base threats as if they are nothing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>In The Absence Ov Light</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness<br/>
Never found on neither side ov the moon<br/>
It wields composure ov my soul<br/>
That comes as one with the odium below  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is capable of seeing spiritual matters and also possesses peace in his spirit, complete determination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I throw out each flaw, any idea.<br/>
I trust not any abstraction.<br/>
I believe not in god nor mind…  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has the power to deal with other abstractions, to see past schemes and dishonesty and to remove imperfections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh lord, whence came this doubt?<br/>
Thou doth know I am all and everything<br/>
Let loose my shackles<br/>
Let chaos reign  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he reaches his final form, he will become complete and endless, one with everything.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>O Father O Satan O Sun</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hear me, and make all spirits subjects unto me;<br/>
so that every spirit of the firmament and of the ether,<br/>
upon the earth and under the earth,<br/>
on dry land and in the water<br/>
of whirling air, and of rushing fire,<br/>
and every spell and scourge of god<br/>
may be obedient unto me.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final prayer and power, becoming the grandest under his lord. His final form not only heightens his previously mentioned power over the physical realm, but also gives him power over the spiritual realm, gives him powers of the Biblical god and grants him legions to do his bidding. This also heightens his abstraction powers, as he could control the spirits of other abstractions now. He also now commands great energy: the spirits of earth and wind and fire, etc.</p>

<p>But if this is simply what he develops naturally and what he&#39;s granted, then how powerful is the one who grants him this?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Satan&#39;s Feats/Info</strong></p>

<p>From <em>Furor Divinus</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emerge The accuser ov all<br/>
Hark the universe cries forlorn  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The presence of Satan causes the entire universe despair.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>Messe Noir</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe in Satan<br/>
Who rend both heavens and earth  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Satan tears apart the realms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satan ov Elohim,<br/>
None dare to stand in your way.<br/>
Thou bow to none,<br/>
Ov Eden&#39;s feculence.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is none who would try to oppose Satan, who bends to no power or presence of Heaven.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>Pro Ora Nobis Lucifer</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For thine is the kingdom,<br/>
And the power.<br/>
For thine is the kingdom,<br/>
And the glory,<br/>
Forever.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rule of Satan exceeds even the rule of Yaweh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rippling eager to erupt,<br/>
Reconstellate the firmament.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The release of Satan&#39;s power changes the position of various heavenly bodies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Destroyer ov cosmos,<br/>
Implore the ungod,<br/>
Implode the sun,<br/>
There is none wronging the serpent&#39;s cult.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The power of Satan could destroy the universe or, with more precision, simply collapse a star. In addition, his followers are protected and no person has the will to fight them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Untouched and ignored,<br/>
With the serpent&#39;s might,  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another statement of how Satan and his followers are protected and go without being seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hear the universe scream,<br/>
Bleeding from black holes,<br/>
Whom horns caress,<br/>
And whom God mourns.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Satan casually touches black holes, wounds inflicted in the universe. Possibly wounds inflicted by his horns.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <em>O Father O Satan O Sun</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bring down the sun<br/>
Extinguish all the stars<br/>
Let me remain<br/>
In splendor ov thy light  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implores him to use his power to take all light but his from the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bornless One<br/>
As darkness bright<br/>
Found not in tongues<br/>
Found not in light  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is incredibly subtle and beyond cause; there was nothing that caused him, yet he is, existing spiritually as a light behind and beyond the literal or even the conceptual.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agathos Daimon<br/>
Ov plague and fever<br/>
Thy name is nowhere<br/>
Thy name is never  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reinforcement of him as the most subtle and grand spirit, implied omnilock due to being outside of space and time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O Lion-Serpent Sun, The beast that whirlest forth,<br/>
a thunder-bolt, begetter of life!<br/>
Thou that flowest! Thou that goest!<br/>
Thou Satan-Sun, Hadith, that goest without will!<br/>
Thou Air! Breath! Spirit! Thou without bound or bond!<br/>
Thou essence, air swift-streaming, elasticity!<br/>
Thou wanderer, father of all!<br/>
Thou wanderer, spirit of all!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another part of the final prayer. He is the very substance of life and the cause of life and movement and energy and change. His is in and behind and with everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thou spiritual sun! Satan, thou eye, thou lust!<br/>
Cry aloud! Cry aloud!<br/>
Whirl the wheel, O my Father, O Satan, O Sun!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is the source of spiritual light and knowledge, and has power over fate.</p>
