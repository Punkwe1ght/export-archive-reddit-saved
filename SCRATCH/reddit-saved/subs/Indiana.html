<p>There are two problems with this question.</p>

<ol>
<li>It neglects the law of large numbers; and</li>
<li>It assumes that one of two things happen: you die or you’re 100% fine.The US has a population of 328,200,000. If one percent of the population dies, that’s 3,282,000 people dead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Three million people dead would monkey wrench the economy no matter what. That more than doubles the number of annual deaths all at once.</p>

<p>The second bit is people keep talking about deaths. Deaths, deaths, deaths. Only one percent die! Just one percent! One is a small number! No big deal, right?</p>

<p>What about the people who survive?</p>

<p>For every one person who dies:</p>

<p>19 more require hospitalization.</p>

<p>18 of those will have permanent heart damage for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>10 will have permanent lung damage.</p>

<p>3 will have strokes.</p>

<p>2 will have neurological damage that leads to chronic weakness and loss of coordination.</p>

<p>2 will have neurological damage that leads to loss of cognitive function.So now all of a sudden, that “but it’s only 1% fatal!” becomes:</p>

<p>3,282,000 people dead.</p>

<p>62,358,000 hospitalized.</p>

<p>59,076,000 people with permanent heart damage.</p>

<p>32,820,000 people with permanent lung damage.</p>

<p>9,846,000 people with strokes.</p>

<p>6,564,000 people with muscle weakness.</p>

<p>6,564,000 people with loss of cognitive function.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing that the folks who keep going on about “only 1% dead, what’s the big deal?” don’t get.</p>

<p>The choice is not “ruin the economy to save 1%.” If we reopen the economy, <strong>it will be destroyed anyway.</strong> The US economy cannot survive everyone getting COVID-19. </p>
