Learning with projects around the house and anything I have built has either been from reclaimed pallet wood or lumber from Lowe’s. I’m wanting to start working with hardwoods and actually start trying to make furniture and nicer things but lumber yards are a little overwhelming as I don’t really know what to do. What is the general practice? Do I just pull up and tell them what I want? Do I pull my own boards? Any help is appreciated, I’m also scouting YouTube lol thanks!</p>
