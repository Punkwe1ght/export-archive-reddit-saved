<h2>TIL That Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris' (known as the "Tool Box Killers") audio recording of their murder of Shirley Lynette Ledford is so horrible it is used to desensitize FBI agents.</h2>

<h2>TIL Ketamine was given to boys trapped in a cave to keep them unconscious & to prevent them from panicking during their six day rescue</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(737)">View full post</button><div id="737" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>A lot of people here seem to only know of ketamine as a street drug given in random and unpredictable/unknown doses without realizing that it&#39;s used every single day in almost every hospital in the world that provides sedation and general anesthesia. This is not remotely like having all the kids drop acid or shoot up some heroin. Ketamine is not a weird or unusual drug to use in a medical setting at all, though it&#39;s used in much different and more controlled dosing than I&#39;d assume is common in recreational use. I perform IV sedation for multiple patients every day and a lot of them get a small dose of ketamine along with other agents.  It&#39;s used because it&#39;s predictable in its effects and extraordinarily safe in most situations when dosed correctly. It can also be given intramuscularly unlike most other sedation medications, which would be advantageous in a Thai cave full of children as starting a whole bunch of IVs on already terrified children would be difficult even in the best of situations. This would be doubly so if it had to be administered by rescuers with limited to no advanced medical training. Additionally, it provides a substantial amount of pain control unlike most of the non-narcotic sedation agents, which may or may not have been useful in this case. </p>

<p>For this situation, it&#39;s the perfect drug because you can give it, reasonably safely, in a situation where you can&#39;t monitor vital signs and oxygenation. It can provide much more profound sedation than any of the oral anxiolytics, which is probably important when needing to wedge terrified children out of a cave. Most importantly, it&#39;s one of the very few agents that can provide predictable and effective moderate to deep sedation without affecting the respiratory drive. Benzos, narcotics, and most of the other effective anesthetic agents can easily stop a patient&#39;s breathing. If you don&#39;t have monitors or medical breathing devices, the kids could have easily died if their breathing slowed and it wasn&#39;t recognized and corrected. Ketamine doesn&#39;t really affect the respiratory drive, which is pretty unique for sedation agents. A little too much fentanyl can easily kill someone if breathing isn&#39;t supported. A lot too much ketamine, while not overly pleasant, is still very unlikely to kill an otherwise healthy person without underlying cardiovascular disease, especially a healthy child. Also, unlike many other anesthetic agents, it won&#39;t lower blood pressure or heart rate to potentially unsafe levels. It&#39;s also widely used in military field medicine and in some EMS situations for all of the same reasons, in addition to it&#39;s routine hospital use.</p>

<p>In short, if one is in a situation where you need to sedate someone relatively deeply in a remote setting with little to no medical monitoring equipment and limited emergency drugs/equipment, ketamine is the safest and most effective choice. I can&#39;t really think of another viable option actually, assuming you need the patient to be relatively deeply sedated, which is a reasonable need when squeezing a bunch of kids out of a hellish cave system. If you polled every anesthesiologist in the world for what drug they&#39;d recommend in a situation like this, I doubt you&#39;d have many other answers.</p>
