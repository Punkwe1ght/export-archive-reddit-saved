<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got this site from [username removed], credit to him.</p>

<p><a href="http://absurdlyobfuscated.com/tagger/">So this website right here can be used to tag 100&#39;s of reactionaries at once</a>, and I was hoping we could use this to pool together user tags to help make brigades more visible.</p>

<p>10 pages, minimum score of 3, 100 links per page by both /new and /top; note that there&#39;ll be a decent number of false positives though (2â€“4%, from users who stumbled upon subreddits like those by chance or didn&#39;t demonstrate any support for them at all), so you&#39;ll just have to sort them out when they show up.</p>

<p>Hope this helps! I&#39;d been looking for a solution to this issue so I&#39;m hoping you get some use out of it. </p>

<p>I made some gists to save you the time. I&#39;ll add the gists as they finish running. Follow the instructions on the site to merge, message me if you have questions. If you run the bot and have some lists of tags you would like to share please do so as well to help get more data points. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><del><strong>EDIT: I just discovered if the person has a capital letter in their name it makes the tag fail, working on a fix.</strong></del></p>

<p><strong>EASY TO READ INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>If you are using chrome, shut off spell checker, it will crash your browser</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you have RES tags, do this step. Otherwise skip to step 9</p></li>
<li><p>Press the . key on your keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>Enter &quot;RESStorage update RESmodules.userTagger.tags&quot; (no quotes)</p></li>
<li><p>Copy everything from that window that pops up into the &quot;My Tags&quot; section of the website</p></li>
<li><p>You need to convert the tags to lowercase to be compatible with current RES versions. <a href="http://convertcase.net/">I recommend using this website</a></p></li>
<li><p>Copy the list of tags you want to add into the &quot;New Tags&quot; section</p></li>
<li><p>Hit merge. This should merge the sets, it will not overwrite your current tags.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the list of merged tags/tag list</p></li>
<li><p>Press the . key on your keyboard, with RES keyboard navigation enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter &quot;RESStorage update RESmodules.userTagger.tags&quot; (no quotes)</p></li>
<li><p>A window should pop up. Paste the list into there. (if you have a slower pc, this may crash your browser, so you might want to copy and paste in segments)</p></li>
<li><p>Press confirm</p></li>
<li><p>Check in RES that all the tags are there, you should have over 600 pages of tags</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoy a reddit experience where you get to see all of the shitty parts astroturfing their ideals</p></li>
