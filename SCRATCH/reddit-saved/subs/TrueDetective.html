<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="/u/intrcpt">/u/intrcpt</a> made a comment on this post (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3c9imu/s2e3_spoilers_popular_fan_theory_referenced_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3c9imu/s2e3_spoilers_popular_fan_theory_referenced_in/</a>) that made me interested to read more about Lawrence King and Boys Town Nebraska. I couldn&#39;t watch the youtube video as its blocked here at work but when I googled his name one of the first links I saw had an image of a newspaper headline that I had just seen recently on a completely unrelated (so I thought) story. Here is the album I threw together of the two headline articles - <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1dZJZ">http://imgur.com/a/1dZJZ</a></p>

<p>While looking into the stuff going on over at <a href="/r/sadsatan">/r/sadsatan</a> someone posted a link to an article about The Dutroux Affair which occurred in Belgium and was believed to trickle over into the US and into which I started to really look at because the story sounded so crazily like the first season of True Detective, mainly with this article - (<a href="http://www.isgp.nl/Belgian_X_dossiers_of_the_Dutroux_affair_v1.1.php">http://www.isgp.nl/Belgian_X_dossiers_of_the_Dutroux_affair_v1.1.php</a> ----- This is NSFW and is a very, very long, but interesting nevertheless disgustingly sickening read)</p>

<p><strong>The Dutroux Affair reads so eerily close to S1 of True Detective that there is no way in hell some of the S1 story if not most all of it doesn&#39;t come from details of The Dutroux Affair... Their names and what they both did in their respective worlds are incredibly tied together with Reggie Ledoux and Marc Dutroux, reaching as that may be.</strong></p>

<p>So this is the article that I stumbled on when googling Lawrence Kings name (<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/Franklin/FranklinCoverup/franklin.htm">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/Franklin/FranklinCoverup/franklin.htm</a>)
(Now that I think about it, I think the X Dossiers even mention him by name, but using Larry King instead of Lawrence, I&#39;ll have to go back and check later today).</p>

<p>Later in the reddit post I linked first, <a href="/u/magopus6">/u/magopus6</a> posted a link which really helps to tie these two stories together, separated by continents as they may be. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a</a>) - if you only choose to read one link in this post, MAKE IT THIS ONE!!</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not sure where this season is going, but if it is indeed the Bohemian Grove or something along those lines, I believe that The Dutroux Affair and The Franklin Coverup are the links that will tie the first and second season of True Detective together.</p>

<p>Obviously there is so much left out of this post, like who Lawrence King even is, but I figure this is enough to entice y&#39;all to take a gander yourselves into this crazy world of Pedophile Rings seeing as how closely they are intertwined with this show.</p>

<p>I end this with a quote that is at the top of the X Dossier files from former CIA Director William Colby to John De Camp who wrote a book about the Franklin Cover up-</p>

<p>”What you have to understand, John, is that sometimes there are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do any­thing about them, no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face. You have done your part. You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing. It has hurt you terribly. But it has not killed you up to this point. I am telling you, get out of this before it does.”</p>

<p>Edit - I should add I am not pretending to be a super sleuth pouring over every detail to make my case. When I popped into the initial thread and read what I read earlier today and saw that newspaper article everything just kind of clicked. But again, this all on the basis that we end up at the bohemian grove this season so it is what it is and we&#39;ll all see it together. </p>
