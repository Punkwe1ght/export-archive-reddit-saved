<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I followed a recipe last week and made some limoncello that I was really pleased with. Did some more research and found some other alcoholic based drinks to make with the sous vide that I plan to gift to people this Christmas.</p>

<p>For one of my friends I wanted to make some spiced rum using a gold rum and adding vanilla, anise, and any other things I can come up with. Only thing is I couldn&#39;t find any specific write-ups on infusing a gold rum to make it a spiced rum.</p>

<p>Does anyone see anything wrong using the sous vide to help expedite the infusion process with the rum that I could be overlooking? I know they use it to infuse vodkas and tequilas so I think I should be good to go. Will the vanilla bean had adverse effects if heated?</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a silly question</p>

<h2>Protip: A sprinkle of baking soda on your steaks just before searing yields a crispy, caramelized crust.</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Salt steaks, (if they haven&#39;t been seasoned already).   </p>

<p>Pat dry,   </p>

<p>Sprinkle with soda, (I use about the same amount as I do salt.). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry if it looks powdery, it will be absorbed.  Get the sides and especially the fat as well.  Nothing better than crispy fat cracklins</p>

<p>Sear.</p>

<p>The baking soda&#39;s alkalinity speeds up the Maillard reaction giving a toasty crunch crust across the protein in less time and less risk of burning.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried this on grilling and pan searing and it works equally well with both methods.  The faster and more thorough Maillard reaction also means a better pan or grill release.</p>

<p>Also remember, salt draws moisture to the surface, so always salt after drying and immediately before searing. </p>
