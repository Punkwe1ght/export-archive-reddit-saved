<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to jump to the idea that it&#39;s just a racist black government picking on white people to stir up tension, but the situation is somewhat more nuanced than that. Race relations in South Africa are... complex, to say the least. One of the lingering resentments of the apartheid system is that despite the fact that it&#39;s less than 10% white as a country, the vast majority of South Africa&#39;s most profitable farmland is owned by white farmers, and the average income for white residents is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Annual_per_capita_personal_income_by_race_group_in_South_Africa_relative_to_white_levels.svg/1354px-Annual_per_capita_personal_income_by_race_group_in_South_Africa_relative_to_white_levels.svg.png">about five to eight times higher</a> than it is for black and coloured residents. Given the history of colonialism in Africa in general, this doesn&#39;t sit well with a lot of South Africans: people who came over and profited from South Africa&#39;s resources at the expense of the native population, then used that money and power to oppress black residents and make them literally second-class citizens, are widely regarded as having had too easy a ride for too long, propped up by laws and social structures that they designed to benefit the minority at the expense of the majority.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s worse than just white people buying up all the land and poor South Africans not being able to afford it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natives_Land_Act,_1913">The Natives Land Act of 1913</a>, for example, made it straight-up illegal for black people to own most of the land in their own country. The result? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/why-land-seizure-is-back-in-news-in-south-africa-quicktake-q-a">&#39;A government land audit released in February showed that farms and agricultural holdings comprise 97 percent of the 121.9 million hectares of the nation’s area, and that whites own 72 percent of the 37 million hectares held by individuals.&#39;</a> The Natives Land Act wasn&#39;t repealed until <em>1991</em>.</p>

<p>So a lot of South Africans feel that enough is enough. The former President, the famously-corrupt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma#Succession_and_resignation">Jacob Zuma</a>, was pretty much ousted in February, and was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma seemed to be dragging his feet on the issue, but Ramaphosa appears to have been making the option of repatriation (if not the actual repatriation) a priority for his new government. Now, this wasn&#39;t legal until very recently, but a coalition between the ANC (majority party, 62% of seats) and the EFF (the Economic Freedom Fighters: third biggest party, with 6.4% of the seats) has sought to change that with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-land-exproriation/vote-in-south-africas-parliament-moves-land-reform-closer-idUSKCN1GB22I">a resolution on changing the constitution made recently</a>... but that&#39;s a problem in and of itself. The EFF have said some deeply unpleasant shit on the matter in recent months, including their leader saying in 2016 -- and I quote -- &#39;We [the EFF] are not calling for the slaughter of white people‚ at least for now&#39;. (In fairness, the next line in the speech was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrlLQFbVOs&amp;feature=youtu.be">&#39;What we are calling for is the peaceful occupation of the land&#39;</a>, but it&#39;s still hard to see that as anything but a threat.) Many are worried -- and perhaps with good reason -- that repatriation of white-owned land will only inflame racial tension and lead to violence in a country that is less than twenty-five years out from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">Apartheid</a>. Pieter Groenewald, leader of the Freedom Front Plus party representing the white Afrikaner minority, asked what would happen to the land once it was expropriated: <a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/the-time-for-reconciliation-is-over-south-africa-votes-to-confiscate-whiteowned-without-compensation/news-story/a8a81155995b1adc1c399d3576c4c0bc">&#39;If you continue on this course, I can assure you there is going to be unforeseen consequences that is not in the interest of South Africa.&#39;</a></p>

<p>The closest equivalent, so the argument in favour goes, is to the freeing of slaves in post-civil war America. Yes, <em>technically</em> you&#39;re taking the legally-owned property of law-abiding citizens, but buying back the land/slaves would straight-up ruin the government and take centuries to pay off, even once you get past the ethical minefield that is whether or not the profiting from racist laws is something that a country wants to allow.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s also worth pointing out that similar efforts in other countries have <em>not</em> ended well, historically speaking. In Zimbabwe, white farmers were subjected to often-horrific violence by black residents, leading to Genocide Watch to call it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120916074945/http://www.genocidewatch.org/zimbabwe.html">&#39;stage 5 case&#39;</a> (out of eight stages in their scale; either way, not great).</p>

<p><strong>So there&#39;s the issue South Africa faces now.</strong> These white landowners are South Africans, many going back generations. They have done nothing wrong themselves, but they are profiting massively from historical laws that were monumentally, staggeringly, <em>unbelievably</em> racist, and falsely propped up a colonialist legacy at the expense of native populations in the way that has rarely been seen in recent history. Is it acceptable for the government to step in and reset the balance -- to say that the restitution that would be fair has already been paid in full? Is it morally acceptable to allow this imbalance, a product of the worst kind of colonialism, to continue? What happens to the land once they take it from people who&#39;ve been farming it for generations, and give it to people who might not know what the hell they&#39;re doing? And if they do decide to step in, can they do this without inciting violence in a way that Zimbabwe fell victim to in the last twenty years?</p>

<p>EDIT: My post originally implied that the law had already been changed; in fact the vote was a resolution to change the constitution. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-land-exproriation/vote-in-south-africas-parliament-moves-land-reform-closer-idUSKCN1GB22I">Parliament has instructed a committee to review the constitution and report back to it by the end of August.</a> Sorry for any confusion.</p>
