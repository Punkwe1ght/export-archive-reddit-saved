<h2>Protip: sameday.costco.com allows you to check if an item is being sold at your local Costco and its price</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(479)">View full post</button><div id="479" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The sameday.costco.com site allows you to order items from your nearest Costco for delivery, but some of you may also find it to be useful to see if certain rotational items are sold at your local Costco. I do not know whether an item being listed means that it&#39;s definitely in stock. The prices are all inflated, but for the items I previously ordered and have checked, the online prices are 17% higher than the in-store prices at our local Costco, so you can calculate what the lower in-store price is. </p>

<p>A shame is that as far as I can tell, if you want to check item availability at another site, you have to put in a different delivery address and check warehouses one-by-one, rather than having the option of checking multiple warehouses at once or those within a certain area. Asking someone at the warehouse would be an option, but for people familiar with this system, is there a better way to look for a hard-to-find item through the website rather than changing manually to different warehouses?</p>
