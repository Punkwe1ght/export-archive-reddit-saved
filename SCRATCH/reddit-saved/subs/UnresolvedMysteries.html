<h2>"The Huang Yanqiu Incident" A rural villager would on three separate occasions go missing after going to bed only to wake up in a major city thousands of miles away and arrived in the city faster than he should've been possible given the distance.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(142)">View full post</button><div id="142" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/dzRf8Hr.jpg">Huang Yanqiu</a> was born in 1956 in Dongbeigao Village in China&#39;s Hebei province. Little is known about his early life aside from the fact that he worked as a farmer in the village and his mother passed away while he was a child.</p>

<p>On July 27, 1977, Huang was 21 years old and still working as a farmer. Huang was recently engaged and planned on marrying his fiancee after the harvest season and the couple recently began building themselves a new home. At 10:00 PM Huang had just finished his farm work for the day and went to bed in his unfinished home. That was the last anyone had seen of Huang for a while as the next morning when the village woke up on July 28 Huang was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>The village was greatly alarmed by Huang&#39;s disappearance and initiated a massive search effort to try and find him but there was no trace of Huang anywhere to be found. This worried and confused the villagers especially Huang&#39;s family as Huang never travelled far and only had a primary school level education. They searched the surrounding roads, ponds, cliffs and other unknown locations to try and find him and even contacted the nearest hospitals and police to ask if any unidentified bodies had been discovered but to no avail.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Huang would be found alive and unharmed but this only resulted in more questions. 10 days later on August 6 the village committee received a telegram from Shanghai. The telegram said that Huang was being held at a deportation center and that they were hoping for a local to come and pick him up. The telegram was late to arrive because it was accidentally addressed to the wrong village. There was just one problem, the telegram from Shanghai was dated at 9:AM on July 28 less than half a day after his disappearance. Huang was later returned by the police in Shanghai and it was indeed Huang. There was just one problem, Huang being in Shanghai that soon should&#39;ve been impossible.</p>

<p>Huang was questioned by his fellow villagers and he could not provide an answer. According to him, he went to bed and when at 6:00 or 7:00 AM he was awoken by a loud noise, this noise wasn&#39;t that of the farm animals but instead the sounds of vehicles and numerous people. When he fully awoke he found himself on a sidewalk and that around him were cars, neon lights and tall buildings/skyscrapers. He wondered around and saw writing on the various buildings and businesses which said things such as &quot;Nanjing Shopping Center&quot;, &quot;Nanjing Restaurant&quot;, and &quot;Nanjing Pharma&quot; and that nearby was a large &quot;swimming pool&quot; which he later found out was Lake Xuanwu. It didn&#39;t take Huang long to realize that somehow he was in Nanjing the capital city of Jiangsu Province located 485 miles away from his home village.</p>

<p>While Huang who was now in complete and utter shock at his circumstance walked aimlessly around the unfamiliar city until he was stopped and approached by two police officers. Huang due to his state of shock and disbelief could barely answer their questions. When they asked Huang what he was doing or who he was he simply said that he was &quot;really lost&quot; the two officers led Huang to the Nanjing Rail Station and gave him a ticket to Shanghai and told Huang that they would be waiting for him and once he arrived he&#39;d be taken to a &quot;repatriation camp&quot; for migrants and those without a hukou document. Huang not knowing what else to do and being in no position to disobey or resist bordered the train. 4 hours later the train pulled into Shanghai station and Huang headed out for the first police station he could find and to his confusion, the exact same police officers from Nanjing were already waiting for him despite being out of their jurisdiction, not boarding the train before him and most of all the train was the fastest method available at the time to travel between the two cities and the officers did not bored the train. Arriving to Shanghai before Huang should be straight-up impossible.</p>

<p>The two officers refused to let Huang enter the police station in Shanghai and instead dropped Huang off at the repatriation camp in Shanghai. Huang first told his story to a PLA soldier at the camp named LÃ¼ Qingtang and added the detail that the police officers in question were likely from Shandong province based on the ticket he was given. Huang stayed in the camp much longer than expected as when Huang woke up in Nanjing he didn&#39;t have any of his identity documents and when the telegrams were sent out to the village to come collect Huang they erroneously addressed them to Xinzhai Village instead of Dongbeigao Village. The confusion was only cleared up after Huang was identified via a birthmark and because the PLA soldier Huang talked to had relatives in the village.</p>

<p>As mentioned any questions the villagers had were multiplied as opposed to answered. Huang arriving in Nanjing that soon should be impossible. At the time trains in China were too slow to make such a fast trip. The nearest rail station was in the city of Handan which Huang would&#39;ve had to find his way to in the dark despite having never even been to Handan before. But even if he did make it to Handan all by himself with next to no money the train would take 1 whole day to reach Nanjing as opposed to the 9-10 hours between when Huang went to sleep and when he woke up. And this is without taking into account the waiting time for the train to arrive at Haidan station and trains were notoriously late back them sometimes even being held back by an entire day and tickets were expensive.</p>

<p>Other methods of transportation also wouldn&#39;t work out. Planes and civilian aviation travel in China was still very new and of course expensive. The entirety of Hebei Province only had a tiny handful of airports with the closest one being in the north near Beijing located on the complete opposite side of Hebei from where Huang lived. It was deemed highly unlikely for Huang to make the trip there by himself especially as he wouldn&#39;t know the way and even if he did somehow make it to the airport there would still be the issue of paying for a ticket. A car also wouldn&#39;t work as nobody in Dongbeigao village owned a vehicle and even having a bicycle was considered immensely expensive and outside the means of the villagers. And even if he could use any of these methods it still wouldn&#39;t explain the short time as to even get from Dongbeigao village to the nearest city Handan would take 4 hours to drive from the village to the city by car. There was also the question of why Huang would assuming he wasn&#39;t lying would do this. Huang had never mentioned Nanjing or Shanghai at any point prior and the fact that leaving their ancestral village and families was frowned upon. How Huang made it to Nanjing in such a short amount of time is unknown but most villagers were prepared to accept it as a strange oddity and move on while others dismissed Huang as lying or bragging about visiting a city. That was until it happened again.</p>

<p>On September 8, 1977, it was harvest season in the village again and Huang and his fellow villagers were made to do backbreaking work during a meeting held by the village cadres. At 10:00 PM the head of the village gave Huang and a few other villagers permission to leave and go to bed early as long as they send and deliever manure/fertilizer the next morning. They all took the cadres up on this offer and went to sleep. The next morning on September 9 the villagers arrived at the fertiliser storage area only to notice that Huang was missing. Thinking that he had overslept they all went to his house only to find it empty. Something different caught their eye however, Carved into his bedroom wall was a message and that message said &quot;Shandong Gao Dengmin, Gao Yanjin Relax&quot;</p>

<p>Just like the last time Huang was in Shanghai and was quickly sent back to the village on September 11 and this time there were witnesses both in Shanghai and Dongbeigao. A majority of the village witnessed Huang go to his house and sleep before his disappearance the next morning and just like with his first disappearance Huang couldn&#39;t explain it.</p>

<p>According to Huang, he woke up at The Shanghai Rail Station due to a cold breeze, the same one the two mysterious police officers sent him to. Huang was again startled by his surroundings as it was the middle of the night and according to the Station&#39;s clock tower, it was 2:00 AM and as far as Huang could see there were no other people and the only light came from the stars and moon. Not only had Huang unknowingly travelled a far distance in an impossibly short time but he also did it at an inopportune time because along with the darkness Huang was constantly startled by the sound of thunder, lighting and battered by heavy rain and high winds because Typhon Babe had recently made landfall near Shanghai.</p>

<p>Huang who was now even more terrified than he was before could only think of LÃ¼ Qingtang, LÃ¼ was the PLA soldier who helped him after his first trip to Shanghai and was the one who ultimately helped him return home due to his relatives in the village. LÃ¼ was not only the only person Huang could think to help him but he was also the only person he knew at all in Shanghai. Finding LÃ¼ was not going to be easy as Huang wouldn&#39;t be able to navigate Shanghai at all let alone during a typhoon in the middle of the night with no people in sight.</p>

<p>As Huang began to walk he heard a voice coming from behind him hearing a man say &quot;Hello there, you must be Huang Yanqiu of Feixiang County. Trying to head to the artillery division?&quot; this shocked him immensely and he quickly turned back to see who this person was. When he turned around he saw two men dressed in military uniforms. They told Huang that they were soldiers belonging LÃ¼&#39;s division and were assigned to pick him up from the railway station.</p>

<p>Huang followed the men who took various ferries and buses before arriving at the &quot;artillery division&quot; located in what is today the Pudong District. Despite how heavily guarded the area is the guards let Huang and the two men pass without issue. They then went to where LÃ¼ lived with his family and they were completely shocked to see them as well as Huang again. LÃ¼ however, wasn&#39;t home at the time. His wife Li Yuying was surprised that the three were even at their home because according to Li &quot;When a relative comes to visit, they have to show their legal documents and sign in at the gate, we&#39;ll then come down and confirm their identities, then they can finally be let in. No way the guards and soldiers would let them in without any proceedings!&quot; and years later LÃ¼&#39;s son when questioned about the case would say that the two solider&#39;s uniforms looked off, he commented that  .  &quot;...their uniforms looked quite the ordinary, yet not very fitting, especially their visors. One&#39;s shoes and visor are the most important part of the uniform,... their visors were too big, and their uniforms seem to have been borrowed, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Before his family could question the two they simply walked away and couldn&#39;t be found again. Huang being at the base was a major security violation and officials interrogated the guards on duty who all claimed to have never seen Huang and the two soldiers at any point. Once LÃ¼ returned home another telegram was sent directly to the head of Dongbeigao Village and they wanted to know every last detail about Huang and who exactly he was with the telegram even straight up asking if Huang was a spy. They received a response from the head of the village, telling them that Huang was just a farmer with no ill intent. Without any other information, the army decided to send Huang back to the village but sternly warned him that he&#39;d be arrested if they ever see him again. He returned home on September 11. In their official reports the military was unable to explain how Huang got to Shanghai so quickly and managed to get into the base.</p>

<p>Due to the multitude of witnesses testifying that Huang went to sleep in the village and the military confirming that he was in Shanghai all those who felt that Huang was lying about his travels soon had their doubts erased. Huang became the most talked about resident of the village and not in a good way as he became the main subject of all the local gossip, rumours and of course superstitions. Many thought that he was possessed or haunted with that being the reason for his seemingly supernatural speed and ability to travel such short distances. The constant attention took a mental toll on Huang&#39;s fiance who sued his family for 200 yuan due to &quot;reputational damages&quot; and divorced him. This financially and emotionally ruined Huang and it was when he was at his lowest that the third and final incident happened.</p>

<p>Huang continued his work as a farmer and labourer for the village and on September 20, 1977, he had finished his work for the day and began walking home. According to Huang, however, so tired that he ended up passing out in the yard in front of his house and went missing again. He would stay missing until September 28 when he was found under a Jujube tree in the village and when asked where he had been he told them about the most extraordinary story yet.</p>

<p>According to him, after he passed out in front of his home he woke up and instead of on the sidewalk or in a deserted train station during typhoon season he instead found himself in a luxury hotel room. He looked around and behind him, he saw the same two men from the first two incidents. This time, however, they were both dressed in civilian clothing and introduced themselves. They told Huang that they were brothers from Shandong Province and identified themselves as Gao Dengmin, 26, and Gao Yanjin, 25. Huang also estimated that they were around 170 cm tall. They told Huang that they were the cause behind his disappearances and that they dressed as police and soldiers to help him find his way home, they said that they had something special planned for Huang and that during the next 9 days, they would take him to 9 major cities. Huang asked where he was right now and the brothers told him that it was still September 20 and that he was in Lanzhou located in China&#39;s Gansu Province the furthest he has ever been from home.</p>

<p>Soon Huang would learn how he had travelled so far so quickly because the next day on September 21 they made Huang climb onto their back and as Huang would later state &quot;They took off&quot; and quite literally flew away with just their bodies. Huang said that they were &quot;flying&quot; at a low altitude and that he didn&#39;t feel any wind, he also recounted that the brothers took turns carrying him on their back. In over an hour, the three had arrived in Beijing. They first went to the Chang&#39;an Grand Theater without tickets and just like at the army base nobody stopped them. They watched an opera performance of Forced Onto Mt. Liang. Their next stop was Tiananmen Square and were in front of a Huabiao. The brothers who were now speaking standard Mandarin instead of their dialects introduced Huang to the surrounding areas and checked into a hotel showing the staff a  &quot;provincial-level introduction letter&quot; for registration. That same day they then flew to Tianjin where they snuck into a movie theatre without tickets and watched a movie.</p>

<p>On September 22 they arrived in Harbin located in Heilongjiang Province. In Harbin, they visited a department store and then visited Changchun in Jilin Province. On September 23 they went to Shenyang in Liaoning Province. On September 25 they visited Fuzhou in Fujian Province before visiting Nanjing. They spend the next day in Nanjing. On September 27 they visited Xi&#39;an in Shaanxi Province for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Also on September 27, they made their last stop returning to  Lanzhou. When Huang went to sleep in their hotel room he woke up under the jujube tree mentioned earlier and was back in Dongbeigao Village</p>

<p>They travelled to every city via the brothers flying and according to Huang no matter how close or how far the city was the time it took to get there was always 1 hour. He also noted that the brothers could speak the local dialects of all the provinces they visited and whenever they went to hotels the brothers always had a &quot;provincial-level introduction letter&quot;. One of the brothers always watched Huang while the other would borrow clothing such as police or military uniforms from somewhere Huang didn&#39;t know. Clothing and yuan for the accommodations and meals were the only items the brothers carried as they didn&#39;t seem to own items such as bags and wallets. Aside from their ability to fly to anywhere they wanted and their strange behaviour such as only carrying clothes and money, Huang said that they were seemingly normal human beings in every other aspect and ate and slept like anyone else. They also had the same body temperature as anyone else would  The only rules they seemed to have were that Huang was not allowed to photograph them or anything and he couldn&#39;t keep any souvenirs from his trips. When Huang asked why they singled him out they wouldn&#39;t respond and when he asked if they could teach him how to fly like them or tell him how they learnt to do it they gave a firm &quot;No&quot; as their answer. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZFNqh2m.png">Just as they had told him in the 9 days he was missing they had visited 9 different cities.</a></p>

<p>Huang was the talk of the village all over again and the superstitions that gods or ghosts were responsible continued. Eventually, the gossip around Huang had gotten to the point that the local police, propaganda department and the nearest military base had heard of Huang&#39;s story and began a very extensive investigation into Huang. Offical&#39;s believed that he was purposefully sabotaging the village&#39;s production and reputation and proceeded to classify him as a &quot;class enemy&quot; While being interrogated his behaviour was found to be &quot;normal&quot; and he showed no signs of mental illness or cognitive disorders. After they were unable to find any evidence of Huang being a threat they reluctantly let him go and revoked his &quot;class enemy&quot; status.</p>

<p>Huang&#39;s story became well known throughout China and is one of the country&#39;s most famous alleged paranormal events and even the government officially declares his case as &quot;unexplained&quot; This is not the end of Huang&#39;s story though.</p>

<p>On December 14, 2004, the case was reinvestigated by Zhang Jingping, an investigator of the Beijing Branch of the China UFO Association, Ji Jianmin, the chairman of the Feixiang UFO Association, and Dr. Wu, a famous Chinese hypnotist, professor of Peking University Medical Department. There was rather conclusive evidence of Huang&#39;s first two incidents as numerous witnesses as well as official telegrams all confirm that Huang had gone to sleep in his home village only to appear in Shanghai but there was far more doubt as to if he had been to any of the cities mentioned during his third disappearance.</p>

<p>Huang was put under hypnosis and asked what happened and he told the doctor the same story he did back in 1977. Huang eventually woke up from the hypnotic state claiming that one of the two brothers made him wake up. In 2004 a documentary was made by CCTV and several interviews and tests were conducted during the documentary. He was subjected to a polygraph test and he ended up failing the test and Huang refused to accept these results. Those administering the tests also admitted that Huang&#39;s declining memory, the 27-year gap between the test and the incident and the stress of being subjected to such a test for the first time may affect the results. During the documentary, the police based on Huang&#39;s descriptions also created <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3CyKWzt.jpg">composite sketches of Gao Dengmin and Gao Yanjin</a>. Due to the advancement in China&#39;s transportation infrastructure, Huang was brought to Nanjing and he was able to retrace his steps and attempt to recreate his journey from the sidewalk to the former then non-existent military base.</p>

<p>They then brought Huang to the physiatric division of Beijing Anding Hospital where the lead doctor after reading his statements said that the brothers would&#39;ve been travelling at supersonic speeds and that Huang had been sleepwalking or lying. Although nobody defended him from claims of sleepwalking his fellow villagers all refused to entertain the possibility that Huang was purposefully lying to them. They cited Huang&#39;s lack of motivation or ability to travel, how he travelled to Shanghai in such a short amount of time and how he had no reason to lie about it since telling his story caused him to become a laughing stock and lost him his fiance. Huang quite literally gain nothing from telling this story and it severely affected him negatively. Aside from a lack of evidence others supporting the lying theory state that Huang only claimed to have visited major cities prompting some to speculate that he just picked them out from a map and that oddly enough he never visited Shijiazhuang which is the capital of Hebei, the province that Huang actually lives in.</p>

<p>Huang was examined by other psychologists and mental health professionals who deemed Huang to be sane which is the source of the sleepwalking theory.</p>

<p>As this theory suggests, Huang was sleepwalking when he made his way to Nanjing and that the stories of the two brothers were just dreams he had while sleepwalking. Various Chinese netizens don&#39;t view this theory as credible since Huang while sleepwalking would need to either walk all the way to the train station in Handan (which would take 4 hours to drive to by car) and buy a tick with money he didn&#39;t have all while asleep. And while still sleeping once the train stopped in Zhengzhou he would&#39;ve sleepwalked onto the next train to Shanghai all with nobody noticing he was sleepwalking and waking him up. Just to be sure though doctors performed an MRI scan of Huang&#39;s brain and the results came back normal.</p>

<p>The third theory is that Huang suffered from multiple personality disorder and that Gao Dengmin and Gao Yanjin were in fact Huang himself and that he just perceived them as different people due to his disorder. The Gao personalities are the ones that actually travel to the locations only for Huang&#39;s normal personality to take over once he arrives at the destination hence him waking up. This theory also states that Huang flying on their backs is actually just a fantasy of Huang Yanqiu&#39;s repressed personality. This theory doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny as various Mental Health officials have found Huang sane and that he would&#39;ve shown signs of multiple personality disorder before and after the three incidents. This theory also wouldn&#39;t explain the short travel times and LÃ¼ Qingtang&#39;s wife and son also witnessing the two as separate people.</p>

<p>There is one more theory though it is from those who want to believe that it is all real and that Huang is telling the truth and that UFOs may be involved.</p>

<p>They looked further into Huang&#39;s claims to try and find any proof that he was in the cities mentioned during his third disappearance. According to one source when describing the weather they matched up with geological data at the time but this appears to be unconfirmed. A journalist went to the Chang&#39;an Grand Theater in Beijing to look through their records and see if they ever held the same performance Huang claimed to have seen.</p>

<p>He discovered that the theatre closed due to the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake and wouldn&#39;t reopen until 1979 meaning that Huang could not have seen any performances in that theatre. However, there was another theatre nearby named the Jixiang Theater and they were open in 1977 and on September 21, 1977, the day Huang claimed to be in Beijing they held a performance of <em>F</em>orced Onto Mt. Liang. This journalist ruled that Huang hailing from a small and rural village could&#39;ve easily confused two nearby and similar theatres in an unfamiliar environment such as the major city of Beijing.</p>

<p>There are also those who agree that Huang travelled at nearly supersonic speeds but instead have a more terrestrial explanation and that Huang fell victim to military experimentation.</p>

<p>This theory states that the military flew Huang to these cities for various experiments and that the Gao brothers were high-ranking officials in charge of the experiments. They then drugged Huang and made him undergo hypnosis to make him forget what he experienced. Many are skeptical of this theory because if the Chinese government wanted to conduct human experimentation they had a myriad of death row inmates and political prisons to draw upon so why instead abduct an innocuous rural farmer from his small village?</p>

<p>&quot;The Huang Yanqiu Incident&quot; remains one of China&#39;s most infamous unsolved mysteries but as of now, there have been no new developments as a now 67-year-old Huang has opted to live a quiet life in his village away from the cameras. The last bit of news from Huang came from 2008 when he underwent another round of mental evaluations</p>

<p>~ </p>

<p>You have awoken me from my slumber.  I have been summoned from retirement by someone posting about the Lindbergh baby. I cannot sit idly by when conspiracy theories are being spread.</p>

<p>Hi, Iâm surprise_b1tch, and you can read my series of posts on the Lindbergh Trial <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insomniac_nightmares/comments/nd9gh1/true_crime/">here</a>, along with a bunch of other write-ups I made back when I had free time.  The trial took place in my hometown.  It was a part of my fifth grade curriculum.  I attended a reenactment at the Historic Flemington Courthouse.  I walked by the Courthouse (still standing) and Jail (still standing) and haunted Union Hotel (falling apart while in legal limbo) every day.  As you can see, Iâm perhaps a little too interested in this case.  I was researching it for a while, but ultimately decided that I had nothing to add to what I consider the definitive book on the case, <em>Hauptmannâs Ladder</em> by Richard T. Cahill Jr.</p>

<p>You see, to get anything published on a case as old and as popular as the Lindbergh kidnapping, you need to come up with a juicy new theory - or else no one cares.  Books with a fun new theory <em>sell.</em>   If your groundbreaking theory is âeveryone is right - Hauptmann did it, and did it aloneâ - well, no one cares.  Good luck getting published.  (Honestly, how did Cahill do it?!)</p>

<p>If you want a thorough explanation of the case, I advise reading that book.</p>

<p>In short, I will offer what I consider the most prominent evidence. Iâm not going to cite anything, in the interest of time; Iâm going to broadly wave at Google, Cahill, and my previous posts to cover my ass.  If you have any specific questions Iâll be happy to find sources for you.</p>

<p><strong>Letâs Get Into It: Woodgrain Forensics Donât Lie</strong></p>

<p>The Lindbergh Trial is notable in that it was one of the first cases in the US decided based on forensic evidence.  Specifically, this case was decided based on forensic woodgrain analysis.</p>

<p>Look through the photos yourself <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/archives/slcsp001.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, this woodgrain analysis came from the ladder used in the kidnapping and the wood floorboards of the attic of Hauptmannâs house.  Some of the wood used in the ladder was purchased from a lumber mill, however, some of it was made from the floorboards of his house.</p>

<p>Thatâs right.  This wood was <em>built into Hauptmannâs home.</em>  You can view a picture of his attic in the above link.  Hauptmann built the ladder out of his own house.</p>

<p>This forensic evidence has been analyzed by modern professionals and is as strong today as it was in 1935: conclusive beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p><strong>For any conspiracy theory to work, Hauptmann</strong> <strong><em>had</em></strong> <strong>to have been in on it.</strong></p>

<p>Hauptmann was caught spending the ransom money, and more of the ransom money was found in his house.  Forensic bookkeeping accounted for every penny of the ransom money either being in Hauptmannâs possession or having been spent by Hauptmann in the following years.</p>

<p>If you want to argue that Hauptmann was conspiring with Lindbergh - well, feel free, but there is absolutely no evidence to support the argument.  Nothing was ever found linking Lindbergh and Hauptmann.  They had no contact prior to the kidnapping.  No phone calls, no letters, no testimony from someone who had ever seen them together.  There is no evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Was the crime capable of being carried out alone?</strong></p>

<p>In a word, yes.  It wasnât that hard.  Hauptmann scouted the Lindberghâs home in advance (his car was seen there multiple times in the weeks/days prior).  He knew which window was the nursery - the day of, Anne went for a walk, and waved up to her son as his nanny held him in the nursery window.  Hauptmann was probably watching at that time, if he hadnât already confirmed the location.   Hauptmann had observed the familyâs routine and knew when the baby would be put to bed.</p>

<p>March 1, 1932 was a windy night, and it wouldâve been hard to hear much of anything over the wind outside.  Despite this, the Lindberghs actually heard the kidnapping take place - they heard a sound that sounded like a crate in their pantry coming apart.  However, they brushed it off and did not investigate.</p>

<p>This was likely the ladder breaking.  The ladder was handcrafted by Hauptmann, who was a carpenter.  The ladder was built to be as light as possible, and was constructed in three sections, so that it would fit in Hauptmannâs car.  However, Hauptmann had calculated the ladder to support just <em>his</em> weight - not the weight of him and the baby. The ladder broke on his way down, and this is likely when he dropped the baby.  I believe this is the point where the baby died, though there&#39;s no way to know for sure.</p>

<p>Even if the baby unexpectedly died in the fall, there is no evidence that Hauptmann ever made preparations to keep the baby alive (contrary to what he would tell Lindbergh).  There is no evidence as to what his plan was beyond the ransom.</p>

<p><strong>Actions Taken After the Kidnapping</strong></p>

<p>This was the year of our Lord 1932, and crime scene forensics were in their infancy -  so much so that the police actually botched the taking of fingerprints in the nursery.  Lindbergh was an American hero, and the police granted him exceptions they would not have otherwise.  That said, <strong>they did not bungle the deciding evidence: the ladder and Hauptmann spending the ransom money.</strong>  This is what convicted Hauptmann.  This is the evidence that still stands strong today.</p>

<p><strong>Was the Baby Deformed?  And How Fucked Up Is It That Weâre Asking That, Anway?</strong></p>

<p>So where did all this bullshit about the baby come from?</p>

<p>Lindbergh was a celebrity.  Not just celebrity - he was American <em>royalty.</em>  He was so famous that his celebrity cannot be overstated.  Lindbergh made the first solo transatlantic flight, and became a worldwide household name.</p>

<p>Anne, the daughter of a US Ambassador, was not exactly a nobody either.  The two of them together were a power couple.</p>

<p>As a result, they were no strangers to the paparazzi.  In fact, the two would dress in disguises sometimes just to be able to walk down the street in NYC without being spotted.</p>

<p>Understandably, when Lindbergh had his baby, he wanted to shield him from the spotlight.  He gave the paparazzi little access to his son.  The paparazzi didnât like this, so naturally, they speculated wildly about <em>why</em> Lindbergh wouldnât give them access to his infant child - because it couldnât be simply because he wanted some damn privacy.  They speculated wildly about all sorts of diseases and malformations.  Clearly, Lindbergh needed to be ashamed of his son in order to keep him from the paparazzi.  Thatâs why he wouldnât let them take pictures of him and stalk him constantly.</p>

<p>Itâs giving Michael Jackson making his kids wear masks all the time.  Britney Spears attacking a paparazzo with an umbrella.  Ah, some things never change!</p>

<p>Here is how disgusting the paparazzi were at that time: when Lindberghâs son was in the morgue, a paparazzo snuck in and snapped pictures of his deceased, partly skeletal corpse.  And published them.</p>

<p>In response to this (it is speculated), Lindbergh ordered the body of his son cremated.  He felt that a gravesite would surely be vandalized.  I mean, they SNUCK IN THE MORGUE AND TOOK A PICTURE OF HIS DEAD BABY.  Whoâs to say some whackadoo wouldnât try to dig up the grave?!</p>

<p>But of course, that just created MORE speculation.  He cremated his baby to destroy evidence!!!</p>

<p><strong>Hereâs the facts: There is absolutely no evidence, in the autopsy or from testimony of those who cared for the baby, that Charles Jr. had any deformities.</strong> I recall reading a quote from his pediatrician saying he was healthy and normal and well-developed, but I do not have time to track it down right now, so Iâll quote from <em>Hauptmannâs Ladder</em> instead:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lindberghs became very secretive about their son as they felt the constant media exposure was not a positive influence.  Unfortunately, the attempt to protect him led to numerous rumors that the child was somehow deformed.  The media speculated that they were being kept away from the child because Charles Lindbergh was embarrassed about his sonâs imperfection.  It never occurred to reporters that they were the real reason for the Lindberghâs overprotectiveness of their child.  </p>

<p>â¦The rumors were so out of control that Charles felt compelled to call a press conference.  Five newspaper chains were not permitted to attend as they had actually published stories claiming that the child was deformed.  Lindbergh specifically addressed the media about their coverage of his son by saying, âOne thing I do hope for him, and that is when he is old enough to go to school, there will be no reporters dogging his footsteps.â</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Iâm citing this from an ebook, so no page numbers, sorry, but itâs in Chapter 1.)</p>

<p>I guess you could try to view this as proof that the baby <em>was</em> deformed, in that the lady doth protest too much.  But thenâ¦ are you really going to argue for the morality of paparazzi?</p>

<p>Betty Gow, the baby&#39;s nurse, testified that the child was in perfect health.  His mother said the same, and her diaries confirm it.  Everyone who ever saw the baby or was in contact with him everyday says he was normal.  He hit his milestones.</p>

<p>The baby did have a cold on the day he was kidnapped.  But that was it: a normal cold that normal children get.  Betty Gow rubbed Vickâs on his chest before she put him to bed.</p>

<p>So, which is more likely: the baby was hideously deformed with no evidence of this, or paparazzi are just evil, merciless creatures who wouldnât leave the Lindberghs alone?</p>

<p>The baby had one deformity, so tiny that it didnât impact anything: two of his toes overlapped.  It wouldnât prohibit him from walking or anything.  He just had funny-looking toes.  This was part of how they identified the body.  You can see it in the pictures of his corpse.  I donât recommend looking them up, but you do you.</p>

<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The evidence is incontrovertible: Hauptmann did it.  Whatever claims youâre going to make, he has to be in on it.</p>

<p>Was Charles Lindbergh a nasty little eugenist?  Yes, but I hate to break it to you: it was the 1930s.  A lot of people were.  It was considered the âenlightenedâ stance at the time.  You know who else supported eugenics?   <a href="https://time.com/5918660/helen-keller-disability-history/">Helen Keller,</a> I shit you not.   Liking Nazis (again, not unpopular at the time: <a href="http://new.wymaninstitute.org/2004/01/special-feature-hitler-in-homes-gardens/">Hitler appeared in <em>Homes &amp; Gardens</em> magazine in 1938</a>) does not mean Lindbergh murdered his son.</p>

<p><strong>Hereâs the truth: the crime wasnât that hard to do.  All you needed was eyes, maybe binoculars, and a ladder.</strong>  Hauptmann just got lucky.  And honestly?  Not that lucky.  It was the 1930s.  There wasnât any security.  Just a big old house in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Lock your windows, kids.  Good night!</p>

<p>And other information I am intentionally leaving out and trying to focus only the directly relevant information</p>

<p>I like to believe I did the best I could here but I acknowledge that this write up could possibly be improved upon)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/x43bgC8.jpg">Zhu Ling</a> was born on November 24, 1973, in Beijing, China to an intellectual family. Her father was a senior engineer at the National Seismological Bureau of China and she had an older sister who was a biology student at Peking University. Her parents both met in 1959 while studying in the Department of Geophysics of the University of Science and Technology of China. Tragically her sister disappeared in April 1989 after falling off a cliff while on a spring excursion to Nansanpo with classmates. Her remains were found three days later and her death was ruled as accidental. Zhu was admitted to Tsinghua University in 1992. and majored in Physical Chemistry. She was described as a bright student and very versatile as along with her chemistry knowledge she knew how to play musical instruments and was also on the swim team.</p>

<p>Starting in October 1994, Zhu twice began to suffer from temporary blindness and blurred vision in both of her eyes for several days and underwent eye examinations at both the university hospital and Peking Medical College both of which didn&#39;t look for the cause of her eye problems and just treated the issue. On November 24, 1994, Zhu started to suffer from more severe symptoms. At first, she had severe stomach pain and couldn&#39;t eat. On December 5 her stomach comfort only got worse. By December 8 her hair began to fall off and on December 23 she was finally admitted to a hospital.</p>

<p>Upon examination, the doctors found that her arsenic and mercury levels were normal and so were her imaging and endocrine examinations were also normal but her nail folds showed severe microcirculatory abnormalities. While in the hospital she was treated with nutritional support and traditional Chinese medicine and this worked as her symptoms went into remission and her hair started to grow back. The doctors could not find a cause for her condition but she was discharged from the hospital on January 23, 1995, in good health.</p>

<p>On February 20, 1995, Zhu returned to the university after winter break ended and started her new semester. She wouldn&#39;t get far in her studies as on February 27 she began to develop severe pain in her legs. On March 8 the pain returned and worse than before as she was suffering from severe leg, foot and calf pain. It was so bad that Zhu tried her hardest not to touch anything but the pain only worsened and now included her waist. On March 9 she was brought to a special neurology clinic at the Union Hospital where the doctor stated that her symptoms were likely thallium poisoning. When she was admitted she was able to speak clearly but her hair had begun falling out again and touching her on any of her extremities would cause immense pain. Her fingertips and soles were a red colour, she had a high temperature, decreased tactile sensation below the fingertips and knees, symmetrical knee reflexes, low ankle reflexes and obvious Mees lines on her fingers nails. Since Zhu had no prior documented experience with Thallium poisoning and the hospital was unable to conduct any tests no tests were performed to confirm this diagnosis and instead just focused on the treatment.</p>

<p>On March 15 she was admitted to the neurology ward of the Union Hospital now suffering from &quot;alopecia, abdominal pain, joint and muscle pain, bilateral lower limbs distal pain, vertigo and abdominal. Before they could try and diagnose the source of her new symptoms they rapidly got worse as she now started to suffer from chest pain, distorted facial muscles, slurred speech, choking on water and respiratory distress. The doctors tried many different techniques for treatment including antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and albumin injections.</p>

<p>On March 20 Zhu fell into a coma. On March 23 Zhu began to suffer from central respiratory failure and was given a tracheotomy. On March 24 they began treating her with plasma replacement therapy and by April 18 she was given the treatment a total of seven times, each time at 1400-2000 ml, amounting to a total of 10,000 ml of plasma which played an important part in keeping Zhu alive although she contracted hepatitis C during the treatments. On March 28 she suffered from a complication of left-sided pneumothorax and was admitted to an ICU unit and placed on a ventilator.</p>

<p>On April 10 her classmates sought help via the internet by recording, writing down and documenting all of her symptoms and then translating them into English and emailing them out to various sources, hospitals, newspapers and websites abroad. This was seen by many most notably a doctor working at a Chinese embassy in the U.S. and a Chinese doctor living in California. The email got 2,000 replies from 18 different countries and various foreign doctors contacted the hospital and gave the diagnosis of thallium poisoning. The hospital, however, rejected their advice and diagnosis.</p>

<p>On April 28 Zhu&#39;s family obtained urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, fingernails and hair in secret with a doctor from the hospital sympathetic to their plight and sent them to the Beijing Institute of Labor Health and Occupational Disease Prevention and Control for testing. The results showed that she had suffered from a dose &quot;thousands of times greater&quot; than the normal limit for healthy people and that it had happened twice. They ruled that with such a high dose she was likely poisoned intentionally. After the diagnosis was confirmed the hospital was forced to relent and foreign doctors from around the world went to the hospital to take part in her treatment.</p>

<p>After the thallium poisoning diagnosis was confirmed Zhu started being treated with Prussian blue. On May 9 Zhu&#39;s platelets dropped to 40,000/mm3 and hemodialysis had to be stopped. Her thrombocytopenia only improved after a blood transfusion. On May 11 Zhu began to suffer from diarrhea and blue sweat. On May 16 her hemodialysis treatment resumed. On May 22 hemodialysis treatment was halted completely and the doctors only used Prussian blue. On May 23 her facial expressions despite her coma started to change in reaction to foreign stimuli indicating that she may be slowly starting to wake up.</p>

<p>Zhu woke from her coma on August 31, 1995, however, her central and peripheral nervous systems were severely damaged due to the duration of her coma and the poisoning. At first, she could speak only a little and was able to recall memories from earlier in her life but her arms and muscles were still weak. The damage, however, was much more severe as she later <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qGXZb1W.jpg">became nearly blind, could not speak, could barely care for herself and had the IQ and mental state of a 6-year-old</a>. She was discharged from the hospital in November 1995. To this day her faculties have never been restored and she requires constant care from her parents and relatives.</p>

<p>During Zhu&#39;s treatment her case would be reported to the police on May 5 as she had no prior experience with thallium and the high levels indicated that she had been deliberately poisoned and that it was likely criminal in nature. The police went to search Zhu&#39;s dorm and were told that at some point between April 28 and May 7, there had been a robbery and several of Zhu&#39;s personal belongings like her contact lens cases, lipstick, shampoo, bath soap and water glasses had all been stolen.</p>

<p>The police compiled a list and found that In Beijing only 20 units needed thallium for their work and only 200 people had access to thallium so therefore the suspect list would be quite small. The police visited every single unit in the city and interviewed 130 people at the university who Zhu consistently interacted with. Eventually, the police singled out a woman named Sun Wei as their main suspect.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/j6aFeQE.png">Sun Wei</a> was born on August 20, 1973, and was a classmate of Zhu and one of her three dormmates. Despite her getting along well with Zhu by all accounts, she was the police&#39;s only suspect based solely on the fact that she had official access and permission to have thallium when all of the other students didn&#39;t and university staff heavily talked up their security and how no one without permission could steal any. The police took no action against Sun due to a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1997, Chinese law was amended and it gave the police the power to summon suspects for interrogation without actually arresting or detaining them and that they could question them for 12 hours. The police took advantage of this and on April 2 they issued just such a summons to Sun. The police questioned Sun for 8 hours straight and made her sign a document where she would acknowledge that she was a suspect. After those 8 hours passed Sun was never questioned again since her family showed up to bring her home. Said family consisted of her father  Sun Yueqi who was an important member of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference as a senior leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and her first cousin was once the deputy mayor of Beijing. With many suspecting that these connections were used to to remove Sun from suspicion however, the police deny this and continue to claim that Sun is the main suspect in the case. Especially since the family only showed up right after the police confronted her with the fact that she checked out books about Thalium prior to the poisoning. On August 25, 1998, the police close the case and labelled it as unsolved.</p>

<p>Sun would comment on the case in 2005 explaining online that the police cleared her of any suspicion (which the police deny and state she is still a suspect) and that she was innocent and had no motive to poison Zhu. In 2013 she added that she wanted the real culprit to be found. Sun Wei changed her name to Sun Shiyan, changed her legal date of birth, married an American man, acquired a green card and moved to the United States. A White House petition to get Sun deported or arrested was started in 2013 and gained 143,000 signatures but nothing came of it. Sun Wei&#39;s former classmates also stated that Sun did have a motive as Zhu recently defeated her at a student election and that Sun was rude in general.</p>

<p>In 2013 new suspects would emerge as Wang Yifeng one of Zhu&#39;s old classmates would drop a very important piece of evidence. Sun was not the only one with access to Thalium. Although Wang still pointed to Sun as the main and most likely suspect she still revealed that there may be others. The Thalium solution used to help teachers do experiments was already prepared by other students on a table. And it was due to this that 7 had access to Thalium as opposed to just one. Two teachers Li Longdi and Tong Aijun, three female graduate students named Chen, Zhao and Zhu, and two undergraduate students a male named Wu and Sun Wei herself and that students in general were free to enter for experiments if one was happening.</p>

<p>On September 26, 2013, Zhu&#39;s family received a mysterious letter and this letter further opened the door to the possibility of more suspects. Zhu&#39;s family received a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/R6Bo44V.jpg">letter</a> signed on May 31 and mailed on June 4. The letter was written in Los Angeles and mailed to her family in China from Las Vegas. The anonymous sender of this letter alleged that Zhu was a bully and that all of her roommates/classmates collectively poisoned Zhu together as revenge for 2 years worth of intentional sleep deprivation. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Tk6ndjX.jpg">The full text of the letter is as follows.</a> (I ran the letter through DeepL and did correct and clarify some things but I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s still hard to follow)</p>

<p>&quot;To Zhu Lin&#39;s Parents:</p>

<p>Recently, the community has been speculating about your daughter again. As a person who knows a little, I always feel that your daughter is at fault first. If she hadn&#39;t made noise, disturbed other people&#39;s rest, and hurt people, discriminated against foreigners (It&#39;s unknown if this means non-Chinese or not as people from other provinces are also referred to as &quot;foreigners) and other annoying vices, she would not have been poisoned and maimed collectively by her fellow dormitory members.</p>

<p>The main thing in life is karma, one&#39;s own evil cause bears the evil fruit today. She had been affecting the sleep of others for more than two years, the dormitory was in a state of semi-collapse, and could not tolerate it any longer, They only wanted to expel her from the dormitory, to send her to detention, she was poisoned, purely by accident. In their own words, if this continues, we will all get a nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>In addition, there was a case here in Los Angeles, a man because of the neighbours creating a variety of noise that he could not sleep, repeatedly protested to each other to no avail, so, with a gun he killed them. The court sentenced him (Origin of Labor Day: On May 1, 1886, workers in Chicago had to work 14 to 16 hours a day, some even up to 18 hours, but the wages were very low. As a result, more than 200,000 workers went on strike to fight for their legal rights. The workers raised a strike slogan, demanding an eight-hour workday. After a hard and bloody struggle, the victory was finally won.) Not guilty, not a day in jail. If your daughter&#39;s case was in the U.S. and it ended up in court, it&#39;s highly likely that these people who poisoned her would have escaped justice as well. With enough justification, they can get away with it.</p>

<p>To sum up, everything has a cause and a consequence, your daughter is wrong in the first; they repeatedly complained to the dormitory management, and Tsinghua University did not act wrong in the second; the few people who poisoned N times, N programs, before the next step, is wrong in the second. All three parties are at fault. If they really wanted to harm your daughter, the first time you can poison her down. Because the first time was ineffective, the second time only increased the measurement, the result is unexpected, and this is not the result they wanted. They just wanted to make your daughter sick and repeat the year so they could sleep well for two years.</p>

<p>The people involved in handling the case back then, including the management of Tsinghua University and the vice chairman of the CPPCC, all advocated downplaying the situation, not wanting to look deeper, and not wanting to ruin the future of the other three people because of your daughter&#39;s fault, and anyway, no one was killed. Now it&#39;s a few years later, everyone is living in peace and quiet. I suggest that you do your daughter a favour and let these three people who almost got a nervous breakdown because of your daughter live well. If the whole world knows that your daughter is a public nuisance in the dormitory, will you and your wife have shame? I just hope that in the next life, you don&#39;t have children who are selfish, don&#39;t get along, don&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings, and have no sense of public morality.</p>

<p>The internet describes how good your daughter is, but I don&#39;t see how good she is. A person who does what she wants, who speaks badly, who doesn&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings, who affects other people&#39;s sleep for a long time, has nothing to do with excellence. I am a district student, honour student, long-time student leader, can not understand your daughter&#39;s behaviour, and have never met such people.</p>

<p>Everything in life is cause-and-effect, and one&#39;s blessings and disasters depend on the causes one plants, i.e. good causes and good consequences, and bad causes and bad consequences. If your daughter had kept her rest time, not bothered others, respected her classmates, and had good relations with her dorm mates, how would she have had such a miserable fate today? Your daughter has failed so much as a human being that she has ended up in this situation.</p>

<p>If there is an afterlife, you and your wife should first teach your daughter how to behave, how to respect people, how to get along with people, treat people generously, do public service, and become a person who can contribute to the country and even the nation. That is true excellence.</p>

<p>Monterey Park, Los Angeles, USA</p>

<p>May 31, 2013&quot;</p>

<p>No official/formal response to the letter was made by Zhu&#39;s family. The letter was handed over to the police who were unable to find the anonymous writer. The only thing known about the letter aside from its contents, date and where it was written and mailed from is that it was written on  A4 paper which is not very common in the United States.</p>

<p>Regrettably trail mostly goes cold from this point. Zhu is still alive and will turn 50 this year although her condition hasn&#39;t improved since her discharge from the hospital in 1995. And as for the poisoner? despite the case being open for and investigated for 4 years before being shelved and the revelation that there may be other suspects the police only ever looked into Sun and didn&#39;t consider other suspects. Is Sun guilty, was she just scapegoated, or is the letter accurate and Sun may have just been one of the many dormmates who took part? The answer will likely never be known.</p>

<p>Although the poisoner escaped justice Zhu&#39;s family still got some compensation. In December 1999 a lawyer named Yu Rong represented Zhu&#39;s family free of charge and filed a lawsuit against the hospital that treated Zhu. They argued that their misdiagnosis, treatment for the misdiagnosis, refusal to carry out tests for Thallium poisoning, refusal to provide test samples for them to conduct their own tests, doubting the test results when they got a test done in secret and refusal to use Prussian Blue for several days after the test results in favour of blood transfusion and hemodialysis caused Zhu&#39;s hepatitis C as well as causing her current condition after waking from her coma. The case was heard by The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#39;s Court and on November 26, 2000, they sided with the family and found the hospital liable and at fault ordering them to pay 100,000 yuan in compensation.</p>

<h2>Surviving the Unsurvivable: How can some people recover from rabies after developing symptoms? And are there some who can survive infection unharmed without medical intervention? Medical Mystery</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(201)">View full post</button><div id="201" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rabies is a disease which terrifies people - and for good reason. The rabies virus (scientific name <em>Rabies lyssavirus</em>) is a single-stranded RNA virus which can be carried by any warm-blooded mammal, although some are much more susceptible than others. It exists in over 150 countries and on five continents (Antarctica is of course clear, but Oceania also hosts no rabies virus, only related lyssaviruses). The virus travels along the nerves of the host until it reaches the brain, causing physical and behavioural symptoms and, before too long, death.</p>

<p>(Note: I will be giving all dates using BCE/CE, even if in the scientific papers they are sometimes given as years before present, for consistency.)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Background - The Science of Rabies</h1>

<p>Rabies is a <strong>disease</strong>, a set of symptoms and signs affecting a person. It is most commonly caused by the rabies virus, but the same signs and symptoms can also come with infection from other, closely related, lyssaviruses. Think of it like the common cold - multiple similar viruses produce the same outcome for the people or animals infected. Because the disease was named and described well before we even knew what a virus was, and because treatment and prognosis is often the same, it doesn&#39;t serve us well to split it up further.</p>

<p>Research is ongoing as to where and when rabies originated. Currently, most fingers are pointing at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123870407000123?via%3Dihub">bats</a> as the source animal. This isn&#39;t actually surprising - bats make up 25% of all mammal species, they live in large and densely populated colonies, and they have an incredibly powerful and effective immune system which stops them from getting sick much of the time. With the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2019 onwards, there has been increased study in this area, and some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025585/">interesting results</a>.</p>

<p>But researchers are still uncertain of the when or the where. Estimates of the age of lyssaviruses still range widely, with research on the rabies virus specifically indicating that it a sort of rabies virus may have evolved in bats in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5231386/">around 5000 BCE</a>, with current carnivora strains dating back <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC115054/">888 to 1,459 years</a> (542 CE to 1113 CE). But historical evidence (I&#39;ll discuss that shortly) exists for rabies in dogs some 4,000 years before present, indicating that there have been multiple, possibly even many, times that the virus has spilled over from bats to carnivora (dogs, foxes, raccoons, etc).</p>

<p>Bats are still the main hosts of lyssaviruses worldwide, and most of the viruses have so far only been found in bats. The rabies virus is the exception; it is able to infect many different mammal species, and in laboratory environments has been shown to be able to infect birds, as well as cell cultures of birds, reptiles and insects. But its main hosts are bats (still) and members of the mammal order <em>Carnivora</em>, especially the <em>caniforms</em> - dogs, raccoons, foxes, skunks, wolves and coyotes - but also cats and mongooses.</p>

<p>(Opossums, because of their lower body temperature, are also resistant to rabies. Smaller animals such as rabbits/hares and rodents generally do not survive the sort of bite that would infect them.)</p>

<p>Rabies infection occurs when the saliva of an infected animal gets into an open wound, mucus membrane (nose, mouth), or the eyes. The virus enters the host&#39;s cells and multiples. What makes lyssaviruses unusual, however, is that they are <strong>neurotropic</strong>, meaning they can infect nerve cells - something which (luckily) relatively few viruses are capable of doing. Because nerve cells (specifically axons) are so long, they have mechanisms for moving resources along them (axonal transport), and rabies takes advantage of this to move, slowly and inexorably, towards the brain.</p>

<p>This movement makes up the incubation period of the virus. It has been recorded as taking as little as seven days, or as much as six years, but usually takes one to two months. Along the way, it might cause pain with no obvious cause, but often has no symptoms at all.</p>

<p>On reaching the brain and meninges (the membranes around the brain), the rabies virus begins to multiple in earnest. The first symptoms are usually a high fever (up to 107Â°F or 41.7Â°C) and headaches. As the disease progresses, it causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and/or meningitis (inflammation of the meninges), which can cause confusion, agitation, paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety or feelings of terror, or even partial paralysis. Finally, the disease progresses to delirium (acute confusion), coma, and death. Death generally occurs between 2 and 10 days in carnivora or human hosts.</p>

<p>Agitation and fear are seen in around 80% of carnivora (and human) infections; this is called &quot;furious rabies&quot;. The remaining 20% are called &quot;dumb rabies&quot;, which causes loss of sensation, muscle weakness, and eventual paralysis which also leads to coma and death. This form of rabies is not the one most people recognise, and may be underreported.</p>

<p>The famous symptom of apparent hydrophobia (fear of water) in humans in fact comes from an inability to swallow - when attempting to do so, the throat spasms and tightens. This also prevents the host from swallowing their own saliva, leading to drooling and foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>The rabies virus also enters the salivary glands, where it reproduces in great numbers and is expressed into saliva. Agitation and other effects of the encephalitis regularly cause aggressive behaviour including biting. And so the cycle continues.</p>

<h1>Background - The History of Rabies</h1>

<p>Rabies (in particular &quot;furious rabies&quot;) is a distinctive disease, and despite the relatively long incubation period it seems that people figured out early on how the disease was passed on.</p>

<p>Dogs have been with humans for tens of thousands of years. They diverged from wolves around 38,000 to 18,000 BCE; there are disputed archaeological finds from 34,000 BCE and secure ones from 12,200 BCE. But throughout the historical record there has been a distinction between domestic pets and working dogs - appreciated, respected, even loved - and dangerous feral dog populations that were associated with disease, death, and carrion. And it seems that rabies was part of the reason for that fear.</p>

<p>Eshnunna was a city-state in Mesopotamia which was inhabited from around 3000 BCE to 1600 BCE. Throughout its existence, it was considered part of various empires (Sumerian, Akkadian, Subartuan), but city-states always retained some autonomy and were able to create their own laws. A pair of stone tablets known as the Laws of Eshnunna, dating to c. 1770 BCE (with copies citing a source from c. 1930 BCE) say</p>

<pre><code>âIf a dog becomes rabid and the ward authority makes that known to its owner, but he does not watch over his dog so that it bites a man and causes his death, the owner of the dog shall pay forty shekels of silver; if it bites a slave and causes his death, he shall pay fifteen shekels of silver.â
</code></pre>

<p>The word &quot;rabid&quot; has also been translated as &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;vicious&quot;, but the distinctive feature of the bite makes it likely this does refer to rabies. Various &quot;incantations&quot; (written forms of spoken incantations or prayers) against or regarding dog bites with &quot;venom&quot; are <a href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789004496293/B9789004496293_s017.xml">attested to</a> from the same period.</p>

<p>This is the oldest known historical evidence of rabies, but far from the only one. The <em>SuÅrata samhita</em>, an Ayurvedic medicinal text likely written between 1 and 200 CE (but heavily edited somewhere between 500 and 1000 CE, and yet reputedly collecting the wisdom of an ancestor who lived in 1000 BCE or earlier) gives a detailed description of the symptoms of rabies in carnivora or in humans, recognises hydrophobia as a uniquely human symptom, and a sign that the disease will be fatal.</p>

<p>In Ancient Greece, rabies was called <em>lyssa</em>, the word also used as a metaphor for inhuman bouts of rage among mythic heroes. Aristotle (384-322 BCE) thought that humans (and perhaps elephants) were immune to rabies. A series of writers show an improved knowledge - Aulus Cornelius Celcus, Themison, Eudemus - until eventually the physician Soranus of Epheseus (fl. 1st or 2nd century BCE) gave detailed descriptions of symptoms and stated firmly that once symptoms appeared, the disease progression was short.</p>

<p>The Babylonian Talmud (written c. 500 CE, or 4260 in the Hebrew Calendar, and edited for another couple of centuries) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1081547/pdf/medhist00119-0100.pdf">references attempted treatment</a>, but elsewhere says that rabies is always fatal and that a rabid dog is one of five animals so dangerous that it is permitted to kill one even on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Saint Hubertus, or Saint Hubert, c. 656 to 727 CE, was said to have cured a man with rabies. He was declared a saint in 1744, with this cure considered to be one of his miracles (acknowledging that rabies was incurable at the time). He is not the only saint said to have cured someone of rabies, but he became the best known and the patron saint of rabies sufferers. Into the twentieth century, &quot;St. Hubert&#39;s Key&quot; was tried for a cure - a bar, nail or cross used to prick the forehead of the person, then heated and placed where the bite had occurred.</p>

<p>Writers on medicine from the Islamic Empire - al-RÄzÄ«, Ibn SÄ«na and Ibn Zuhr - wrote on rabies with mixed accuracy. Jewish philosopher and physician Moses Maimonides was more correct, identifying that symptom onset might be delayed by a month, and that by the time symptoms appeared there was nothing that could be done. In this, he was correct - more than three thousand years since it was first mentioned in writing, there was still no treatment for rabies.</p>

<p>It was not until the twentieth century, with the development of vaccines for humans and dogs (see below) that human infection from bats could truly be identified. Spanish colonist Oveido (in full  Gonzalo FernÃ¡ndez de Oviedo y ValdÃ©s) wrote in 1535 about &quot;poisonous&quot; vampire bat bites, and by the early 20th century it was known that vampire bats fed of cattle and this was rumoured to cause &quot;peste de cadeiras&quot; (lit. plague of chairs) where cattle would lose power over and sit on their hindquarters, salivate excessively, and eventually die to ascending paralysis. But it was not until 1916 when an epidemiological study indicated vampire bat and a fruit bat was positively diagnosed with the disease.</p>

<p>Louis Pasteur began his research into rabies in 1880. Unable to isolate the virus - because it was smaller and less stable than a bacterium - he and colleague Emile Roux instead used brain tissue from a rabid dog to infect another dog, then to infect a series of rabbits (which were easier and safer to handle). They removed and dried spinal cord tissue from these rabbits to attenuate (weaken) the rabies virus.</p>

<p>This tissue, with attenuated virus, was then injected into dogs. The dogs were then exposed to rabies, but none fell sick. In July 1885, a nine-year-old boy called Joseph Meister was brought to Pasteur, having been bitten fourteen times by a rabid dog. Knowing that each bite was an exposure, and that if infected the boy was certain to die, Pasteur and a physician friend Dr. Grancher worked together to inoculate Meister 13 times in 10 days with increasingly less attenuated (and thus more virulent) spiral cord material. Meister did not develop rabies. In September 1885, a 15-year-old shepherd named Jean-Baptiste Jupille was also treated after being bitten by a rabid dog whom he restrained to let his friends escape. He also did not develop rabies, and this time Pasteur spoke publicly about the treatment.</p>

<p>Within weeks, people were flocking to Pasteur from across Europe to be treated - and if they reached him before developing symptoms, they could be. Pasteur opened a vaccination clinic by December, which also acted as a research and teaching centre.</p>

<p>Pasteur also developed a very similar vaccine for use in dogs, allowing for animal vaccinations and preventing the spread of disease. In some places it was fantastically successful - within thirty years, for example, there was no rabies virus in the British Isles, and to this day only a small wild bat population has a related lyssavirus.</p>

<p>Similar vaccines of attenuated nerve tissue are still used in some parts of the world today, as they are cheaper and easier to produce, requiring only relatively simple equipment and being stable to transport. However, they are not as effective as later forms of vaccine, and can still have a risk of developing rabies if the virus was not sufficiently attenuated.</p>

<p>In the time since Pasteur, seven successful vaccines have been developed - two using nerve tissue, one using virus grown in duck embryonic cells and then killed before injection, and then four using virus grown in cell culture and then killed before injection. In all cases, people who are believed to have been exposed to rabies are given four (if not previously vaccinated) or two (if previously vaccinated) injections.</p>

<p>At least as important was the developing use of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). RIG can be collected from humans or from horses (horses produce more, but the RIG has a slightly higher chance of a reaction such as pain or swelling) who have been given a rabies vaccine and produced a high number of antibodies as a result. These antibodies are collected and given as soon as possible to people who have been exposed to rabies. RIG and vaccine together can produce a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455748013003210">99%-100% protection</a> against developing rabies.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>The Unsurvivable</h1>

<p>That 99%-100% protection rate has one major caveat: the RIG has to be given as soon as possible, and the vaccine <em>must</em> be given before symptoms start. Even in the 21st century, once a patient starts to show neurological symptoms it is game over - once the virus reaches the brain, the immune system has lost.</p>

<p>Rabies is estimated to cause between 40,000 and 60,000 deaths a year. Around 80% of these deaths are in Asia, with another 15% in Africa. Over 40% of the deaths are in children under the age of 15, likely due to a number of factors including lack of education and awareness, physical vulnerability, and how children enjoy playing and exploring wilder areas.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 99% of human rabies cases worldwide are caused by dogs. However, in the Americas this is reversed, and almost all cases are caused by bat bites. Bat bites are smaller, with people sometimes not even realising that they have been bitten, which can lead to a delay in treatment - and as we&#39;ve seen, with rabies it is all about the delay.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>The Survivors</h1>

<p>Before I list known survival cases, I want to make a note about the vaccine that I think could be important here. The rabies vaccine is highly unusual in being given <em>after</em> exposure (except for some individuals in high-risk jobs who may be proactively vaccinated), and it works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies <em>work</em> - what the vaccine does is get them into production before the virus has time to reach the brain. RIG is an even more immediate way of doing this. So the vaccine shows that the human body has the capability to counter the rabies virus in certain circumstances - it&#39;s just that those circumstances have to be carefully controlled.</p>

<li>In 1970 in Ohio, US, a 6-year-old boy named Matthew Winkler was woken on October 10 by a bat biting his thumb. He was taken to the doctor and given vaccination - but not RIG. By October 30 he developed neck pain, then fever and dizziness; by November 4 he was in hospital. He became markedly uncooperative, developed muscle weakness and cardiac irregularities, and entered a coma. By the end of the month, he had exited it, was sitting up and making deliberate sounds, and over the following weeks began to speak and to walk again. With speech and physical therapy, he was discharged from the hospital on January 21 1971, deemed &quot;normal in both voice and intellect&quot;. In their write-up, his clinicians concluded that &quot;aggressive supportive care&quot; was the only significant factor they could see for the boy&#39;s survival. (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-76-6-931">Case report</a> - Annals of Internal Medicine)</li>
<li>In 1972, a 45-year-old woman in Argentina was bitten by a dog which died shortly afterwards. She began a course of vaccines, but before completing it developed tingling in her arm, fever and weakness. Despite remaining very ill for some 75 days, she later made a &quot;nearly complete&quot; recovery by September 1973. (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-85-1-44">Case report</a> - Annals of Internal Medicine)</li>
<li>In 1977, a 32-year-old laboratory worker in New York was infected when he inhaled modified live virus being aerosolised by a faulty piece of laboratory equipment. The worker had been fully vaccinated some years previously and received annual boosters, but developed symptoms and was in a coma for some days before beginning recovery. There is not much available on this case. (<a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/221447/WER5230_247-248.PDF">Case report</a> - WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report)</li>
<li>In August 1992, a 9-year-old boy in Mexico was severely bitten by a rabid dog. He was given vaccination, but no RIG, and began to develop symptoms shortly afterwards. He spent time in a coma and on a ventilator, but after approximately one month began to show signs of increased awareness. He recovered the ability to breath on his own, and later to eat, and his original quadriplegia was starting to show signs of improvement (in the form of involuntary muscle movements) by the time the report was published in December 1994. However, this has been described as a &quot;partial recovery&quot; only, and he clearly faced severe effects. (<a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Citation/1994/12000/PARTIAL_RECOVERY_FROM_RABIES_IN_A_NINE_YEAR_OLD.20.aspx">Case report</a> - Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal)</li>
<li>In 2001, a 6-year-old girl in India had been bitten by a street dog. 20 days later, showing neurological symptoms, she was hospitalised and given the rabies vaccine (but no RIG). She was at first semi-conscious and somewhat responsive, but entered into a coma shortly afterwards. She remained in a coma for three months, then spent another three months in hospital before discharge. This is again described as a &quot;partial recovery&quot;. (<a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(02">Case report</a>90144-X/fulltext) - International Journal for Infectious Diseases)</li>
<li>In October 2004, a 15-year-old girl named Jeanna Giese was hospitalised with fatigue, vomiting, vision disturbances, and lack of coordination. She was soon sedated and intubated (given a breathing tube), and after it was revealed she had been bitten by a bat about four weeks before she was tested for rabies. It was positive. Dr. Rodney Willoughby, who had been put in charge of her care, created an experimental plan involving sedation and broad-spectrum antivirals. She was in a coma for a week, then gradually regained consciousness and physical control. She went home, in a wheelchair, on January 1 2005, and underwent two years of intensive physical therapy to learn from scratch how to walk and talk. In 2011, she graduated university with a degree in biology (studying the fungal diseases of bats) and maintains social media handles to support rabies awareness. She married Scott Frassetto in 2014 (she is often now listed as Jeanna Giese-Frassetto) and gave birth to twins in 2016 and a third child in 2018. She is considered the first person to have survived rabies without any vaccine treatment; the treatment used for her is now called the <strong>Milwaukee Protocol</strong>; a later modification is called the <strong>Recife Protocol</strong>.</li>
<li>Four more individuals treated with the Milwaukee Protocol between 2004 and 2012 managed partial recoveries. Three of them survived, but with profound neurological disabilities; a fourth survived rabies but passed away due to pneumonia before regaining consciousness.</li>
<li>In 2009, a 17-year-old girl attended the hospital with fever, photophobia and pain, and on explaining that she had come into contact with bats two months earlier while camping was tested for the rabies virus. She was given RIG and one dose of vaccine (there were concerns that more doses would be too much for her immune system) and, while hospitalised, never became seriously ill. She seems to have been fully recovered within one month. (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5907a1.htm">Case report</a> - CDC)</li>
<li>In 2011, an 8-year-old girl named Precious Reynolds from California (Reynolds is Wiyot Native American) was hospitalised following a fight with a feral cat some four weeks earlier. After a week in a coma, she awoke and made a rapid recovery, leaving hospital after only seven weeks with a slight limp and an ankle brace.</li>
<li>In 2012, a 4-year-old boy in South Africa was bitten by a rabid dog, and within three weeks was hospitalised showing symptoms of rabies. The boy had been vaccinated, but not received RIG. On discharge the patient was described as &quot;semi-conscious&quot; and remained bedbound at the time of the article in 2014. (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23120053.2016.1128151">Case report</a> - Southern African Journal of Infectious Diseases)</li>
<li>Between 2013-5, six cases of survival have been reported in India; five show significant neurological problems but one, a 13-year-old girl named Sarika, is reported to have made a full recovery. (<a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/45-days-after-rabies-attack-teen-survives/articleshow/45815352.cms">Local newspaper article</a>; <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(15">case report</a>00112-5/fulltext) of one of the other cases - International Journal of Infectious Disease)</li>
</ol>

<p>In 1972, likely inspired by Matthew Winkler, Doege and Northrup published in the Lancet a list of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(74">nine cases of reported recovery</a>91084-8/fulltext) from rabies between 1875 and 1968. Unfortunately, since none of these were confirmed in a laboratory as rabies virus (or any lyssavirus) we will never quite be sure of them.</p>

<p>It seems that there are only between 20 and 30 documented cases of people surviving rabies once the symptoms of the infection have started to appear. Around one-third seem to have managed a full or nearly full recovery, but the rest have moderate to significant symptoms and some have been left profoundly disabled. The Milwaukee protocol has also been far from a silver bullet - by 2012, out of 35 cases treated with the Milwaukee protocol, 6 had survived, with 2 making near-full recoveries. (In 2013, with 41 cases, <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/is_rabies_really_100_fatal/">it was still only 6</a>.) This is a small sample size to be working with - but for a disease previously believed to be 100% fatal, it is still one final chance.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>The Hidden Cases?</h1>

<p>But there is another aspect of rabies survival which has only more recently been documented. The history of rabies has traditionally had two significant stages - exposure and symptom onset. If a patient did not develop symptoms, it is presumed that either they were not infected, or that in the modern day they were protected by RIG and/or vaccines.</p>

<p>But could this be a logical fallacy, based on our assumption that rabies is always symptomatic? In 2010, a CDC team surveyed two villages in PerÃº and found rabies virus antibodies in 7 out of the 63 individuals tested. Only 1 of these 7 had a history of vaccination. 6 out of the 7, however, reported having been bitten by a bat at some point - and remember how, above, bat bites aren&#39;t always noticeable. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120804185302/https://www.ajtmh.org/content/87/2/206.full">Report</a> - Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, via Wayback Machine)</p>

<p>It was even noted that the level of antibodies seemed to increase with age, which some suggested was due to repeated low-level exposures over the years - exposures so small that the immune system could handle them.</p>

<p>Something which might matter here is the <strong>infectious dose</strong>. This refers to how many of a pathogen are needed to reliably infect a new host - in <em>E. coli</em> this may be as few as 100 bacteria, whereas <em>Salmonella</em> seems to need more like 1,000 bacteria. The problem is that for rabies, the infectious dose is considered unknown, even today! This is likely because it is considered so dangerous, so deadly, that experiments to find out are unethical or impossible.</p>

<p>Equally, however, it may be possible that rabies virus or other lyssaviruses can cause <strong>asymptomatic infections</strong> or symptoms which do not require hospitalisation - influenza can cause a fortnight of headaches and fever without even getting into its more severe complications, but the 2009 rabies case documented above, for example, does not seem to go significantly beyond this. Might there be infections that the body catches before it enters the nerves?</p>

<p>Several scientists note that the PerÃº study exclusively relates to bat rabies virus, and that Matthew Winkler, Jeanna Giese, the 2009 patient and Precious Reynolds were all infected by bats or a cat - only Sarika, in 2015, recovered from a dog infection. Since genetic evidence suggested that current strains of canine rabies split from bat rabies hundreds of years ago, it may be that bat rabies is less virulent, or that bats shed less infectious material (and thus case a smaller dose). It is not known whether the cat that infected Precious Reynolds was infected with canine rabies or with bat rabies.</p>

<p>The 2010 CDC study did not indicate that they had reason to believe that there was any genetic aspect to potential resistance to rabies, but it wouldn&#39;t be the only time such a genetic quirk would appear. More than 95% of people are naturally immune to Hansen&#39;s disease (formerly known as leprosy); 1% of people descended from Northern Europeans (especially Swedes) are highly resistant to HIV infection due to <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/hiv_resistant_mutation/">a mutation called CCR5-delta 32</a> which makes it impossible for HIV to enter immune cells - and may have arisen because it would also have made it impossible for <em>smallpox</em> to enter immune cells. With so much of the human genome not yet understood, is it possible that there has been a selection pressure to protect against rabies or - probably more likely - against some other disease that has left protection against rabies in its wake?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>A Final Thought</h1>

<p>For nearly twenty years, since the Milwaukee Protocol was developed, there have been arguments about its effectiveness and about whether it should be improved, scrapped, or excoriated on the public stage as a fallacy for the twenty-first century as severe as radium water or bloodletting. Supporters point out that it gives a chance of survival to those who otherwise have none, and the parents of Jeanna Giese said that they hoped she would be the first to survive but that even if she wasn&#39;t, they hoped doctors could learn how to better treat rabies. Detractors point out that it is extremely expensive, invasive, and that the majority of survivors still have profound disabilities afterwards.</p>

<p>Dr. Thiravat Hemachudha and Dr. Henry Wilde, highly-respected neurologists and vocal sceptics, point out that there is also a danger to making rabies seem &quot;survivable&quot; - for as long as it is known as fatal, people do not have an excuse to kid themselves into missing out on immediate treatment. More than that, they state that the cost of treating one patient under the Milwaukee protocol would cover something like 16,000 preventative vaccinations.</p>

<p>But if preventative vaccinations have been missed, and the person is already showing symptoms, the Milwaukee protocol is perhaps the last chance remaining of life - and that is a hard achievement to argue against.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Outstanding Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>When and where did lyssaviruses in general, and the rabies virus in particular, evolve?</li>
<li>Are there likely other cases of people surviving symptomatic rabies, without treatment, buried in history?</li>
<li>Are there asymptomatic or sub-clinical (ie minor) cases which we don&#39;t notice in the shadow of fatal ones?</li>
<li>Have bat rabies and canine rabies diverged so much that it makes a clinical difference which one a human is infected with?</li>
<li>Could there be a genetic component to resistance?</li>
<li>Is the Milwaukee benefit of so slender a chance of success that it should be refuted or rethought? Is it relevant that it was developed on a bat rabies case, when 99% of cases worldwide are canine?</li>
<li>How do some people recover fully in short times, while others need years, and many continue to have profound neurological effects to the present day?</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>(This is my first post to this sub, inspired by the HIV post earlier this week and the amazing response to one of my comments there. Hoping that it passes muster.)</p>

<h2>What happened to the first two permanent Europeans in Australia? And other weird, related things</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/HotAndColdSand </span><span class = "numcomments">95 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/zqe295/what_happened_to_the_first_two_permanent/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(324)">View full post</button><div id="324" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, there&#39;s actually two mysteries here, at least. Maybe three. And they come at the tail end of a story crazy enough to be a horror movie.</p>

<p>Back in 1629, the Dutch East India company sent its newest ship, the  Batavia, loaded with coins and treasures, from Amsterdam to its namesake city of Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia). The overall commander was Captain Francisco Pelsaert. Sadly, the good captain spent much of the voyage in his cabin, seriously ill. His first officer, Ariaen Jacobsz, was left with most of the responsibilities of the voyage. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jacobsz held some bad blood for the captain, because reasons. He soon made the acquaintance of a passenger on the voyage, Jeronimus Cornelisz. Along with the helmsman, they hatched a plan to mutiny, steal the ship and treasure, and become pirates. The helmsman crashed the ship into the reefs along Western Australia. Survivors (about 300) were evacuated to nearby small islands, as the ship broke apart and the treasure sank. Such a brilliant plan.</p>

<p>The captain and most of his senior officers left in the longboat, ostensibly to &quot;find water&quot;, although they eventually made a 33 day epic voyage to Batavia/Jakarta, where they were given another ship with the instructions to A) rescue the passengers and treasure, and B) don&#39;t lose this ship, too.  </p>

<p>Oh, all except first officer Jacobsz and the helmsman, who were thrown in a dungeon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in Australia... Cornelisz, as the highest ranked remaining survivor, assumed command of those left behind on the small island. He begins a reign of terror that would make Lord Humungus cover his eyes. His immediate concern was a group of perhaps 20 soldiers. He ordered them to a distant island to search for water, and left them stranded. Several other groups were sent to nearby islands, and left to die of dehydration.</p>

<p>Cornelisz and his followers (about 40 men) proceeded to murder absolutely anyone else, for any reason, real or imagined. He himself strangled a baby after failing to poison it. A small group of women were left alive, for reasons I have no desire to mention.</p>

<p>Then, a problem arrives. Smoke signals. From the group of soldiers, who had actually found water, along with a reliable food source of seals and seabirds. Initially ignorant of the horrors occurring and confused as to why they had not been retrieved, the soldiers were alerted to the situation by a survivor who swam approximately 10km to their island.</p>

<p>Under the impromptu command of a young private named Wiebbe Hayes, the soldiers built fortifications out of stone and posted sentries for the inevitable attack from Cornelisz and his men. There were several skirmishes over the course of perhaps a week. The mutineers had superior numbers and a small number of muskets, the soldiers had superior training and a fortified position, and were able to drive off the mutineers repeatedly, killing several. It didn&#39;t help that Cornelisz was absolutely incompetent as a commander. He got himself captured somehow. </p>

<p>During the final battle, like a scene from a movie... who should appear on the horizon but Captain Pelsaert, sailing to rescue the survivors. At this point, a mad dash for the ship occurred, to be the first to get their side of the story out. Wiebbe Hayes arrived first, and the mutineers were quickly defeated and captured.</p>

<p>Gallows were built, a summary trial was held, and Cornelisz and his cohorts had their hands chopped off before being hung. Two men convicted of lesser culpability were spared execution, and marooned on the mainland of Australia.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the story in a nutshell, sorry for the abridged version. The <strong>UNRESOLVED MYSTERIES</strong>, are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>What happened to the two marooned men, Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye? They were left probably in the area of Hutt River. This is likely the (almost) impossible mystery to solve... did they go the Robinson Crusoe route and live their days out in a treehouse? Did they join an Indigenous Australian community, or perhaps run afoul of one? Hell, did they walk ten minutes inland and get bitten by one of the 2348480428 poisonous creatures that live in that continent? It&#39;s actually not impossible that we could find out someday; remains of many of the massacre victims were unearthed in the 60&#39;s, four centuries isn&#39;t a long time in archaeological terms. </li>
<li>Whatever happened to Wiebbe Hayes? He started this as a private, probably from an impoverished family, but after his leadership was promoted on the spot by the captain to sergeant, with a further promotion to standard-bearer, and was widely regarded as a hero by his country and the company. How is it that nothing further in history mentions this clearly capable man? It&#39;s possible someone fluent in Dutch could do a more thorough search, but there&#39;s zero English language record of him after these events, which is odd. (I&#39;m aware the wikipedia page has dates of his birth and death, but they&#39;re highly contradictory and have zero sources)</li>
<li>Wild card here. What the actual hell was going on in the mind of Jeronimus Cornelisz? Let&#39;s crash the ship into a reef and sink it, so we can become pirates. Also he had the idea of starting his own kingdom with that treasure on the bottom of the ocean floor. Was he serious? An idiot? Insane? How did someone like him (with a &quot;plan&quot; that a grade schooler would laugh at) manage to convince so many people to turn Lord of the Flies?</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s my first writeup of a mystery. I hope it&#39;s allowed to be published!  Long time lurker, first time poster ^_^</p>

<button onclick="toggles(449)">View full post</button><div id="449" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In May of 1995, twenty-nine year old <a href="https://cdn.unsolved.com/wp-content/uploads/existing/une_devin_williams1.jpg?x26808">Devin Eugene Williams</a> held a job as a long distance truck driver, often hauling produce from the Midwest, to the west coast.  He was a married father of three children, raising his <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/unsolvedmysteries/images/6/6d/Devin_williams1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171007191024">family</a> in Americus, Kansas.

Devin was described as a pleasant and patient man- with a coworker saying the only times she ever saw him get irritated was when he had to wait for his truck to be loaded, as he was eager to get back home to his family. </p>

<p><strong>Memorial Day Weekend, 1995</strong> </p>

<p>On Sunday, May 28, in Arizonaâs <a href="https://peakvisor.com/photo/Tonto-National-Forest-Arizona.jpg">Tonto National Forest</a>, the silence that nature provided was suddenly interrupted by the sounds of a forty eight foot, ten ton, eighteen wheeler semi truck barreling through the remote forest road. Nearby campers, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oSPUiJc">Lynn</a> and Jack Yarrington, stated that the road wasnât large enough for an 18 wheeler, and that they only would see four wheel trucks use the road- and even then, only sparingly. Jack and Lynn claimed that the 18 wheeler continued to drive back and forth on that road at a high rate of speed, for much of the day. Other campers had a close call with this same semi truck- the 18 wheeler drove right at them, head on, nearly running them over. The campers were able to reverse in time, and get out of the way, but stated that the driver of the truck stared straight ahead, with no expression on his face- almost as if he was looking right through them, or didnât recognize anyone was in front of him, at all.  </p>

<p>Later on in the day, a group of people having a picnic stumbled on the semi truck, now stuck in a field. They left their vehicle to speak to the man standing next to the mired truck. One of the men in the group named <a href="https://imgur.com/a/dqlDYft">Charles Hall</a> asked the man how he got his truck stuck in the mud. The man replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>âThey made me do it.â</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This prompted Charles to ask him, what? And the man muttered under his breath: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>âNo, you cant help me out. Iâll never get it out of here. Iâm going to jail.â</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Charles heard the man mention jail, he thought something sinister might be going on- such as a carjacking, hostage situation, or kidnapping. Charles stated that he had wondered if there was another person in the cab of the truck, possibly holding a gun on the man. Despite the strange situation, the man made no attempt to ask them for help, nor keep them there with him. </p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, a report came into the local deputy, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XcUpqrH">Deputy Wells</a>, about a truck stuck in the heart of the forest. The deputy was confused, like the campers, how such a large truck would end up within the forest at all. When he went to investigate, he discovered the semi stuck in deep mud within a meadow. This meadow was located near Forest Service Road 137 in the Buck Springs area, nearly 20 miles from highway 87. Once Wells looked inside the truck, he discovered the cargo within undisturbed and intact- 1,200 boxes of lettuce and strawberries, with the refrigeration still running. No one was near the abandoned vehicle, and the cab was locked. </p>

<p>The deputy checked his national crime computer, and learned that there were no reports submitted for either a missing truck, nor a missing truck driver. He stated that when he peered through the window of the cab, that the inside was very clean, and there were no indications that foul play had taken place. </p>

<p>At 4pm that same day, Lynn and Jack Harrington were driving through the forest along Forest Service Road 321, when they came upon a man off the side of the road, near the trees. The man was partially kneeling on the ground, staring at a tree. The man was mumbling to himself, but they werenât able to make out exactly what he was saying. Jack asked the man if he needed any help or assistance, and the man simply said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>âIâve got to light the grill.â</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The man was holding a $20 bill in his hand, and hitting it repeatedly with a rock, as if to start a fire. The couple looked around, but didnât find any evidence of food that he may want to grill- he had nothing else with him, at all. The man then threw a rock at the coupleâs car, and they decided it was time to leave, getting in the car and driving away. This was the last confirmed sighting of Devin Williams. </p>

<p><strong>The Investigation</strong> </p>

<p>When no one had heard from Devin that day, and he was off schedule for his delivery, he was reported missing. Although those who knew him were certain that Devin wasnât the type to abandoned his truck, investigators had linked the missing man to the situation in the Tonto National Forest. Eyewitnesses weâre certain that the man acting strangely in the woods that day was the same man in the photos they were shown: Devin Williams. </p>

<p>Investigators began to track Devinâs movements leading up to his disappearance. They learned that Devin had left his home on May 23, heading west. This was a route he took many times. He successfully delivered his haul to California, and reloaded his truck for his trip back to the Midwest. Devin spoke to his boss, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/iizHcTG">Tom Wilson</a>, that evening, with Tom stating later that everything seemed normal: that Devin was on time, and everything was going seemingly well. </p>

<p>On Saturday evening, May 27, Devin made his way into Kingman, Arizona. He would phone his work headquarters for the last time, telling them that he was unable to get any sleep, but that he was determined to get back on the road. After this, Devin was meant to arrive in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday morning, but he never made it out of Arizona. </p>

<h2>Judas Iscariot is the most famous traitor in history, having turned Jesus over to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver. But did Judas even exist?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(499)">View full post</button><div id="499" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Welcome back to Historical Mysteries: an exploration into strange occurrences, phenomena and disappearances in the historical record. For more entries in the series, please scroll to the bottom.</p>

<p>Today we will explore the most famous traitor in all of history - Judas Iscariot. He is one of the twelve original apostles of Jesus Christ, and is best known for having betrayed Jesus to the authorities, an event that would kick off Jesus&#39; arrest, trial and execution (and according to Christians, resurrection three days afterwards). It can be argued that Judas therefore was not just an apostle but perhaps the most <em>important</em> apostle, being the one to set in motion this chain of events. Naturally Judas is reviled among the vast majority of Christian sects, usually being depicted as an evil man, possessed by Satan, and languishing in Hell for all eternity.</p>

<p>But while the existence of Jesus Christ is considered rock solid by every reputable historian (that is: there was a preacher named Jesus in 1st century Judea who was executed by the authorities and whose death inspired a religion called Christianity), there is more doubt when it comes to the existence of the apostles. And this includes Judas.</p>

<p><strong>THE CASE FOR JUDAS</strong></p>

<p>At first glance, it does seem that if we accept the historicity of Jesus, we must also reasonably accept the historicity of Judas using the same standard. Judas is mentioned in all four canonical gospels, an impressive record since they disagree on the names of many of the other apostles. But not Judas: each gospel firmly identifies him by name as an apostle and the traitor. Furthermore, the criterion of embarrassment is often applied in Judas&#39; case. Jesus says several times in the New Testament that <em>all twelve</em> of his apostles will be at his side on a glorious throne during the second coming - yet one of those twelve would go on to betray him, which means either Judas is intended to sit at Jesus&#39; side anyway (highly unlikely) or Jesus was simply mistaken and didn&#39;t realize at the time that Judas would be a traitor later on. If the gospels had made up Judas out of whole cloth, it would make more sense for them not to include this statement showing evidence of Jesus&#39; poor judgment in apostles. Yet, they do. According to the leading scholar Bart D Ehrman, the story of Judas&#39; betrayal &quot;is about as historically certain as anything else in the tradition&quot;. Another Biblical scholar John P. Meier concludes &quot;We only know two basic facts about [Judas]: (1) Jesus chose him as one of the Twelve, and (2) he handed over Jesus to the Jerusalem authorities, thus precipitating Jesus&#39; execution.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>THE CASE AGAINST JUDAS</strong></p>

<p>So that&#39;s that, right? Judas definitely existed and there&#39;s no controversy? Well... not quite. A small but vocal segment of scholars and critics have argued that the Judas as described in the New Testament did not actually exist. Either the character was completely made up, or perhaps there was a guy named Judas but his role as the main villain is embellished or fabricated entirely. The evidence for this is as follows. Firstly, we look at the writings of the apostle Paul. Paul&#39;s story is that he used to persecute Christians but one day - a while after Jesus&#39; death - he had a supposedly miraculous vision of Jesus and immediately converted, from then on being an evangelical and spreading the word. Paul&#39;s writings are the earliest documentation of Christianity, and predate the earliest gospels by at least 20 years. Weirdly, Paul makes absolutely no mention of either an individual named Judas <em>or</em> the fact that Jesus was betrayed in any way, shape or form! The closest he gets is 1 Corinthians 11:23-24: â<em>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was handed over  / betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, âThis is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.</em>&quot; The reason there is a slash between handed over and betrayed, is that Paul uses the vague word paradidÅmi, which could mean either concept but usually just means handed over. During Paul&#39;s time, the word prodidÅmi was much more often used to mean &quot;betray&quot;. The fact that Paul didn&#39;t use this word implies that he had no concept of Jesus actively being betrayed by someone, and was just under the impression that the Romans swung by and arrested him one night. Paul had many direct interactions with Jesus&#39; family and the other apostles, so you would think that a monumental event like a betrayal by Judas would have been communicated to him and been documented in his letters. But it&#39;s not. Furthermore, Paul mentions in his writings that a resurrected Jesus appears to the twelve apostles shortly after his execution. Wait, what? Twelve? But one of them was a traitor and it seems unlikely Jesus would have appeared to him too. Paul seems to be under the impression that all twelve apostles were loyalists who were able to commune with Jesus&#39; spirit after his execution. So there&#39;s some evidence that the earliest Christians had no awareness of this so-called betrayal, and that means it could have just been made up by the authors of the gospels to add spice and drama to the story.</p>

<p>The second piece of evidence against Judas&#39; narrative is that parts of it appear to have been plagiarized from the Old Testament. <em>Genesis</em> contains a similar story of a man betraying his brother to the authorities. And Zechariah 11:12â13 mentions that 30 pieces of silver is the price Zechariah receives for his labour. He takes the coins and throws them &quot;to the potter&quot;. So either the fact that Judas was also paid 30 pieces of silver and tried to throw them away later is the biggest coincidence of all time since it happened in the OT too... or the author of the gospel is just making this up because he really liked the OT story. Critics will allege that this means at least a huge chunk of the story is clearly fiction, so therefore we cannot assume anything about Judas is true unless we have evidence elsewhere.</p>

<p>What happened that night in 1st century Jerusalem? Was there really a man named Judas who kissed Jesus to identify him in front of Roman authorities? Is part of the story made up? Is the whole story made up? This will always likely remain an unsolved mystery.</p>

<h2>âIf something happens to us, we were murderedâ: Who killed Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/alienabductionfan </span><span class = "numcomments">532 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/ub0jee/if_something_happens_to_us_we_were_murdered_who/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(575)">View full post</button><div id="575" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Kylen Schulte (24) was depressed and recovering from an abusive relationship when her father Sean-Paul convinced her to move with him from Montana to Moab, Utah in 2019. She later credited this move with saving her life. Kylenâs aunt Bridget Calvert describes Kylen as âa true free spirit that lived for the joy in her heart, not the hatred in the worldâ but Kylenâs life had already been marred by tragedy. In 2015, her 15-year-old brother Mackeon âMackeyâ Schulte was accidentally shot to death in Billings, Montana by his close friend Seth Culver, 17. Around 2.30am on May 15, Mackeon knocked on Culver&#39;s bedroom window, trying to wake him. Culver panicked and fired a single shot through the window. The death was judged to be a âjustifiable homicide&#39;. The Schulte family supported their son&#39;s killer, who was said to be devastated. Schulteâs mother Valerie said the shooting was clearly an accident. âYou canât let your emotions get away from whatâs prudent and lawful&quot;. Kylen&#39;s father Sean-Paul hugged Culver at Mackeonâs funeral and sent him a message urging him not to throw his life away out of guilt. &quot;Mackey loved you â¦ be strong as u can, study and do pushups.&quot;</p>

<p>Sean-Paul and Kylen were on a hike in 2019 when they met Crystal Turner (38), sometimes referred to as Crystal Beck. Though 14 years older and a foot shorter than Kylen, the two women bonded over their love of the outdoors. Soon, love blossomed. On April 20, 2021, they married in a treehouse in Crystalâs home state of Arkansas. By August, they were living in their camper van in the La Sal Mountains in Utah, a popular tourist location near the Arches National Park. Kylen worked at the Moonflower Community Cooperative in Moab, where she was praised for her work ethic. Crystal worked at McDonalds but she was planning to start a new job at Trailhead Public House across the street from the Moonflower. By all accounts, they were well-liked, in love and had a good life together. âTheir love just shined bright,â Sean-Paul said. âYou couldn&#39;t help but look at them and go, âWow, whatâs going on with these two?â One tall, young and beautiful, one short and a little bit older, leathered up and toughened up. One cares about flowers and butterflies and the other cares about Harleys and medium rare steaks.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>LAST SIGHTING</strong></p>

<p>Both victims were last seen alive on August 13, 2021, at a bar called Woodyâs Tavern around 9.30pm. No one approached them or followed them out of the bar according to witnesses. They are also captured in security footage, in which they appear relaxed, talking and laughing with a female friend before returning to the table where they were sitting with a small group. However, Kylen told friends at this meeting that a âcreepy manâ had been lurking close to their campsite and harassing them. To other friends, Kylen texted a tongue-in-cheek warning that if something happened to them, they were murdered by this creepy man. Bridget Calvert confirmed this. âThey said they were going to pack up and move their campsite, that he was still creeping them out.â A friend of the couple, Kayla Borza, who was one of the last people to see the two women alive, said: âWe were just having a great time, having a couple drinks, and all they said was there was a creep [staying] next to them. And that was it.â </p>

<p><strong>DISAPPEARANCE</strong></p>

<p>The following day, Kylen and Crystal failed to turn up for work. On August 18, 2021, after the couple had been out of contact for three days, local woman Cindy Sue Hunter received a call from Sean-Paul, who now lived back in Montana, asking for help locating Kylen and Crystal. He too had heard the creeper story. Cindy Sue drove around the area, growing increasingly worried. She was still on the phone with Sean-Paul when she found Kylenâs remains in a creek. Cindy Sue feared for her safety and fled the scene. Crystalâs remains were discovered later, very close to Kylenâs. Both women had multiple gunshot wounds on their backs, sides and/or chests. Police have stated that there was no sign of forcible sexual assault but they were both undressed from the waist down. One of the women was wearing a bra that had been pushed up to expose her breasts.</p>

<p><strong>INVESTIGATION</strong></p>

<p>The couple had three vehicles: a 1987 black Ford Econoline van, a silver Kia Sorento and a Harley Davidson. All three were accounted for, along with a camping tent and a makeshift pet shelter. Their rabbit Ruth was unharmed. The Harley Davidson was still parked in town. Inside the van was a journal full of newspaper clippings, notes, phone numbers, mail and pay stubs. There was also a Bible, a damaged black Samsung Galaxy 8 and drug paraphernalia, including an electronic scale, a glass weed pipe and a plastic container with cannabis residue. Nothing initially appeared to have been stolen. The first statement made by the Grand County Sheriff&#39;s Office stated there was no current danger to the public. This was met with some criticism. Locals thought this stance was motivated by tourism, as opposed to any known facts in the case.</p>

<p>Blood, shell casings, bullet fragments and video evidence from nearby properties were gathered. A tip mentioned firearms that were stolen just weeks before Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner were murdered. One of those weapons is pretty unique and could match the unusual bullet casings found at the scene of the crime. &quot;It&#39;s a silver-colored 9 mm bullet,&quot; Sean-Paul said. &quot;It&#39;s a very specific ammo.&quot; Four casings were also found, according to a search warrant from the Grand County Sheriff&#39;s Office. An incident report from the Montezuma County Sheriff&#39;s Office confirmed that a 9 mm Turkish-made pistol was reported stolen, along with a Turkish-made shotgun and bolt-action hunting rifle.</p>

<p>On August 19th, police searched the coupleâs van, still parked at McDonaldâs. According to the search warrant, the vehicle was âunlawfully acquiredâ and âhas been used or is possessed for the purpose of being used to commit or conceal the commission or an offenseâ or âevidence of illegal conduct&quot;. Another search warrant revealed that investigators requested information from AT&amp;T regarding a specific phone number belonging to one or both of the victims, which was never recovered. Recently, in March this year, a private investigator claimed that police had obtained an audio recording from near the crime scene on which gunshots and screams can be heard. According to the PI, the audio was recorded at 11:35 a.m. on August 14, 2021, the morning after Kylen and Crystal were last seen alive at Woodyâs bar. Police admitted the audio existed and that gunshots could be heard (they did not confirm screams). They confirmed the date but would not reveal the time.</p>

<p><strong>SUSPECT</strong></p>

<p>Hours before the bodies were found, a Sheriff&#39;s Deputy made a traffic stop of a car displaying an Ohio license plate. This man behaved erratically enough to attract suspicion. He had made unwanted advances towards women in the past, on one occasion presenting a red rose to a cashier at the Moonflower Cooperative where Kylen worked. He said heâd only met Kylen once briefly and denied being involved in their deaths. The man said he often slept outdoors and provided the location. Authorities found two blankets and a jacket stained with a substance that appeared to be blood. A forensic analysis determined that the evidence was unrelated to the murders. Police suspected that the man had untreated mental health issues. He was later cleared and is no longer considered a suspect. Authorities have apparently identified several persons of interest but the Grand County Sheriff&#39;s Office doesn&#39;t seem to have a solid suspect. The audio recordings may change this, however.</p>

<p><strong>THEORIES</strong> (from least credible to most credible)</p>

<p><em>They were killed by Brian Laundrie:</em> Kylen and Crystal are often mentioned in reference to another âvan lifeâ murder victim, Gabby Petito. On August 12, 2021, one day before Kylen and Crystal were last seen alive, Laundrie assaulted Petito in front of the Moonflower. Kylen and Crystal apparently witnessed this altercation but another witness called 9-1-1. Officers identified the van near the entrance to Arches National Park and conducted a traffic stop. As we know, Laundrie later strangled Petito, but based on electronic transmission evidence, investigators have determined that neither Petito nor Laundrie were involved in the murders.</p>

<p><em>They were killed because of the shooting of Mackeon:</em> Though itâs another tragic coincidence that both Kylen and her brother Mackeon died due to gun violence, itâs probably not all that uncommon in the United States due to various factors. While I&#39;m not completely convinced that all was forgiven between the Schulte and Culver families despite their best intentions, thereâs no evidence that connects the murders of Kylen and Crystal to MacKeon&#39;s death.</p>

<p><em>They were killed due to drugs:</em> A phone belonging to one of the victims was missing. An electronic scale and pipe were recovered, along with a small amount of cannabis. There were also some pills found in the van but they were mostly ibuprofen and amoxicillin. There is no evidence that they took harder drugs or were involved in any kind of serious criminality.</p>

<p><em>They were killed in a robbery gone wrong:</em> Nothing is missing from any of their vehicles other than a cellphone. Kylen and Crystal&#39;s camp was off a remote side road. The women were also shot mostly in the back, suggesting that they were running away and probably posed little threat to the killer. It&#39;s difficult to imagine a robber murdering two women for a phone that probably wasn&#39;t worth much, but it does happen and it can&#39;t be completely discounted due to the missing handset.</p>

<p><em>They were killed by someone they knew:</em> Kylen sent texts about the creeper and discussed him in public. Maybe the women were killed by someone close to them who knew where they&#39;d be camping that night. The creeper would&#39;ve been a convenient cover. Kylen was previously in an abusive relationship with a man; I&#39;m not sure if he was ruled out, but this was years before the murders. Overall, there seems to be little known motive for this theory.</p>

<p><em>They were killed in a homophobic attack:</em> Kylen and Crystal were openly in a same-sex relationship. The cleared suspect was probed about his feelings on gay people, so police have considered the possibility. The couple shared photos on Instagram using the tags #vanlife and #wifelife, which could have made them a target to a bigoted stranger. Again, no evidence to support this - just a theory.</p>

<p><em>They were killed by an opportunist stranger:</em> They may have been chosen as victims based on a random encounter or the remoteness of their campsite rather than their identity. It&#39;s possible that they were observed at Woody&#39;s or elsewhere and trailed discreetly. At one time, police said they think the suspect left the area following the murders so probably isn&#39;t local.</p>

<p><em>They were killed by the creeper:</em> It isnât clear whether the suspect police interviewed was in fact the creepy guy the victims reported to their friends. There was only ever circumstantial evidence against the Moonflower employee with the Ohio plates. If this was the person they feared, he&#39;s probably not the killer - just a creepy guy. If Kylen and Crystal encountered a totally different creepy guy, he is yet to be identified. The motive may have been sexual despite no evidence of forcible sexual assault. </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Kylen had already overcome an abusive relationship and the untimely death of her brother. Crystal had likely endured struggles of her own. Despite this, they seem to have left a positive impression on those around them. It&#39;s tragic that they met such a horrible end, even more tragic if their case is forgotten. âWe are asking that anyone that would have been in the South Mesa area between the dates of August 13th, August 14th, and 15th, contact our office with anything they may have seen or heard,â the sheriffâs office has stated. Sean-Paul is also looking for information regarding any vehicles seen coming off forestry road 4651 in the La Sal mountains around the time of the murder.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(583)">View full post</button><div id="583" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I stumbled on this case when I was looking for mysteries with a link to academia and I can&#39;t figure out why this hasn&#39;t been resolved yet.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>

<p>The short summary is Irene White was murdered in her home in Dundalk, Ireland in 2005.  In 2017, a man named Anthony Lambe, who was a PhD student at the time of his arrest, was arrested for her murder.  Upon his arrest, he confessed to the crime and indicated that he was hired to kill Irene by a middleman who was being instructed to contract the murder by a mastermind.  Anthony Lambe did not give names for either the middleman or the mastermind.  He was found guilty and sentenced to life in 2018.  The day after he was sentenced, a man named Niall Power showed up at the Gardai Station and confessed to being the middleman in Irene&#39;s murder. Niall Power, like Anthony Lambe, did not give up the mastermind and was sentenced to life in 2019.  There have been no further arrests and the identity of the mastermind remains unconfirmed.</p>

<p><strong>The longer version:</strong> </p>

<p>Where things get weird for me is how the connections in the case are reported in the newspapers and how little is said about the alleged mastermind, any other suspect, or a possible motive for Irene&#39;s murder.  I fell pretty hard into a rabbit hole and found Irene White sister, Anne Delcassian&#39;s websites regarding her sister&#39;s murder.  Anne fought tirelessly until her death in 2019 for justice for her sister and it just seems so wrong that this case is still ongoing.  The case also feels familiar to the more famous Sophie Du Plantier case in West Cork as both are unsolved cases involving a woman being violently attacked while alone in her home, small town rumours, and a long road to justice.</p>

<p>Here is my longer summary of the case based on what I could find in the news articles and across some of the websites that Anne Delcassian seemed to maintain for her sister&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Irene White was described as beautiful, charming, kind, and well-liked in her local community of Dundalk, Ireland.  She lived in a large house named Ice House on a big plot of land next to a park.  She was married in 1998 but by 2005 was separated for at least 2 months and living apart from her husband Alan White.  She lived with her 3 children, two younger children she shared with Alan, and a teenage daughter from a previous relationship.   Irene&#39;s mother, Mo, lived in a mobile home on the property.</p>

<p>On April 6, 2005,  Irene got the children ready for their days as normal and took them to school. She spoke to a teacher at the younger children&#39;s school and then headed home to Ice House for around 9:00 am to get her day started.  She is presumed to have been in her kitchen doing the washing up while listening to the radio when an intruder entered her house. She was stabbed a total of 34 times to her front, back, and neck in a vicious attack and then left to die from injuries to her heart and lungs on her kitchen floor.</p>

<p>At around 12:30pm,  Irene&#39;s mother Mo, headed over to Irene&#39;s house for their daily cup of tea and chat.  She noticed that the back door to the house was open and was immediately alarmed.  She rushed into the house and found Irene on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood. When the gardai arrived to investigate they found bloody footprints that led to the door and over a wall into the park that was next to the Ice House.  Witnesses later corroborated the footprint evidence with reports that they saw a man who looked to be in his 30s or 40s running from the house and into a waiting dark coloured car parked with its engine revving in the nearby park sometime between 9:20am to 10:15am (conflicting reports depending on the news source).</p>

<p>As nothing was missing from the house, the gardai ruled out a burglary gone wrong as the motive for the attack and began investigating other leads. Given the level of violence exhibited in the attack, method of murder, and the short window of time between when Irene dropped her children off and when her mother would visit her for tea each day, it was assumed that the attacker knew Irene and was well aware of her routines.</p>

<p>While Irene was surprised by the killer in the attack that fateful day, in the months leading to her death she was haunted by threats to her life and was living in fear. Her family, upon finding her body and learning of her death, begged the gardai to follow up on Irene&#39;s own reports, clues left in her diary, and conversations with her friends and family.</p>

<p>Irene&#39;s sister, Anne, reported that in the months leading up to her death, Irene made 15 separate reports at the local Garda station, just a 5-minute walk from the Ice House, about threats to her life and concerns over her safety. She had two protection orders and a barring order in place at the time of her death and had disclosed issues in her home life to Women&#39;s Aid Dundalk, a charity focusing on domestic violence.  In Irene&#39;s own diary she wrote that she had been warned by a woman about a murder plot against her, felt like she was being watched, and was threatened by an unnamed party with the words &quot;I will get you, you will not know the hour of the day, but I will have an alibiâ.  She confided in a friend just 3 weeks before she was murdered that she was in fear for her life because of a specific man. Neither Anne, nor any other news outlets, directly name who was threatening Irene.  However, given the timing of Irene&#39;s separation, the involvement of the domestic abuse organization, and his relationship with Irene, I would assume Alan White was looked at by gardi here as the husband is generally always a suspect in cases like this.</p>

<p>Alan White had an alibi for the time of Irene&#39;s murder which could be corroborated by a third party, an unnamed woman, CCTV and phone records.  Interestingly, in the immediate aftermath of Irene&#39;s death, Mo and Jennifer- Irene&#39;s mother and daughter- filed an injunction to bar Alan from selling the Ice House while the investigation was being conducted.  Irene and Alan were in talks at the time of her murder to sell the house and split the proceeds.  By May of 2005, just two months later, the injunction was lifted and Alan later sold the house for 1.1 million dollars.  The house was demolished and, along with the neighboring park, planning permission was sought to convert it into a housing and community development comprising of a community center, gardens, houses, and apartments.  Alan also had a 142,000 life insurance policy on Irene, which he had taken out in 1999, a year after they were married, paid out to him in the aftermath of Irene&#39;s murder.  Alan moved the two younger children with him to Knockbridge, about 5 miles away from Dundalk, while Irene&#39;s teenage daughter stayed with her grandmother Mo.  Sadly, only 6 months later, Mo passed away on what would have been Irene&#39;s 44th birthday, and Irene&#39;s teenage daughter had to go to the legal courts to see her younger siblings. Again, while it&#39;s never explicitly stated by Anne or any of the news articles, it seems like Alan White made it difficult for Irene&#39;s oldest daughter to see the two younger children that Irene and Alan shared and was unsupportive towards Irene&#39;s family at the time of her death.</p>

<p>In 2006, Alan White and Niall Power, a business associate of Alan&#39;s and friend of the family, were arrested in connection to Irene&#39;s murder under Section 20 of the Offences Against the State Act for suspicion of withholding information.  However, they were both released without charge. At the time of Irene&#39;s murder, as far as I could tell, both Alan and Niall were directors in P.P.S Security Limited. I was only able to find two news sources that mentioned Alan working or founding P.P.S Security Limited while Niall Power is more frequently named as having founded it. Notably, an article in the Independent indicates that it was Niall Power&#39;s former girlfriend who warned Irene about the murder plot against her.</p>

<p>After Alan White and Niall Power were released without charge, there were no major updates to the case between 2006 and 2011.  Irene&#39;s family held out for answers and her sister Anne held annual memorial services for her sister.  Throughout this time, she was vocal about preventing violence against women and fighting for better justice for victims of violence.  She held special tributes to women across Ireland who lost their lives to violent crime and worked alongside other families campaigning for justice including the family of Sophie Toscan du Plantier.</p>

<p>In 2011, the case was taken over by the Serious Crime Review team, which is a national cold case team.  From there, attention to the crime and an appeal for witnesses to come forward was sought.  In July 2012 a CrimeCall special featuring the case aired on television and brought the case to the spotlight again.  In 2013, an Australian woman anonymously called the tip line for the case and implicated her former boyfriend Anthony Lambe for the murder. In November 2016, three years after the first anonymous tip, a second CrimeCall special aired featuring Irene&#39;s daughter Jennifer and the gardai finally tracked the woman in Australia down to interview her about her knowledge of the case. In her interview, the woman stated that her former boyfriend Anthony Lambe admitted to committing the murder.  The gardai then reached out to another former girlfriend of Anthony Lambe who also provided information indicating that Anthony was the suspect that they were looking for.  Interestingly, Anthony Lambe&#39;s name had been mentioned in the initial investigation in 2005 and 2006 by Niall Powers. Niall had given Anthony&#39;s name as part of his alibi of having met Anthony, his employee, to give him his wages on the day of Irene&#39;s murder.</p>

<p>On January 20 2017, Anthony Lambe was arrested in Monaghan for the murder of Irene White. Almost immediately, Anthony confessed to the crime.  At the time of his arrest, Anthony was a 34-year old PhD student studying history at Maynooth university.  During his confession, Anthony laid out that there were three parties involved in the crime: himself- the killer, the man who asked him to kill Irene on behalf of another man- the middleman, and the man who wanted Irene dead- the mastermind. In 2005, Anthony was 21, a student at Dundalk IT, and worked part-time at P.P.S Security Limited, the same firm that Niall Powers and Alan White worked in.  He admitted to being heavily involved in drugs, drink, and having debts.  He was approached by the middleman with an offer to kill Irene by stabbing her twice in the heart for 25,000 euros.  It is alleged that Anthony was introduced to the mastermind by the middleman and the mastermind gave him further instructions on when the children would be out of the house for school and how he should enter Ice House. Anthony alleges that he tried to back out prior to the murder but was convinced that he needed to go through with it.</p>

<p>Anthony admitted that on April 6, 2005 he had ecstasy, cocaine, and alcohol in his system and went over to Irene White&#39;s house with the plan to kill her.  He viciously attacked her with a knife and, after he was sure she was dead, said a prayer over her body.  He jumped over the back wall of the house and ran away from the crime scene.  Later that day Anthony called the middleman and told him the job was done.  Rather than receiving 25,000 euros as discussed, he received somewhere between 1-2 thousand euros in two payments.  He immediately boarded a plane to England with his girlfriend.  When the girlfriend was interviewed years later, she remembered that Anthony was nervous and jittery that day but had assumed he was just a nervous flyer.  He spent time living in England and Australia before returning to Ireland in 2011 where he re-enrolled in college and completed an arts degree, a masters of education, and began his PhD. It seems he lived a normal life during this period and, as evidenced from the Irish Mountain Runners website, even completed a mountain running race. He told the guards that he was traumatised from the murder and, during the first few years after, was heavily dependent on drugs and alcohol.  He claims that when he saw the 2016 CrimeCall special, he cried for 6 hours straight after hearing Irene&#39;s daughter&#39;s voice because it sounded just like Irene.  Still, at no point did he actually turn himself in or give up his co-conspirators.  During the trial they were referred to as just the middle-man and mastermind and Anthony, presumably, did not give their names up at any point after his arrest.  On the 29th January 2018, Anthony Lambe was found guilty of murder and given a mandatory life sentence.</p>

<p>The very next day, Niall Powers entered the Dundalk gardai station and turned himself in for Irene White&#39;s murder.  Through his confession, the guards learned that Niall Powers was the middleman that Anthony referred to in his trial and confession. Niall was Anthony&#39;s boss at P.P.S Security Limited and asked Anthony to kill Irene on behalf of the mastermind.  Niall, a father of 4, claimed that he was pestered by the mastermind on a daily basis from 2003 to 2005 to find someone to kill Irene White. It is understood that the mastermind paid both Niall and Anthony for their involvement.  Niall, like Anthony before him, did not name the mastermind and alleged that the man had a great power over him and used him like a puppet.  On July 8th, 2019, Niall Power was found guilty and given a life sentence.</p>

<p>Irene&#39;s sister and children attended each of the trials as did her estranged husband Alan White.  Alan claims to have not known Anthony at all but admits Niall was a friend and business associate. In 2019, Irene&#39;s sister Anne Delcassian, brought legal action against Alan White regarding Irene White&#39;s estate.  However, she passed away from terminal cancer shortly after.  While she was happy to see Anthony and Niall convicted for their roles in Irene&#39;s death, she was devastated that the mastermind and anyone else who helped the killer, middleman, and mastermind get away with the crime for so long had not been brought to justice.  Gardai claim that the arrest of the mastermind is imminent but as of 2021, the mastermind has still not been named.</p>

<p><strong>My attempts to understand who the mastermind is and what the motive was:</strong></p>

<p>So who is the alleged mastermind and third suspect in Irene&#39;s murder and why have neither Niall or Anthony named him?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s review the evidence that Alan White may have been a potential suspect.</p>

<p>First, Alan White has an alibi for the time of Irene&#39;s murder.  The alibi has been confirmed with witnesses, CCTV footage, and phone records.  The mastermind, according to Irene&#39;s diary, has always claimed that he would have an alibi when he ordered Irene to be murdered and, since we know that Anthony Lambe committed the act of murder, this should not be any surprise to us. However, the Irish Times reported in 2019 that the third suspect, the mastermind, has been a prime suspect since 2005 and has an alibi.  Other than Niall Power, the only other person who was arrested in 2006 in connection with the crime was Alan White.</p>

<p>Secondly, he has a connection through work to both Niall Powers and Anthony Lambe.  Oddly, when researching this case it seems like the news reports usually do not mention the connection.  As far as I can tell, the company where Anthony Lambe worked in 2005 and was recruited by Niall Powers to commit the murder was P.P.S Security Limited.  The company was started by Niall in 1999 and, according to an article in the Mirror in 2009, Alan White was also a director of the company.  However, by 2009 he was no longer listed as a director of the company and as of 2021 the company is listed as dissolved.  It&#39;s unknown how much of a day-to-day role Alan had in the company.  However, it does connect the three men together and weaken Alan&#39;s claims that he had no idea who Anthony Lambe was.</p>

<p>Next, the timeline of Irene&#39;s protection and barring orders align with her separation from Alan White. Alan White claims that he and Irene had been amicably separated for about 2 months from the date of the murder in April of 2005 and it was Irene who wanted to be separated, not him.  This would place their separation in February of 2005.  February 2005 is when Anne indicates that Irene received a barring order and protection orders against an unnamed individual. During this time frame, the immediate few months before her death, Irene visited the local gardai station with fears over her safety, visited Women&#39;s Aid Dundalk which focuses on helping women through domestic violence, and told multiple people that she was afraid for her life. While we can&#39;t say for sure that this was related to her separation from Alan White without seeing who the barring order and protection orders were against, statistically the most dangerous time for a victim or survivor is when she leaves her partner.</p>

<p>In terms of a motive,  financially, Alan stood to benefit from Irene&#39;s death as he wouldn&#39;t have to split the proceeds from the sale of Ice House with her and he had a 142,000 life insurance policy on her.</p>

<p>If Alan White is the mastermind, we know from Niall and Anthony&#39;s testimonies that they both were aware and had conversations with him indicating that he wanted his wife killed.  We also know that at least one other person, a woman- identified as Niall Power&#39;s former girlfriend- was also aware of the murder-plot and warned Irene about it.</p>

<p>So why won&#39;t Niall, Anthony, or anyone else name Alan White if he is the mastermind? The most popular assumption is that Alan White has too much on them and they fear for their family and friends safety or retaliation if Alan White goes to trial for the crime. I&#39;ve heard it mentioned that Alan holds some power and being from Dundalk, which is on the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland, they are not willing to name him as his reach goes beyond the gardai&#39;s jurisdiction.  It could also be the case that Niall, Anthony, or Niall&#39;s former girlfriend have already named Alan White as the mastermind but the gardai are not pursuing him for the crime as they don&#39;t feel they have enough evidence to convict him on conspiracy to murder or, alternatively, Anne&#39;s theory could be correct that the mastermind is a gardai informant and they aren&#39;t willing to give him up for this crime.</p>

<p>If the mastermind isn&#39;t Alan White, who could it be? There really aren&#39;t many other suspects named in the media but that doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t exist. It&#39;s possible that there is another third party with motives to kill Irene White that we haven&#39;t heard about.  It could be possible that there was no mastermind at all and the crime was planned and committed by only Niall and Anthony.  Both men testified that they felt pressured to do it by someone else, and never really owned up to the fact that they chose to follow through and took Irene&#39;s life.  Could it be possible that they invented the mastermind to absolve themselves from some of the guilt associated with the crime?</p>

<p>So what do you think? Why isn&#39;t the case solved? Its been 16 years and Irene&#39;s family deserves justice.</p>

<h2>A religious notebook in a mysterious, undeciphered language written by a seemingly average janitor. Mystery of James Hampton and "The Book of the 7 Dispensation"</h2>

<p>Seemingly there was nothing special about James Hampton. Born in 1909, served in the Pacific during IIWW. Shortly after getting discharged, he got a janitor job at the GSA in Washington, D.C. where he stayed until his death in 1964. Lived alone in a small apartment, never got married, had only few friends, was known for being reclusive.  </p>

<p>In 1950 he rented a small garage where he worked on something very special in his free time... for 14 years. He never showed it to anyone, never talked about it. All came to light after he died of stomach cancer in 1964. The garage&#39;s owner visited the place and found it filled with religious art made of scavenged materials. Hamton&#39;s family wasn&#39;t interested in taking it back so unbeknownst of its true value he listed it for a sale in a local newspaper. Fortunately, an artist named Ed Kelly got curious and came to check it out. As soon as he saw the garage, he contacted several of his friends in art circles. One of them, Harry Lowe, who worked for Smithsonian American Art Museum, said that the experience âwas like opening Tutâs tomb.â  </p>

<p>Inside, there was a magnum opus of James Hampton life: &quot;Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations&#39; Millennium General Assembly&quot;. A complex sculpture representing a throne made entirely out of cardboard and plastic, with additional elements like found objects from his neighborhood, such as old furniture, jelly jars and light bulbs. Thematically it is a fusion of Christianity and African-American elements and it is considered as a one of the most important American examples of &quot;outsider art&quot;.  </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not all. There is a mystery. Among many other things inside the garage, a 174-pages long handwritten notebook has been found. It&#39;s titled &quot;St. James: The Book of the 7 Dispensation&quot; and parts of it give us some insight into the mind of James Hampton. He referred to himself as &quot;St. James&quot; and claimed to have experienced several deep religious visions and revelations throughout his life. Believed in the second coming of Christ at the end of the millennium and didn&#39;t adhere to any existing Christian denominations. The throne he made meant to be &quot;a monument to Jesus in Washington&quot;. However, all of this information comes from English-written parts of the notebook. The rest of the notebook is scribed in an unknown script named by scholars as &quot;Hamptonese&quot;, consisting 42 different symbols. To this day no-one managed to create any meaning out of it. There were academic attempts to use Hidden Markov Models to find out whether Hamptonese could be a substitution cipher for English but it has been ruled out with some limitations. Authors of this paper put forward a hypothesis that the Hamptonese isn&#39;t a cipher and is possibly an equivalent of glossolalia / &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, so it doesn&#39;t carry any meaning but imitates a &quot;godly&quot; language. On the other hand they have found out that Hamptonese has entropy levels âcomparableâ to that of English.  </p>

<h2>The White White Cult â In 1937, the Japanese police receive report of a young man whose entire inheritance had been stolen and his younger sister given to a cult leader as a concubine. When the police arrive at the scene, they uncover more than 300 murdered in mass graves.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(630)">View full post</button><div id="630" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Korea between the 1920s and 1930s was the perfect time to start a cult.</p>

<p>At the time, Korea was under Japanese control. Koreans were poor. They were desperate.</p>

<p>And Baek Baek Gyoâs (ë°±ë°±êµ) cult leader Jeon Yong-he (ì ì©í´) understood this.</p>

<p>The Korean Peninsula has always had gold. At the height of Japanese occupation, gold was found in amounts that pushed Japanâs gold production to 4th place in the world. With an expansion planned into mainland China (Second Sino-Japanese War), Japan needed all the gold it could mine. Gold was currency. Gold was wealth.</p>

<p>Jeon Yong-he planted gold in what were known to be exhausted gold mines. In front of the gathered people, he would âdiscoverâ the gold with his mystical abilities. Amazed, people begged to be allowed to join his cult.</p>

<p>But there was a catch.</p>

<p>In order to join, the men were required to donate their entire household wealth to the cult. If they had no money, they could offer up their prettiest daughters.</p>

<p>The women would have to have sex with him.</p>

<p>Anyone who protested or showed an inkling of discontent would be killed by his secret police.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Baek Baek Cult (ë°±ë°±êµ - ç½ç½æ - White White Teachings)</strong></p>

<p>Without straying too far into history, Baek Baek Gyo was an offshoot of Baek Do Gyo which was itself a branch of Cheondoism, a religion based on Korean Neo-Confucianism.</p>

<p><em>Cheondoism &gt;&gt; Baek Do Cult &gt;&gt; Baek Baek Cult</em></p>

<p>Baek Do Gyo was created by Jeon Jung-un (ì ì ì´) in 1900. He spent three years meditating, or rather avoiding the law, in Mount Kumgang where he supposedly achieved higher learning. He then went around convincing people that calamity would befall on the world in June 1904 and only he had the power to save them.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the world certainly did not end in 1904, Jeon Jung-un successfully cheated his followers of their wealth and eventually go on to boast 60 concubines.</p>

<p>In fact, between 1915 and 1916, his followers numbered around 10,000.</p>

<p>Jeon Jung-un died in 1919.</p>

<p>Jeon Jung-un had three sons. And the apples did not fall far from the tree. But none of them could agree who should take over as the head of their fatherâs cult. In the end, the three sons decided to go their separate ways. The eldest son created In Cheon Gyo (no relation to the city of Incheon), the middle son created Baek Baek Gyo and the youngest created Do Hwa Gyo.</p>

<p>Among the three brothers, Jeon Yong-heâs Baek Baek Gyo attracted the most followers.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Son of God</strong></p>

<p>Baek Baek Gyo meant: one manâs purity will make the heavens pure.</p>

<p>And Jeon Yong-he was that man.</p>

<p>In 1923, he created Baek Baek Gyo. He was uneducated but was charismatic and a master manipulator.</p>

<p>According to a testimony from a member of his inner circle, Jeon was good at reading people. Whenever someone felt animosity towards Jeon, he would call that person out on it and berate them. It solidified the belief that Jeon could read peopleâs minds.</p>

<p>No photograph of Jeon Yong-he exists. He would cover up his face in the presence of others, claiming that ordinary people could not withstand its power. Even the women he took as wives were forbidden to look upon his face. Outside his immediate family, very few really knew what he looked like.</p>

<p>Like his father, the younger Jeon was a fraud. He declared himself the son of god and tempted followers with promises of immortality and eternal wealth. He told followers that, though they lived in oppression, once he gathered enough spiritual energy and tithings, he would drive out the Japanese. And like his father, he also foretold the end of the world.</p>

<p>According to Jeon, at the end of the world, the west would be swept up in flames. The east would flood. If people wanted to live, there were 53 safe houses scattered across the peninsula that only he had access to. If they followed him, he would lead them to the safe houses where they could enjoy immortality and eternal wealth.</p>

<p>And people believed him.</p>

<p>Baek Baek Gyoâs followers tended to be poor farmers or laborers at a time when the population was 70~80% illiterate. Obviously, this was not ideal. He could not take money from his followers if they had no money to begin with. So Jeon handpicked a few of his loyalists to recruit the wealthy but the naÃ¯ve. He also had a side mission for themâfinding pretty girls.</p>

<p>If Jeon saw a girl that he liked, he would ask them to partake in a âgod ceremonyâ and have sex with them. If he grew tired of one, he would claim that her faith was weak and give her away to one of his loyalists. He had an estimated 60 concubines at the time of his death.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, it wasnât long before people grew discontent. The poor farmers that joined continued to be poor farmers. They realized Jeon had lied to them. To quash resistance, Jeon formed group of informants called the âowl squadâ. The owl squad were often teenagers who would observe followers and inform on them to Jeon. Jeon would then tell his inner circle to âprayâ with these individuals, a euphemism for taking them out to the woods to kill them.</p>

<p>And if the individual happened to have a child or a family, they would be buried together.</p>

<p>In 1930, the Japanese police had a chance to catch Jeon Yong-he and destroy his cult.</p>

<p>It came to light that year, his father Jeon Jung-un had murdered 4 of his concubines and buried themâamong other crimes. The police cracked down on the Jeon family hard. But Jeon Yong-he escaped.</p>

<p>Once the police closed the case on the Jeon family cults, Jeon Yong-he was free to recruit followers and cull them at whim. Eventually, if he grew tired of a woman, he killed her. If a woman got pregnant by him, he killed her. If a woman resisted him, he would kill her. If he got tired of feeding followers and felt that they were hurting his profits, entire families ended up in mass graves. If anyone disobeyed him, he killed them. If he thought someone thought to disobey him, he killed them. If he felt that police were too near, he would kill his followers to hide his presence.</p>

<p>His followers did as they were told. They believed Jeon when he told them that people needed to be killed. They were also afraid of becoming victims themselves.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Downfall</strong></p>

<p>Yu Gon-yong was from a wealthy family. His grandfather dealt in traditional medicine and due to his influence, Yu aspired to be a pharmacist.</p>

<p>But all that wealth dried up overnight.</p>

<p>It turned out that his grandfather had donated all of the money, the land, the pharmacy, and the medicine to the Baek Baek Gyo. On his deathbed, Yuâs grandfather believed that the wealth donated would return to Yu and his father hundredfold. But Yuâs father was an even more ardent believer in the cult and had no plans on reclaiming their lost fortune.</p>

<p>Yuâs father moved to Seoul, where Jeon was, and offered up Yuâs younger sister as a concubine.</p>

<p>The following is Yuâs testimony.</p>

<p>After four years of trying to convince his father that the Jeon Yong-he was a fraud, Yu relented and went to his father. It was Lunar New Years of 1937. He wanted to mend bridges. He also wanted to see his brother-in-law, the leader of Baek Baek Gyo.</p>

<p>Before Yu was allowed audience with Jeon, his sister warned him:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never look at Jeonâs face.</li>
<li>Do not carry anything in your pockets.</li>
<li>Be pure of heart.</li>
<li>Obey him in everything.</li>
</ol>

<p>At first, the meeting seemed to go well. Jeon welcomed Yu as a brother-in-law. But when Jeon asked Yu to give up everything and move to Seoul, Yu refused. Enraged, Jeon leapt at him with a knife.</p>

<p>But, Jeon estimated Yu.</p>

<p>Yu was young and he was strong. He managed to escape. Knowing that Jeon intended to kill him, Yu fled to the local police precinct requesting sanctuary. The police, realizing that maybe they didnât end the Jeon family cults in 1930, were immediately deployed to the scene.</p>

<p>By the time the police got to the temple, Jeon had already fled. The police had to satisfy themselves with arresting Lee Kyeong-deuk, Lee Soon-moon and Jang Seo-oh, all very high ranking members and members of Jeonâs inner circle.</p>

<p>What the police discovered next shocked them so much that they forbade the media from reporting on the case.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1937, Joseon Daily published âEstimate over 400 killed. 158 Identified.â</p>

<p>The police had found 314 bodies in 20 different places all over the Korean Peninsula, even in the heart of Seoul.</p>

<p>The gold mine in Cheon-po, where he tricked people into thinking he could find or even create gold, alone had 40 bodies in it. It was believed that after planting gold in the exhausted mines, Jeon had the people involved killed.</p>

<p>The pressure was on for the high grade division (Godeunggae â a division of the Japanese police specializing in the surveillance and repression of Korean population during Japanese occupation) of the Japanese police to find Jeon. Because while Jeon was clearly guilty of bigamy, fraud, murder, and robbery, his most grievous crime was his prediction of Korean independence and end of Japanese occupation.</p>

<p>Overnight, Baek Baek Gyo and its leader Jeon Yong-he became a matter of national security.</p>

<p>On April 7, 1937, the police caught up to Jeon in Yongmoon Mountain. They found a body whose face had been eaten by wild animals. In his pockets was a gold watch, which he was known to wear, and around $15 in todayâs money.</p>

<p>According to autopsy, time of death was a week prior on April 2, 1937.</p>

<p>Cause of death was ruled suicide. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, no one knew what Jeon Yong-he looked like. The police brought in Jeonâs son, Jeon Jong-gi, to identify the body. Jeon Jong-gi broke down in tears as soon as he saw the body. The police recorded the interaction as positive identification.</p>

<p>It took three years for the police to process over all the suspects and murders. Due to threats to national security, the Japanese police arrested everyone with even the slightest connection to Baek Baek Gyo.</p>

<p>The trial began on March 3, 1940. There were 4 hearings within a span of one week.</p>

<p>14 were sentenced to death for murder.</p>

<p>3 were named in the papers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kim Seo-jin who killed 170.</li>
<li>Lee Kyung-deuk who killed 167</li>
<li>Mun Bong-jo who killed 127.</li>
</ul>

<p>Others were given lengthy prison sentences.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, no one knows what happened next. There are no records of executions taking place. World War II was coming to a close. The Korean Peninsula was liberated from Japanese occupation on August 15, 1945. It is assumed that those who were given prison sentences were released and went on to create cults of their own.</p>

<p>As for Jeon Yong-he, the Japanese Empire decided to cut his head off and preserve itâin the name of science. National Forensic Service of Korea inherited the specimen after liberation and kept it until 2011, when it was cremated and given a memorial service at Bongseonsa.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>Supposedly, there are English articles out there of this case. I canât find any. The search words would be âbaekbaekgyoâ or âwhite white churchâ or âhyakuhyakukyoâ or a variation in spelling.</p>

<p>No one seems to be able to agree on the number of murders and bodies found. Japanese sources estimate up to 600. Chinese sources say 500. Korean sources agree there were at least 400 killed.</p>

<p>Dates may be off because depending on sources, lunar dates were used.</p>

<p>The body found in Yongmoon Mountain may be Jeon Yong-he. Maybe not. Regardless, the Buddhist temples thought keeping a human head in a lab, without any scientific purpose, was immoral and petitioned to have it cremated. </p>

<h2>Maryland man charged with rape and murder of Laney Lee McGadney in 40-year-old cold case. Police say they revisited DNA evidence to solve the case.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(646)">View full post</button><div id="646" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howard County police in Maryland have charged a Laurel man with rape and murder in a long-unsolved kidnapping case dating back nearly 40 years.</p>

<p>Howard Jackson Bradberry, Jr., 62, of Montgomery Street, was arrested at his home May 25 after DNA test results linked him to a 1982 crime scene where the body of Laney Lee McGadney was found. Bradberry is charged with first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree rape, and kidnapping</p>

<p>âWe hope that after nearly 40 years, Laney McGadneyâs family can have some kind of peace with this arrest,â said Police Chief Lisa Myers. âNothing will ever erase the pain of losing a loved one in such a violent and tragic way. Â Our cold case investigators are committed to bringing justice for victims and families, no matter how much time has passed.â</p>

<p>McGadney left her apartment in Columbia on March 29 to walk to a grocery store in the Owen Brown Village Center. Witnesses described seeing McGadney being abducted as she walked along Oakland Mills Road. Â Her body was discovered the same day in a vacant lot, now known as Water Lily Way. McGadney, a mother of four children, had been raped and stabbed to death. She was 28.</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, police collected evidence from the scene and conducted a lengthy investigation, but never identified the killer. </p>

<p>Since then, cold case investigators have revisited the evidence to determine whether they could identify any new leads. In early 2021, they received results of a DNA test performed on items discarded at the crime scene that linked Bradberry to the crime.</p>

<p>âI applaud the diligent persistence of our police investigators who, after 40 years, have never given up trying to solve this case,â said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. âHopefully, this arrest will bring some measure of closure to the victimâs family and all those who knew her. â</p>

<p>After obtaining additional information, police charged Bradberry in the murder. He is currently being held at the Howard County Detention Center on $25,000 bond.</p>
