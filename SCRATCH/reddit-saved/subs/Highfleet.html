<button onclick="toggles(257)">View full post</button><div id="257" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I recently discovered that with a sneaky ship you can actually catch strike groups on the ground, and bomb the hell out of them while they&#39;re immobile. Since then I&#39;ve been trying to perfect a design that balances low IR and radar signature, range, and armament. I feel like with a better design you could do much better, sending it out on long range missions to harass strike groups while refueling.</p>

<p>So, create your own designs and share them in the replies!</p>

<button onclick="toggles(321)">View full post</button><div id="321" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>okay, after digging through a lot more info on this game, i&#39;ve got more questions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some conflicting-ish info on strategy, some people say to leave the Sev hiding in the desert, while many talk about how chonk the sev is in combat. My assumption would be to leave the sev out there until i need it to face-tank SGs, but that seems inefficient right now as my lightnings struggle to deal with the escorts and <em>ptsd flash</em> missiles from cargo ship escorts. My thought here is maybe relegating the sev to a more aux role and bringing something else with more firepower along? </p>

<p>What&#39;s your typical starting fleet composition? right now i&#39;m taking the sev, 2 lightnings, 2 skylarks, a gladiator, and a longbow i feel this leaves me lacking in some options though.</p>

<p>Does anyone have good slight changes to the starter ships to improve them? the Sev thread was really good and i&#39;d like more for other ships. I get the feeling that i&#39;m kind of shooting myself in the foot by only using the default ship designs.</p>

<p>If i make a new ship, does it become available at the start?</p>

<p>How do people manage to dodge the sheer volume of fire when using the lightning? i tend to just get boxed in as the AI spreads out and surrounds me</p>

<p>How do you make use of the information from messages? i started paying more attention to them, but a solid 80% of the time i get information missing the important parts of the message, and literally last night got a message along the lines of &quot;speed 90, heading _______ for an hour, then heading ______ for an hour at speed 90&quot; which seems completely useless info since nothing is within 90km?</p>

<h2>Hi Fleet! I have questions (specifically about the current validity of various shipbuilding guides).</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/ThePlanner </span><span class = "numcomments">11 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Highfleet/comments/yqsoq3/hi_fleet_i_have_questions_specifically_about_the/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(376)">View full post</button><div id="376" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I’m new to Highfleet but very keen. I have read a lot of guides about the game, and the manual, I’ve played around with the workshop, and I’ve made a number of attempts at the campaign to ‘learn by doing’ without an intention of trying to win. With all that said, I wanted to do a bit of a hive-mind check in on the current validity of shipbuilding guides. </p>

<p>Specifically, it seems to me that the various shapes of structure all seem to weigh the same (e.g. 1x1 and 1x1 triangle weigh the same, 2x2 square/three-sided square/triangle weigh the same). From various shipbuilding guides, there was a lot of emphasis placed on weight savings using only the part configuration you need. Am I wrong, or has the game changed how weight is calculated since these guides were written?</p>

<p>Likewise, there was a lot of emphasis on using so-called composite armour (1x1 reinforced hull triangles and a triangle armour, all fitting into a 1x1 volume of space. I’ve built a number of ships with this feature and found that they just don’t hold up very well in combat. I understand that they still offer a volumetric and cost savings over a layer of solid reinforced hull and a piece of square armour, but are people still using composite armour these days, especially if it doesn’t hold up very well in combat?</p>

<p>Furthermore, I saw that some guides recommend ‘spaced armour’, in which the armour plate is held away from the hull by standoff 2x1 reinforced structure pieces. I assume this is so that area of effect explosion damage doesn’t penetrate to the soft gooey interior parts. Sometimes the standoff armour is composite, too, or composite with a full layer of plate on top. Have I understood this mechanic correctly? Does it still work? Is it worth doing?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(378)">View full post</button><div id="378" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been waging my campaign against the Gerati rebels for two days now, and while my understanding of the core Strategic principles are sound, some more esoteric concepts escape me.  Perhaps you can help me understand them.</p>

<p>1)  Flares and fire suppression canisters - these are refilled for free?  Must I make an effort to keep a few components in storage in order to recharge the systems?  Are they refilled after a battle, or only when landing at a city?</p>

<p>2)  Strike groups and strategic assets - do I hunt these or avoid them?  I&#39;ve been operating under the impression that it&#39;s my mission to kill them all, but I&#39;m starting to feel like maybe slipping past them and achieving my ultimate goal is the better endgame.  I just don&#39;t want to be stuck sitting above a giant nuclear reactor if 12 strike groups start converging on me at once as soon as I get there.</p>

<p>3)  Should I endeavor to make multiple independent strike groups of my own, or use all my resources to fortify the Sevastopol&#39;s escort as much as I can?</p>

<p>4)  Kindness.  Do I sacrifice fuel/ammo/money in order to rescue people even though it seems like there is no benefit to doing so?  Is there something later on in the game that I will regret if I don&#39;t make an effort to keep my kindness high?</p>

<p>5)  Is there a way to decide where your ships will enter a fight?  I find the Rook to be a very interesting and fun little ship - but if it spawns too high, it can&#39;t get into visual range of grounded targets to bomb effectively before getting absolutely creamed by any 130 proxy shells that happen to be there.  When the Rook spawns low, it&#39;s not as big of a deal since with enough horizontal speed it seems like you can often &#39;outrun&#39; the proxy shells and only take moderate damage instead of being instantly turned into a puff of black smoke and twisted superstructure.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(388)">View full post</button><div id="388" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Five tips I learned that increased my enjoyment of the game the most are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep your radar off on the flagship (usually), but using radar on fast moving small Squadrons is fine and can even be used to lure SGs off. </li>
<li>Forget Piotr&#39;s advice to focus on the &quot;red&quot; ships - you <em>need</em> some tankers to get your own ships anywhere. The Skylark tanker comes with ELINT too and with two ELINT units you can triangulate incoming SGs. </li>
<li>Intel regenerates over time. Having a small long ranged ship that&#39;s able to linger in the backfield and scoop up extra intel gives you a huge advantage. </li>
<li>Carriers win wars. Know carriers. Love carriers. </li>
<li>Whenever possible focus on refueling at fuel cities. Plan movement so you can refuel there. Your pocketbook will thank you.</li>

<button onclick="toggles(392)">View full post</button><div id="392" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>For the sake of hearing about said failures in detail, I have a vested interest in not giving you too much advice, so here&#39;s some that will still let you learn by failing miserably a few times, but will maybe keep you alive a <em>little</em> longer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep 50k ish in the bank at the start of the campaign. Fuel is expensive.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t keep your jammer on (if you have one)—only jam when you&#39;re 100% a strike group is on your ass. It lights you up like a Christmas tree on every radar within 3000 or so klicks. If you don&#39;t know what the funny red button next to the ECM does, don&#39;t click it. I learned this one like 30 hours in... whoops.</li>
<li>Strike at night, out of sight. Out of sight, out of mind. Out of mind, no alert. No alert, no SG/TG (Strike Group/Tactical Group) breathing down your neck. Only do this if you have time to spare so you can wait for nighttime.</li>
<li>Listen to the general. Send a fast group of craft ahead to take a city. If you are fast enough (~400 kph in the day, a little slower at night), you can catch them unawares, and they won&#39;t have time to raise the alarm.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t bother with cipher keys. You can decrypt messages pretty easily if you remember the RECEIVER = MESSAGE = SENDER format. Just remember the senders, and you can figure it out. Alternatively, use unusually short words or words that come up a lot, like KG, KM, SPEED, NORTH, EAST, etc.</li>
<li>When you intercept a message from a convoy, remember that they tell you their path in the message, along with some things like eta, speed, etc. Very useful.</li>
<li>Use the funny little drawing tools and a calculator. Find routes. Plot waypoints. Keep things straight. It&#39;ll help a ton.</li>
<li>TURN OFF YOUR RADAR UNLESS YOU NEED IT. SGs notice it. So do their antirad missiles. (You could also use sector search if you know a convoy is in a particular direction.)</li>
<li>Hidden cities exist. They don&#39;t show up on the map, you can stay there forever, and they have a shipyard and supplies. They&#39;re always at least 600 klicks from cities/map edges, so you can use the compass tool to get an idea of where they might be. Alternatively, follow roads out of cities that appear to lead nowhere (just zoom in a bunch).</li>
<li>Convoys don&#39;t follow the lines between cities. Instead, they fly along it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helped. But not too much. I hope to hear about your inevitable misadventures.</p>

<h2>I've got most of the basics down, struggling to "git gud"</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(397)">View full post</button><div id="397" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><ol>
<li>Best: T7&#39;s with A2AMs | Good: Single fast ship sent out to intercept with Proxy 100+mm, 6+ 57mm, or R9 Sprints | Better than nothing: R9 Sprints on your main fleet, fire 2 at a time</li>
<li>Generally I&#39;d send T-7s against ships in wings of 2, La-29s in wings of 3 - they stand the best chance of dealing significant focused damage without overkilling. T7s alone with A2Ams to intercept missiles, and half the enemy number of T7s with A2Ams to intercept airstrikes</li>
<li>Best value - 100mm, with the caveat that its inaccuracy makes it best up close where it&#39;s risky to be. 57mm can be good in large (4+) numbers, and 130mm are best with good aim but significantly more expensive.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t bother with jamming, I haven&#39;t and really haven&#39;t missed it after completing 2 hard runs.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that search radar is a scam and the best radar solution is a few large FCR ships spread wherever you have splinter fleets, turning each one off if ELINT gets too spicy until all clear.</li>
<li>Sarmat has terrible DPS for its ammo cost. Squalls have terrible weight for their damage output. Mass 130mm will outperform both. Squalls can still be fun for big dakka but maybe after you&#39;ve won a run.</li>
<li>Not by default.</li>
<li>Keep in mind your shots inherit your OWN velocity as well as needing to lead the enemy. It&#39;s easiest to shoot when stationary or drifting slowly.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve grown out of Zeniths. The one ship class they&#39;re arguably decent on is supersonic interceptors due to the limited mass required for a significant alpha damage burst, and not being used in most garrison combats.</li>
</ol>

<p>Designing good small ships is a bit tricky, I&#39;d start with a 3 or 4 AK100 base, make sure to add lots of gimballed thrusters to allow quick dodges in any direction, and coat the outside of your ship in an empty 1x1 layer of hull designed entirely to be blown off often and repaired cheaply instead of expensive internals or heavy armor.</p>

<li>Everyone is saying the Sevastopol is ass and needs to just sit in the desert. Should I scrape off and sell all the redundant electronics and armor and turn it into a missile platform? Also, will keeping it in the desert drain fuel even when it&#39;s stationary?</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been advised to get 2 lightnings and 2 skylarks as starting ships. When attacking a transport/garrison, what do I do with the skylark? Should I have it hang around away from the fighting and rejoin with the lightnings afterwards?</li>
<li>The shipbuilder controls are extremely clunky to me. I read the manual but it doesn&#39;t go into detail about any keybinds, just left and right click. Is there any way past this or do I just have to deal with it?</li>
<li>What electronics should each ship have? Should I put the bigass sensors on my combat ships or leave them on the skylarks?</li>
<li>Am I actually supposed to win this game, or just do a little bit better each time? The endgame seems nearly impossible from what I&#39;ve seen.</li>

<h2>Highfleet Unofficial Ship Expansion Pack 3.0 'Iron Resurgence' Release</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/BooperSnootz </span><span class = "numcomments">5 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Highfleet/comments/xzfjqg/highfleet_unofficial_ship_expansion_pack_30_iron/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(414)">View full post</button><div id="414" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to present my 3.0 update of my Highfleet Unofficial Ship Expansion Pack 3.0 &#39;Iron Resurgence&#39; Release.</p>

<p>This update brings many overhauls and balances to the current ships in the Ship Pack to bring them in line to Highfleet 1.151. Also brings some new ships to the Ship pack bringing the total to 20 additional ships to Highfleet!</p>

<p>For those who are just hearing about this Ship pack here&#39;s a description about this Ship pack, please scroll down to find update notes.</p>

<p>Description: These are ships I created to expand the roster of current ships in Highfleet, you can download each ship individually or the entire pack. This ship pack contains 20 ships that is great for anyone who enjoys using vanilla ships in their campaign but just wish there were more ships to choose from.</p>

<p>Objective: The goal was to create ships that fit in with Vanilla ship&#39;s aesthetics while filling in niche roles that I felt were missing in game or just needed more variety. Room has been left to allow players to customize/optimize these ships in the campaign shipworks. I really tried to make sure these ships didn&#39;t overstep their roles to make any vanilla ships irrelevant but rather simply adds to one&#39;s tactical options during ship selection. These ships were all made from scratch and took alot of time to work on so please be respectful. Note* These ships are NOT created to be the most optimized ships but rather made to be balanced closely with Vanilla ships while still having unique roles.</p>

<p>Lore: The Romani Empire posses a vast variety of ships, indeed, many ships have been created by both the Dynasty as well as individual houses. They range from combat vessels to common civilian vessels but all were made for a purpose. Ships created in the Romani Empire rarely travel anywhere outside of the empire or atleast rarely seen roaming around Gerat and tend to operate only within the Empire&#39;s borders. These are dark times however and the Romani fleet will use anything at their disposal to fight upcoming threats such as &#39;The Gathering&#39;, whatever their plans may be.</p>

<p>Editing/modifying permission: Once you download your free to do whatever you like with the ships but if you are planning to download, modify and re-upload my ships please give credit. These ships took along time to build and test so it would be unfortunate if someone re-uploaded and tried to take credit for my hard work. Thank you</p>

<p>Download link is in this Steam Discussion -&gt; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1434950/discussions/0/3032599335604527036/?tscn=1631305131">https://steamcommunity.com/app/1434950/discussions/0/3032599335604527036/?tscn=1631305131</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Update Notes: There&#39;s actually alot of updates so I recommend checking out the link above to read through the extensive update notes. </p>

<p>Hope you all enjoy these changes/overhauls &amp; new ships and please feel free to make any suggestions or ask any questions.</p>

<p>Note* I am currently updating the ships yet again for the next 1.16 version that may be coming out soon so not to worry some ships will be receiving another update to become balanced with the changes coming soon!</p>

<p>Enjoy and fly safe!</p>

<button onclick="toggles(458)">View full post</button><div id="458" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hello, i got this game recently and am finding it very enjoyable, but i can&#39;t really seem to make any progress. i always end up dying before even making it a third of the way to the final objective.</p>

<p>the combat i&#39;m alright with, it&#39;s the strike and tactical fleets that make me want to commit war crimes. strike fleets just show up out of nowhere and send so many planes and missiles that my fleet just gets blown up without even doing anything. the tactical fleets are the same issue but not as bad since they don&#39;t move and just stay in a city.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure how i&#39;m supposed to deal with either of them, i can never seem to sneak around, they always track me down,  whenever i run i just get half my ships blown up anyways by planes and missiles, and fighting them is impossible without the flagship. do you all have any advice, on how to deal with them or at least make it so whenever i run into one i don&#39;t just lose all my ships and fuel and hopes and dreams. </p>

<p>thx in advance🖤</p>

<button onclick="toggles(523)">View full post</button><div id="523" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Here’s a list of things that were hard to find answers for and took a lot of googling, some of these may have a question mark ? and hopefully the community can provide answers. Add on some more tips if I miss anything.</strong></p>

<p>As customary:</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;If you start hearing this music, you&#39;re already dead.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>General:</strong></p>

<p>-move your mouse to the right of the screen at the fuel fill-up shop to see ammunitions and ordinance, every city has some.</p>

<p>-special ammunition and missiles are expensive, replacing destroyed ship parts is expensiver.</p>

<p>-special ammo is shared through your whole fleet inventory, regardless of which craft or group buys it.  Salvaged or bought ship parts/missiles are not (?), and detachments must link up with the flagship or other groups to share parts.</p>

<p>-you can choose a (slightly) longer aiming line in the options.</p>

<p>-when the dialogue says north, it&#39;s not a bearing, just a general direction. If its says <em>far</em> north, it could be up to 4000km away, or around 4 city jumps. If it doesn&#39;t say <em>far</em>, it should usually be within 2000km.</p>

<p>-text that has two pairs of numbers separated by degree signs are coordinates, which change based on mouse location and can be found in the bottom right of the screen</p>

<p>-Write notes on your map in the free or unused space you have, it may clutter your screen but the game has a bad habit of not recording some info, or making it a runaround to find.</p>

<p>-tracking down a radio signal will unpause the game.</p>

<p>-Losing a campaign will contribute starting money to your next campaign based on how many kills and cities you get. Doing worse on the next campaign <del>will reduce that(?)</del></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/sk_2013">u/sk_2013</a> - Doing worse does not appear to reduce it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Cipher keys change every time you go north to a new chunk of cities.</p>

<p>-Low morale &lt;5/6 will cause your crew to ask themselves: <em>&quot;Are we the baddies?&quot;</em>  which can subsequently lead to having to execute that ship the next time you fight.</p>

<p>-read the manual</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Cities/Shops/Repairyards:</strong></p>

<p>-Intel cities regenerate intel over time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Intel regenerates one point per 24 hours </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Docking at a city for longer than 12ish hours will turn it dangerous. 24 and it turns hostile. these values never revert. (Is it cumulative among different ships?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Yes, danger levels persist between different ship groups and a city will get ticked off if any of the imperials are in the city for too long </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-If an alarm goes off and your clock turns red, that means EVERY (?) strike group on the map is coming to check it out, and every city will instantly know when you enter their red radar ring. Wait the clock out to do silent strikes again, but beware, those SG’s are still coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/clee-saan">u/clee-saan</a> - There are two kinds of alarms. One lasts for six hours, the other lasts for twelve hours. The twelve hour alarm is triggered by a ship being seen, and behaves as described above. The six hour alarm is triggered by a jet or missile attack (seeing the jet does not trigger the alarm, only the jet going into combat). This alarm does not call Strike Groups, it just makes it impossible to get sudden strike. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-ship parts cost their value to attach to a ship, you pay double if you buy that part for your inventory then attach it, instead sell the part then attach it directly from the shop. Salvaged weapons and parts still cost their value to be attached.</p>

<p>-cant land a ship because its legs got blown off? Repair them in the air first by right clicking the missing parts or using the repair slider, auto repairs usually prioritize legs first</p>

<p>-landing a leg on two different repair percentages adds that together for a higher value.</p>

<p>-When you zoom out, cities with bigger circles will have stronger garrisons. This trend increases as you  get closer to Khiva.</p>

<p>-hidden cities are generally no further than 600km from a marked one, its good to use the compass tool to see the range that hidden cities may spawn when searching the large shape spaces.</p>

<p>-Your personal ship designs <del>may possibly (???)</del> show up at mercenary towns for sale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/sk_2013">u/sk_2013</a> - They can. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Unused fuel at cities or salvage spots will remain and can be used by other ships that stop there</p>

<p>-taking off before fully refueling the amount you paid for will not refund your purchase (?), but your fuel will remain to come back to.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Ordinance/Planes</strong></p>

<p>-T7’s fly at 1250kmh, LA-29’s at 800. Both take 10 hours max to refuel(?).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Cristobalxds">u/Cristobalxds</a> - T7&#39;s are faster than missiles and they can attack them multiple times even if they fail to destroy them in the first try. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-You can stagger aircraft bombings by sending one plane with ordinance at a time. They will not merge together on the map, but you will be unable to tell who is carrying what ordinance.</p>

<p>This is great if you have a silent strike interceptor enroute and you want to soften up a garrison instead of completely destroying it without a chance to salvage. Jets can be redirected at the last second if you think the next ordinance drop will ruin your salvage. This also saves the planes from AA fire as sending more than three planes in one strike usually leads to the second wave getting the full brunt of AA fire. The garrison should still be grounded when each plane comes by and when your interceptor intercepts it (?).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/sk_2013">u/sk_2013</a> - I would argue sets of 3 are more useful than sets of 1 aircraft- 3 planes is still below the &quot;saturation point&quot; where they come in multiple waves, but you get more planes per volley, better target organization, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Launched missiles can only be restocked by repairing your ship at a city. keep a stockpile in your fleet.</p>

<p>-missiles turn on their tracking at the end of their targeting arrow, this is handy for pre-emptive strikes ahead of your strikes.</p>

<p>MISSILES CAN TARGET YOUR OWN SHIPS</p>

<p>-Use the KH15 missiles for garrisons or convoys (if they warrant it). Save the anti radiations (p) for strike/tactical groups that use or emit radar, they can turn on a dime if you’re slightly off when targeting traveling SG&#39;s. Anti radiation missiles also WILL NOT TARGET anything not using a radar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - You can use supersonic planes to guide strategic missiles into your target </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-A-100 Missiles travel 4320 kmh but only have a range of 400km. They are faster in combat scenes and harder to shoot down. They utilize proximity fuzes with minor AP and are great for short range attacks on soft targets or intercepting other missiles/planes, but are expensive.</p>

<p>-R3 missiles take a suborbital route at travel at 8000 kmh with a range of 2000 km, but have no strategic guidance and should only be aimed at static targets.</p>

<p>-Missiles launched at you can be both normal or P, with no way of knowing which. If its not a KH15, you&#39;re probably already trying to shoot it down with your flagship&#39;s point defense or it just detonated in midair and you get to roleplay that scene from Terminator 2 where Sarah Connor gets turned into a spooki skeleton.</p>

<p>-Nukes are great at wiping out garrisons, cities, Strike groups and eventually, yourself off the map. Keep the genie in the bottle and sell them for good money to remove the temptation of fulfilling the wish of bringing a nuclear winter to the Mojave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Honkmainster">u/Honkmainster</a> - bonus: if you nuke a city you really “nuke” a city so no shop no yard no mercenaries to buy, can’t land or refuel, etc…  </p>

<p>also if you get hit with a nuke a few time in a row it can knock out your comms and ability to control the squad for a while bcs EMP pulse…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Combat and Planning</strong></p>

<p>-Alarmless Silent Strikes depend mostly on speed, anything faster than 350kmh shouldn’t have an issue, unfortunately this bars the Gladiator.</p>

<p>-The silent strike tool in the bottom right of your strategic screen shows your strike group&#39;s chances of detection for what the enemy may be using to detect you (radar/elint). Larger ships, or ships with upgraded with layers of reinforced hull have a higher chance of radio detection. Smaller ships with less engines have lower chance of being spotted with IFR.</p>

<p>-Enemy SG&#39;s and Convoys have reduced radar and detection range when landed. Visual is reduced from 100 to 75 km at night.</p>

<p>-Morale is important, and hard to regain if too much is lost. 12 hours in town will replenish 1 morale, the percentage progress remains if another is lost through combat/events or gained and can be continued at other towns. Try to give your strike groups enough time to rest after fighting so that you can keep morale around 7-10. Also sitting in the desert does not count towards resting.</p>

<p>-ship on fire and you&#39;re out of fire extinguishers? Retreating will instantly put it out at the cost of being a wuss and failing your silent strike if you only brought 1 ship.</p>

<p>-flare launchers are great. sometimes you have to launch more than one to knock off tracking, but they reload for free after combat.</p>

<p>-Ships with green circles/ semi circles have the APS Palash systems installed. expend these with large caliber shells before shooting missile or expensive ammo. AP ammo will not trigger it.</p>

<p>-APS Palash systems <del>must also be replaced when used up, unfortunately they do not restock like flares.</del></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Luchiannno">u/Luchiannno</a> - palash isn&#39;t one time use module, it&#39;s just like flare launcher. And since it&#39;s expensive module, try to protect it well. Don&#39;t just stick it to sides where it&#39;s vulnerable.  </p>

<p>Palash also recharges during the battle, but recharge is quite slow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-You can only select 1 special ammo per weapon type on your craft before going into battle, but can switch between them and the free HE ammo during combat at the cost of reload time.</p>

<p>-Armor piecing ammo travels a lot faster than regular HE rounds, but has a signficantly reduced range. this makes aim leading easier, but you gotta get a lot closer.</p>

<p>-proximity fuse ammo is overpowered at the start for wiping garrisons but falls off quickly against armor, strip armor with regular HE before using proximity shells. Also they have a tendency to detonate when shooting near falling destroyed ships, or <em>escape pods</em>.</p>

<p>-Incendiary ammo is also highly effective, but you often don&#39;t have enough flight time to wait for it to burn out ships. Relighting is also necessary until your enemies run out of extinguishers.</p>

<p>-Enemies will use special ammo against you, the best way to counter this is by being far away from those rounds, or intercepting them with R9/37mm/prox ammo.</p>

<p>-enemy ships in combat with missiles fire every 20 seconds, and do<del>nt</del> run out(?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Hostile ships do run out of anti ship tactical missiles </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Combatting larger enemy ships, like most inner-city gang fights, you either aim for the head, or shoot them in the ass.</p>

<p>-constantly going into black screen in combat while dodging will not affect your crew or morale, but watching enemy engine directions is important for tracking their movement and leading your shots. Also lots of maneuvers and burning with shift will kill your fuel and fight timer</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>The Enemy/Convoys</strong></p>

<p>-Strike Groups(?) and Tactical Groups don&#39;t respawn, theres about 6-12(?) SG&#39;s on normal. They always spawn at the start of the game from a Fleet HQ (Save icon City).</p>

<p>-Strike groups field the largest and strongest ships you will see in the campaign, they pale in comparison to what you can make viable (But not fuel efficient) in the ship builder.</p>

<p>-Convoys <del>do respawn(? Just not from liberated cities?)</del></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Convoys don’t respawn </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Trade convoys don&#39;t use radar, but may have ELINT or IFR. Rely on camping trade routes/cities with IFR to figure out when they&#39;ve landed or where they&#39;re going.</p>

<p>-Trade convoys in the air will almost always send out an alarm on visual contact, attack them on the ground, or attack with something that can fly around 700kph. launched missiles and planes generally aim for the prize ship, so you&#39;ll have to rely on strikegroups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Morthra">u/Morthra</a> -Lategame trade convoys will have Negevs, which have radar. None of the vanilla ships are fast enough to silent strike locations that have radar. Strike groups larger than a single lightning (basically) will always get spotted by infrared, which trade convoys have, so silent striking one is nearly impossible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-To reduce the blank words in your radio interceptions, take the time to make sure the receiver direction pin is as far right as possible, how long it takes you doesn&#39;t seem to matter(?).</p>

<p>-SG&#39;s and Convoys spend time in city stops to refuel, or repair if they&#39;ve fire missiles at you or lost airplanes. Usual refueling time is unknown (?Comments?).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Tarkhans</strong></p>

<p>-Tarkhans have some traits that are consistent, usually being elaim or romani. Most of everything else is randomized each campaign, a tarkhan guide online can show you what worldview each speech card influences as well as gifts.</p>

<p>-gifts are attributed to a worldview, use the wrong one and it&#39;ll take away points, the right one will give. Regardless, a gift will extend your conversation.</p>

<p>-failing to recruit a tarkhan is not the end, they may show up again in another city and will have the same worldviews.</p>

<p>-Press the ask for help button in the top right of the strategic screen to see your tarkhans and what favours they offer. Using one costs a star, but those can be regained in city events depending on your choices. Try to retain the amount of stars you have with each Tarkhan because that can help you in the endgame(?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Morthra">u/Morthra</a> - When you get to Khiva <span class="md-spoiler-text">you get one free ship for every tarkhan star you have. </span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Shipbuilding</strong></p>

<p>-If you&#39;re trying to build a new flagship (with the star) in the shipbuilder, load the sevastapol and remove everything but the bridge (Pull the bridge out, drag left click across the rest of the ship and hit delete key). then save your new ship under a different name.</p>

<p>-If you have an already built ship and want to turn it into the flashship, you&#39;ll have to look up (Maybe someone can comment it) how to edit the ships Seria file in your game directory to insert the line of code needed to ID it as a flagship.</p>

<p>-Beware if you use older ship designs from this subreddit, they are usually pretty awesome, but created before weight and value changes that may make them no longer viable in the new update (1.14)</p>

<p><del>-the only way to delete a ship is through accessing the ship files in the game directory, pretty easy to access through steam</del></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - You can delete ships from the campaign start screen while selecting your fleet, right click deletes them after a confirmation window. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Spacing your armor with reinforced hull away from the main hull is a great way to avoid splash damage to your inner components. unfortunately it makes you a huge radar blip.</p>

<p>-Building a giant 180mm spewing 3 armor plated 2000 tons of fuel per 1000km death brick is cool, but what about <strong><em>Aesthetics?</em></strong></p>

<p>-Jammers are so cool they don&#39;t even have a description in the ship builder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Morthra">u/Morthra</a> -Some missiles are radar guided - A-100s and Kh-15s. If you turn on jamming, the radar cone of these missiles will be reduced (though A-100s travel much faster than Kh-15s, so they may hit you anyway), possibly causing them to miss. However, Kh-15P missiles - which are anti-radiation - will miss under normal circumstances and lock on to you if you turn on jamming.   </p>

<p>Jamming can be picked up by strike groups which have double range ELINT from anywhere on the map, however, as it has a radar footprint of 4km (double range ELINT can detect it from 8km).   </p>

<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Jammers are useful in a few ways. They’re most valuable when you’re already in the air, although they can be useful if you have several groups parked close to one another, and one group throws on the hammer and runs into Allah’s open arms to save the other group. Otherwise, a small fast ship with a radar jammer can detach from the main fleet and draw off a radar homing missile. Alternately, jamming ships can kite out strike groups, and jammers can also be used to get pretty close to missile carriers without your main attacking force taking too much fire on the way in. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Having insufficient power reduces the maneuverability of your lateral thrusters and turret rotation speeds</p>

<p>-Having insufficient ammo will knock out use of one of your weapons, usually the last one you added or the farthest away.</p>

<p>-Having insufficient humans doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue(??????)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Crew currently don’t do anything </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Valiant_Storm-">u/Valiant_Storm-</a> APS Palash and Flares can be mounted under armor and can shoot straight through if perpendicular to armor facing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong></p>

<p>-Try not to get into the habit of holding your shift key for everything, sometimes its good to go slow and analyze or have some time to react if something unexpected shows up.</p>

<p>-By now you should realize that you&#39;ll want to keep your more auxiliary Flagship parked in the desert, far out of the radar range or flightpath of SG&#39;s and convoys. your own strike groups should be running around and doing the heavy lifting at the start, and keeping your Flagship&#39;s location away from prying eyes.</p>

<p>-fighting a fat boy? Pick a side and pound it. look at their ship layouts before battle to figure out what angle will drill to ammunition or the bridge the fastest</p>

<p>-If you&#39;re confident that you can keep your auxiliary ships and carriers out of combat, stripping them of armor and heavy pieces lightens the load on your fuel costs.</p>

<p>-fiddle with the display options if you dont like the CRT screen effect.</p>

<p>-prioritize salvaging when safe, Weapons and hull parts are important for upgrades or mainly <strong>money</strong>, survivors will negate morale loss and fuel can be economic and useful in the long run. Captain and crew quarters have benefit if you have poor access to intel or need gifts for tarkhans, while radio is only useful when you need new ciphers, which having one or two is usually good enough.</p>

<p>The fuel priority helps keep your strikegroups independent from needing to refill at the carrier or buying fuel, while also preventing you from losing other options, or those crew while you are salvaging the other options. Survivors are important if you&#39;re on the line for morale.</p>

<p>-having a bug or two is great, bug as in a small, unarmed, long range and sensor packed ship that you can park between cities to scan for SG’s with ELINT or convoys with IFR. Secondary uses include jumping between captured intel cities, or buzzing alert garrisons far away from your fleet and operations to throw off both missiles, planes, and strike groups. They also make great couriers if you need special ammo and it&#39;s in a different city.</p>

<p>-Honestly having that one little ship spamming intel cities will keep you ahead of SG&#39;s and tactical groups, especially after someone raises an alarm you can find out about how long you have before a SG reaches you, or if you&#39;re within range of a MC or AC.</p>

<p>-have a calculator on hand, it helps with calculating convoy/SG speeds from radio transmissions or intel.  mark them on the map and direction, each map mark will show how old it is.</p>

<p>-The Sevastopol is not great, you&#39;re meant to upgrade it throughout a campaign towards what you need it to do, or after a few runs you&#39;ll know exactly what you need from your Flagship and can build one that suits your strategy in the shipbuilder.</p>

<p>-Watch some Phrosphor videos, he pretty much walks you through how to beat a campaign and what makes for good ship design.</p>

<p>-There will inevitably be a point when garrisons become too difficult for your lightnings and interceptors to reliably destroy with a silent strike, either start utilizing aircraft or ballistic missiles to soften them up ahead of the strike</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>-Choose a deity to pray to, stockpile AA missiles, proximity ammo, r9 sprints and T7&#39;s, then start sending out the big boys to fight. You will lose the element of surprise, and will attract the attention of every SG, missile carrier and aircraft on the map, salvaging will be nearly impossible, and repairs will be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>

<p><strong>You will either tear a hole straight to Khiva or</strong> <strong><em>die trying.</em></strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Advice from people</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CloakAndDaggr">u/CloakAndDaggr</a> - Some of the Strike Group ships only have 2 heavy thrusters so, there are some very effective tactics involving AP ammo and knocking one of them out, causing the victim to lose control. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/CommunistKebab">u/CommunistKebab</a> - Missiles aren&#39;t <em>that</em> fancy, never forget that a-100s have 400km range, so don&#39;t go and waste them. The real kicker is aircraft. 122mm aircraft rockets are expensive, 100kg bombs are underwhelming. Stock up on 250kg bombs and send all you have to the enemy strike groups in a group of 2-3. send jets one by one, maybe two but no more than that, they are valuable. Always send a single regular plane to scout first and locate the enemy, use the enemy ship&#39;s ELINT to get a rough estimate. if you can catch strike groups inside a city that&#39;s much better. You can launch your entire fleet once, or maybe 1.5-twice to wear down the enemy, and then send the pride of the romani fleet, the sexiest ship in vanilla, the all mighty Sevastopol to just steamroll over the half-dead fleet. Basically send everything you have on top of the enemy and it will work, foolproof 10/10 tactic. You can easily take out a strike group, but taking two back to back is hard, taking three is impossible. I&#39;m 40% in my run and have demolished all 5 strike groups. My suggestion is to remove the missiles and rockets from the sevastopol and add reinforced hull to the gaps. clean and simple transition. </p>

<h2>Tips for beginners</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(524)">View full post</button><div id="524" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted this as a reply to another thread, but figured it would be good to make as a new post in case some miss it. I currently have about 22 hours in game.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Play the game like a strategy game. Keep your flag ship parked out in the desert and hidden while you have 2 or 3 small strike groups conquer territory. Only move the flagship (Tanker) into captured areas. I like to only move it into fuel depots so I can top off for cheap. I suggest beginners make 2 SGs, each with a Skylark, Navarin, and a Lightning.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off your radar as soon as the game starts. This might not be obvious, but 5 years of experience as a Navy Officer helped me here. Turn it off! You are outnumbered and anyone can see radar twice as far away as it can see anything else. 
If you do Turn it on, sector it and only turn it on if you are in a bad spot and desperately need some situational awareness, or if you want to draw enemy attention away from your vital ships and resources. (Slap a radar on a Rook and screw with the enemy SGs head).</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to buy bombs, missiles, and fire suppression tanks whenever you can, they aren&#39;t always available. </p></li>
<li><p>Ramming maneuvers are effective in a pinch, but can negatively affect morale.</p></li>
<li><p>If your run is clearly doomed and you are about to get pinched, remember to use your nukes. It exponentially makes the game harder, but it might help you live a few days longer and roll over a larger bonus score for your follow up run.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your pencil, ruler, and compass. Most enemy fleets only travel around 96 Km/h. If you find a fleet, mark it with and X and title it, then use the compass to draw a circle at 960 kilometers. You now now the furtherst that strikegroup can go in 10 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>This is guerrilla Warfare. Don&#39;t be afraid to sacrifice a ship or two to slow down an enemy strike group. If you damage them enough, they will land for repairs and potentially save your other ships.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on and on, but this game just has so much depth. Don&#39;t be afraid to think outside the box. This game is the closest thing to a modern naval warfare simulator I&#39;ve ever played. 
Try to remember that whatever would slow you down or confuse you will also confuse or hinder the AI.</p>
