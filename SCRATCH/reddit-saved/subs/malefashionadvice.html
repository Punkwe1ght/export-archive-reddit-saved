<hr/>

<p>This guide has been written under the assumption that you already have an adequate understanding of fit, color, and composition. If you don’t, I recommend that you read the sidebar until you have a firm grasp on these concepts. I’m still going to cover them, but it will be easier to understand with prior knowledge. </p>

<p>This is the first of nine sections, all of which will cover different topics. Here is the order in which I plan on releasing them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Main Guide</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Sleeve Shirts</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Sleeve Shirts</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shorts</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pants</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shoes</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sweaters</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jackets</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessories</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This section of the guide will cover a variety of topics, namely: transitioning from F/W into S/S, exploring color, learning about patterns, materials, and fabrics / weaves, examining popular trends, and building a wardrobe. I will also include a section containing further reading in addition to an inspiration dump. </p>

<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy it! :)</p>

<h2>How I found jeans that fit my weird body properly</h2>

<div id="3ewe3h" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For a while, it&#39;s been hard for me find jeans that fit my body. Most of my friends can pick up 511&#39;s or 513&#39;s and be good to go, but not me. I have a weird body, where my calves are really big, almost as big as my thighs. So It&#39;s hard to find jeans that sit well in the thigh, but also taper once it gets past my calves. The issue is, straight leg pants look like boot cut. Because, they fit the seat nicely, but once they hit the calves, they stick like skinny jeans. And once the jeans get past the calf, they give the visual of flaring out, since they went from skinny to straight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Height: 6&#39;3</p>

<p>Weight: 195 lb/88 kg</p>

<p>Size: 32x36</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/TPxbz">Here (potentionally NSFW)</a> is an album of my lower body, just to show you how it&#39;s shaped. See how the calves are very present, most people have a very naturally tapered leg, with way smaller calves. Also, I have a big butt for a male. I do squat, but I mean, look at me, I&#39;m not very big or advanced as you can tell, so I never considered that a factor.</p>

<p>First up,</p>

<p><strong>Levi 514:</strong> The Levi 514&#39;s catchphrase is &quot;straight fit&quot; so obviously the pants don&#39;t taper. I tried these on, and they felt great in the seat and thigh, but they felt and looked way too loose from the knee down, you can&#39;t cuff or pinroll these pants without it looking funky, so I knew there had to be a more tapered, but comfortable fit.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://imgur.com/a/udM78">LEVI 514 ALBUM HERE</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Levi 513:</strong> The Levi 513 is the &quot;Slim-Straight&quot; fit. I&#39;ve read many things about the 513&#39;s saying, if you have bigger legs and calves, get the 513&#39;s, they are bigger than the 511&#39;s, and trust me, I can NOT wear 511&#39;s. The 511&#39;s are truly painted on skinny jeans for me. What&#39;s interesting about the 513&#39;s is, the fit SO uncomfortably, but after hours of wear, they fit pretty well, I think. But, after several washes and weight gain, I think they don&#39;t at all anymore. I have included 2 fits in this album that showcase me in my 513&#39;s at ~185lb. One is Blue Stone, and the other is Bastion.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/20YA0"><strong>LEVI 513 ALBUM HERE</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>LEVI 541:</strong> The Levi 541 is Levi&#39;s &quot;Athletic Fit&quot;. Generally, this is the jean everyone talks about when people ask &quot;plz help me find jeans for my monster thighs, i lift weights and play football etc&quot;. I didn&#39;t think these would do it, but maybe I should have. The atheletic fit fits the thighs beautifully, and it tapers down perfectly over the calf, while not hugging it at all, and makes a small 15.25 inch/ 40cm opening. These jeans are COMFORTABLE. I took a chance on them on Amazon, and I am so happy. They have a very slim fit for me, and they do not hug the leg a single bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Hk8vK"><strong>LEVI 541 ALBUM HERE</strong></a></p>

<p>Final words, I wanted this post to help anyone in my current position out. But I also want to know what you guys think of on the fit of these jeans. I am still unsure as to what fit is best for me, and while I think it is the 541, I could be wrong. I tried the 505&#39;s on at the store, and it would have been perfect, but it wasn&#39;t man butt friendly. I think if you have larger thighs, or calves, regardless of genetic or fitness factors, you should definitely check out the 541&#39;s.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m looking for....</p>

<ol>
<li>Quality. I want a thick flannel shirt, but not a shirt jacket. I want it to last a long time. </li>
<li>Slim(ish) fit. I&#39;m 6&#39; 1&quot; and 155. Most &quot;regular&quot; sized shirts look too large on me. A slim cut or a slim fit is necessary. </li>
<li>Made in the USA. (Or at least made in a developed country.) I prefer to spend my money on crafted products versus manufactured products. </li>
<li>HOWEVER, I&#39;m also hoping to spend &lt;$100 per shirt (perhaps thanks to sale event). If your favorite flannel costs more, I&#39;d still love to hear it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, this is a tall order. Thank you all for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the help! Sorting through responses now. May we all fulfill our flannel needs this holiday season. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Hold on to your hats folks - I&#39;ve got some info that&#39;ll blow your mind.</p>

<p>Over the last 25 years, consumer package goods manufacturers have been battling hard to earn their customers&#39; dollars over their respective competitors.  If you think you can&#39;t get ink out of clothes, you&#39;re living in the past.</p>

<p>First - go to your local grocery store/convenience store - buy a &#39;big brand&#39; detergent bottle (think Tide or similar), a bottle of rubbing alcohol, a bottle of SHOUT, a big box of Gauze (or a HUGE bag of cotton balls), and some rubber gloves.  </p>

<p>Once at home, grab all the shirts that don&#39;t have ink stains larger than a pea, dab a small amount of detergent on each of the stains, throw in washing machine and wash how you normally do (add usual amount of detergent, use the same wash/spin cycle).  It may take 2 washes, but this knocks out small ink stains - all the major brands conquered small ink stains around 2007-2008.</p>

<p>For ink stains larger than a pea (and this is only because you don&#39;t want to wash the ink out of your shirt only to have it washed in elsewhere) - turn the shirt inside out, adorn rubber gloves, take a dry gauze/cottonball and place on the exterior face of the stain (that means dry material on the inside of your inside-out shirt).  Wet a gauze/cottonball with rubbing alcohol, and get ready to be a little bored, I do this while watching TV if I have to.  Gently rub in all directions (circles both ways, up/down, side to side, diagonals, etc.).  You will see ink starting to absorb on the dry side gauze as well as some rubbing off onto the alcohol-wet gauze.  Swap out both of the gauze a couple times until the stain looks faded.  That means you&#39;ve removed the free floating ink from the stain - now just apply some SHOUT, wash as normal, and expect to repeat 1-2 more times</p>

<p>People on this sub will spend $150 on a nice shirt, and then let something like a little time, elbow grease, and ~$25 in supplies get in the way of salvaging a pricey garment</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks to <a href="/u/Seber">/u/Seber</a> for sharing a website that vastly surpasses my own knowledge - link to his comment (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/4xdcum/my_girlfriend_has_successfully_ruined_my_entire/d6esozb">https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/4xdcum/my_girlfriend_has_successfully_ruined_my_entire/d6esozb</a>)</p>

<h2>Beginner's Guide to Buying Expensive Clothes for Less</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>a very very special thanks to <a href="/u/setfiretoflames">/u/setfiretoflames</a> for his feedback and editing &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</em> </p>

<p>Did you just stumble upon MFA and find yourself appalled by the prices of some of the shit you saw in WAYWT? Are you looking to try some higher end clothing but put off by the prices? Did you fall in love with something in WAYWT and then find out it costs more than your rent? Then this guide is for you.</p>

<p>I want to explain how someone can afford to buy expensive clothes on a normal person’s salary and want to help you feel OK about spending ridiculous amounts of money on that one thing you can’t stop lusting after. </p>

<p>One thing I want to get out of the way right at the start: fashion is still an expensive hobby. For most people, you need to make it a financial priority to be able to buy cool, expensive shit. That can be through cutting back in other areas or only buying occasionally or whatever works for you, but the point is you might need to reexamine your idea of what a reasonable price for something is. </p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: This guide is very US-centric.</strong> Sorry. I live in the US and don’t know anything about shopping in other countries. This guide is also very basic. If these things seem obvious to you, it’s because you are not the target audience. </p>

<h1>Shopping Retail</h1>

<p><strong>Shopping Sales</strong> </p>

<p>The most expensive and easiest way to buy stuff is, of course, to buy it directly from a store. You should basically never pay full price for anything. There are two main types of sales: promo codes and individual item markdowns. Promo codes usually go out periodically throughout the year whereas item markdowns usually occur at the end of the season. </p>

<p><strong>The single best thing you can do to stay on top of sales is to sign up for every single store newsletter you can find.</strong> Use a Gmail account and these will all get filtered into your Promotions tab and won’t clutter your inbox, and you can just look at it every few days. There are also some “private sales” that are only available to email subscribers, so it’s doubly important for that reason. </p>

<p>Depending on the store, promo codes go out randomly and on holidays. These are generally something like “20% off the entire store”. Unlike at J. Crew or GAP, most high end retailers only send these codes out a few times a year. One of biggest holidays for promos is Black Friday. I’ll refer you to <a href="http://journal.styleforum.net/styleforum-black-friday-sale-list-2016/">Styleforum’s List of Black Friday Sales</a> as it’s a lot more comprehensive than anything I would ever write. Black Friday sales are good, but the best sales are actually still a month away. Other common promo days include Boxing Day, Christmas, and Memorial Day. </p>

<p>Waiting until the end of a season is almost always going to get you the best price. There is some risk involved in waiting, as you never know if something you like is going to sell out. If you’re trying to keep an eye on something, it’s a good idea to figure out how many they have left. A lot of stores have a warning like “Only one left!” in the size selection. If they don’t, try adding multiple to your cart to see how many they have left. Also think about how likely something is to sell out. Is it a hyped item? Is the price really good? Do you need a common size? </p>

<p>The first markdown still usually isn’t the best price. If you can wait, things will often get down to &gt;50% off. A lot of stores will start to run additional promo codes for the sale items, and you can start to get some really insane deals. </p>

<p>Americans can get some good deals right now by keeping currency in mind. The weak Canadian Dollar, subtraction of VAT, and Great British Pound can all lead to some really good deals. Great time to buy British shoes.  </p>

<p><strong>Store List</strong></p>

<p>Below are some brief notes on some of my favorite stores/stores with the best sales. These skew toward my taste, so anyone is welcome to add to them if they have stores I don’t shop at. </p>

<p><a href="http://nomanwalksalone.com">No Man Walks Alone</a> - 30ish% off for Black Friday. Keeps their markdowns up for a long time. Has a permanent discount code for StyleForum members. Takes preorders on StyleForum as well  with a 20% discount. </p>

<p><a href="http://ssense.com">Ssense</a> - Really shitty initial prices. Can have a lot of great deals when you get into deep sale. No promo codes. </p>

<p><a href="http://totokaelo.com">Totokaelo</a> - Really good end of season sales.  Runs a lot of “additional ____ off sale” codes. </p>

<p><a href="http://mrporter.com">Mr. Porter</a> - Terrible initial prices. Need to get into deep, deep sale in order for stuff to start being competitive. Runs $300 for $200 for AmEx members a few times a year.</p>

<p><a href="http://tres-bien.com">Tres-Bien</a> - Best prices around. Runs a ton of promo codes and has good markdowns. Permanent 20% off because of VAT for US customers. </p>

<p><a href="http://farfetch.com">Farfetch</a> - Good private sale. Prices fluctuate periodically throughout the year.</p>

<p><a href="http://dope-factory.com">Dope Factory</a> - No VAT. Good sales with promo codes. </p>

<p><a href="http://suspensionpoint.ca">Suspension Point</a> - Weak Canadian dollar. Keeps sale up forever. Good Boxing Day sale. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> - Weirdly enough Amazon occasionally has really great prices on some leftover designer stuff. You probably won&#39;t find good stuff on here, but it&#39;s worth looking. They also have good prices on some mid-tier brands like Chippewa, Naked and Famous, Red Wing, Wolverine, etc. </p>

<p><a href="http://eastdane.com">EastDane</a> - Usually does sale percentage based on how much you spend. Leaves clearance up for a long time and does a lot of promos on sale items. Free Prime shipping. </p>

<p><a href="https://18montrose.com/">18 Montrose</a> - Had a really great this sale year but has a terrible inventory management system and a lot of orders got cancelled. </p>

<p><strong>Yoox</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.yoox.com/">Yoox</a> is an interesting enough online store that I wanted to give it its own category. It’s essentially a designer outlet, with some capsule collections and Yoox only products too. While prices have gotten worse as of late, there are still some great deals to be had. To get them, though, you’ll need to slog through a clunky website and put up with terrible product photos. I find it a lot easier to look at specific brands I’m interested in, as there’s a ton of terrible stuff if you just sort by clothing type. Add something to your “Dream Box” and it should continue to drop quite a few times. Yoox will also email you and let you know when there is only one left.</p>

<p>Personally, I think Yoox is one of the best places to buy something a little “out there” if you’re trying to expand your style. There’s a ton of cheap stuff, and returns are super easy (although they will cost you like seven bucks). </p>

<p><strong>Sample Sales</strong></p>

<p>This only really applies if you’re living in a few select cities, but sample sales offer insanely cheap stuff if you’re in the right place at the right time. Google your city and “sample sales” to see if there are any coming up near you. If you live near NYC or LA, there are sales pretty much all the time. I use the <a href="https://www.chicmi.com/">calendars on ChicMi</a>. </p>

<h1>Shopping Secondhand</h1>

<p><strong>Grailed</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.grailed.com">Grailed</a> is pretty well known here, but I’m going to cover it very briefly anyway. It’s basically just a giant marketplace where people can post designer (or non-designer) clothes for other people to buy. The seller posts the item for whatever price and usually allows buyers to make an offer for less. Note when you are looking at prices that items are often priced higher than what the person is actually looking for. Don’t be afraid to make offers but don’t be a dick either. A “lowball” is a shitty offer close to the Grailed minimum offer of 60% of the asking price. Also remember that shipping is not included in the list price, but is included in your offer.</p>

<p><strong>Selling on Grailed</strong> </p>

<p>While this guide is focused primarily on buying, I want to cover selling on Grailed very quickly as it can be a great way to turn your old clothes into new ones. We could talk about Grailed “strategy” a lot longer than I am going to, but the most important thing is this: <strong>list your item for substantially more than you’d actually be OK receiving.</strong> Grailed allows you to bump your items every 7 days, or every time you drop the price by 10%. I usually price my items so that I could drop the price 3-5 times and still get an amount I’m OK with. Be aware that tons of people will make offers and then not pay once you’ve accepted. </p>

<p>Always remember that people are shitty and take all steps necessary to make sure you are covered by PayPal seller protection. Ship only to verified addresses and require a signature confirmation. <strong>Remember to put tracking information into the PayPal website and don’t just send it in a Grailed message.</strong> PayPal can be ridiculous when deciding disputes, and there are stories of people having sent the tracking in a message but PayPal refunding the buyer’s money because the seller never added it.</p>

<p><strong>Ebay</strong> </p>

<p>I don’t think I need to explain how eBay works to anyone. In terms of clothes, it’s particularly good for classic menswear and shoes but there are a ton of great deals on other stuff to. One of the most useful features is the ability to follow searches. For example, I like Stephan Schneider’s clothes so I search for his name and my size, and then follow the search by hitting <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nVkP91a.png">this button</a> right here. Now I’ll get an email every time something is added that fits those search terms. You might need to be more or less specific depending on what you’re looking for. Play around with it and see what best captures everything you want. Also keep an eye out for occasional promo codes from eBay or PayPal. </p>

<p>An additional helpful tip from <a href="/u/Metcarfre">/u/Metcarfre</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a side note on eBay, if you&#39;re interested in high-end traditional menswear (suits, leather shoes etc), Put This On has a bunch of pre-built searches that comb for an absurdly wide range of quality makers. Add a filter for your size and you&#39;re golden. I&#39;ve found sweet deals on shoes this way.</p>

<p>Also, know the marketplace. Trad menswear is way cheaper on Grailed than eBay. I&#39;ve found shell cordovan shoes for just over $100 shipped. Conversely, you can find designer/streetwear stuff surprisingly cheap on eBay if you dig.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>StyleForum</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.styleforum.net/f/6654/buying-and-selling">StyleForum Buying and Selling</a> has a ton of really great stuff, often at really good prices. The catch is that it has the worst interface in the world. There’s basically no way to filter by brand or by size or any of the useful options Grailed has. If you find something you like, you’ll need to have an SF account and then message the buyer to agree on a price. Again, don’t be a dick and always go through PayPal. </p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>

<p>Have a brand you like? Try and see if there is a Facebook buying and selling group for it. Some require an invite but I know a lot of posters on here are in them. If you&#39;re interested in a particular designer or brand, reach out to people here who wear a lot of it and see if they can help. </p>

<p><strong>Thrift Stores</strong></p>

<p>I’ve never personally had the patience to go thrifting on a regular basis, but there are quite a few posters here who have built really impressive wardrobes primarily thrifting. Keep in mind that finding designer clothes is very unlikely, and you’ll have to wade through a lot of ugly shit to find stuff you like. For more information, I’ll refer you to <a href="/u/jknowl3m">/u/jknowl3m</a> ‘s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1chu8v/as_promised_my_guide_to_thrifting/">thrifting guide</a> </p>

<p><strong>Consignment Stores</strong> </p>

<p>Consignment stores are like the expensive version of thrift stores. Look for local shops in your area but there are a few that operate online as well. <a href="https://www.therealreal.com">TheRealReal</a> has an amazing women’s selection and a somewhat mediocre men’s one. It’s still probably the best consignment store operating online. They are almost always running sales, and will give you promo credit just for opening an account. I wouldn’t buy anything without at least 20% off and 25 dollars in credit. There are other options like the <a href="http://www.vestiairecollective.com/new-items/men/">Vestiaire Collective</a> as well, but be warned that the shipping prices are practically criminal. </p>

<p><strong>Japan</strong></p>

<p>Proxying from Japan can be a great way to get stuff that would be otherwise hard to find or really expensive in the US. Being a giant, I don&#39;t find much in my size on Yahoo! Japan or Rakuten, so I&#39;m far from an authority on the process. As <a href="/u/thonyfst">/u/thonyfst</a> pointed out, there is already a guide <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/3ltryp/proxying_from_japan_an_introduction/">here</a> that I&#39;ll defer to. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I hope this was a useful, albeit basic, overview for how you can make buying expensive clothing a little more bearable. It’s a super rewarding hobby, and this guide only scratches the surface of it. As you get more and more into it, I’m sure you’ll find that you’ve picked up a million little tricks of your own. If you’re already knowledgeable about this sort of thing and feel that I’ve left something out, please feel free to add it below. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading and feel free to ask any questions &lt;3</p>

<h2>Waxing a cotton jacket - the results</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/yorog </span>

<div id="1c8h49" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the event that anyone is curious about waxing a coat or other apparel, here&#39;s how my little project turned out.</p>

<p>I picked up a cheap field jacket a couple of weeks ago and decided to wax it. Having never waxed a garment before, I was pretty hesitant. But, I figured if I didn&#39;t like the results I could just give it a few washes. After reading some info on different products and application methods, I went with the <a href="http://www.otterwax.com">Otter Wax</a> bar (which has been mentioned in other MFA posts before).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the jacket <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QHmKx2Sh.jpg">before</a>. And, here are the results after 48 hours of curing: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PpqstQUh.jpg">1</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kbW4mG4h.jpg">2</a></p>

<p>I think it turned out pretty well and I&#39;m pleased with the results. Sure, it&#39;s not as clean as a factory waxed Barbour or Orvis coat, but it does the job. </p>

<p>The otter wax was easy to apply (using the manufacturer&#39;s instructional video), but getting it perfectly even was difficult. I tried using a blow dryer to get an even coating but that was too tedious (a heat gun would probably work very well but I don&#39;t have one). I ended up being a Johnny Cut-Corners and stuck it in the dryer on low heat for about 15 minutes. The tumble dryer evened out the wax quite well and I didn&#39;t find any residue inside of the dryer afterwards.</p>

<p>The smell is rather unique--kind of a beeswax meets Pine Sol--and although I don&#39;t find it nauseating, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s pleasant either. After applying the wax, you can easily smell it from across the room. It&#39;s been over 48 hours since applying the wax and the smell is definitely less pungent and is really only noticeable if your face is right on it. I&#39;ll venture to guess that the smell will continue to fade over time. In regards to the water-proofing aspect, water beads up nicely on it as expected.</p>

<p>Has anyone else tried waxing a garment before? How did yours turn out?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all, after posting a few comments and a <a href="https://www.strawpoll.me/15086022">strawpoll</a> to gauge interest in a thread of this nature, here it is: The first (of many, hopefully.) MFA DIY megathread.</p>

<p>The point behind this thread is for people to post their male fashion-related DIYs that don&#39;t deserve their own dedicated thread. e.g. DIYs in which you only have the completed product/never thought to take WIP pics, Projects that were too small to warrant a thread (Dyeing something, for example.), etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to post about  DIYs you have planned/Questions you may have on how to execute a certain DIY. </p>

<p>The linkdump (Which will more than likely be moved to a pastebin if this gets enough traction to become a recurring thread.) is open to additions.</p>
