<p>Skin microbes¬†were engineered to express tumor antigens that could ‚Äúelicit T cells that were licensed by the commensal immune program but specific for a tumor,‚Äù including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In short: Brush some engineered bacteria on the skin, and they activate the immune system to go fight a tumor. Wow.  </p>

<p>Tobacco plants¬†were genetically-engineered to produce moth sex pheromones that can be harvested and then used as a natural form of pest control.  </p>

<p>Short DNA¬†strands were discovered that can specifically and tightly bind to zinc and cadmium ions.  </p>

<p>Protein-based materials, manufactured from living bacteria, were fused to mussel foot protein fragments to massively boost their strength and toughness (comparable to spider silk.)  </p>

<p>Hydra (freshwater animals) neurons were stimulated with light, and this caused the animals to do a somersault.  </p>

<p>A¬†computational algorithm, called ComPE, was used to create four SpCas9 variants that caused fewer off-target edits in the genome.  </p>

<p>Compact gene editors, called enOsCas12f1 and enRhCas12f1, are smaller than many existing Cas proteins and can be more easily delivered for gene therapies. The editing efficiencies of enOsCas12f1 and enRhCas12f1 were 54.7% and 23.3%, respectively, compared to just 14% for the prior Cas12f1 protein. enRhCas12f1 caused no detectable off-target edits. </p>

<button onclick="toggles(107)">View full post</button><div id="107" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to better understand the BioTech/Pharma space, and in particular what are the <strong>biggest challenges</strong> faced by wet-lab researchers in academia, as well as the pharma companies. For pharma, I&#39;d be interested to speak not only to scientists, but also with <strong>sales</strong> people, <strong>lab managers</strong>, <strong>admins</strong> as well as <strong>managerial roles</strong> (CEOs/CFOs of startups, etc ...).</p>

<p>In exchange, I will offer any advice/insights on latest developments in Machine Learning, AI and healthcare applications of ML. I&#39;ve just finished my postdoc at MIT in ML applications to neuroimaging, and I&#39;ve worked with statistical ML models during my PhD at UCL, London. I can give advice on multiple ML topics, but I&#39;ve particularly worked with deep learning, image analysis, statistical bayesian models and spatio-temporal models.</p>

<p>A few questions to get started:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does early drug screening work in pharma? What are the biggest challenges there?</li>
<li>How does a typical day of a wet-lab scientist look like? What is the most annoying thing?</li>
<li>Why do clinical trials keep failing in pharma companies?</li>
<li>How do pharma companies reach their customers? How are customers maintained? Here I&#39;m thinking social media/conferences/demos-at-various-events, and customers can be either patients, other pharma companies, or health insurance, etc ...</li>
<li>What are the primary sources of revenue in pharma companies? Do companies have revenue outside traditional sources (selling therapies/drugs)? E.g. government grants, or VCs? How common is it?</li>
<li>What are the common partnerships in the pharma space? Other academic labs, or startups? What is normally being exchanged (e.g. data, expertise, resources, money)</li>
</ol>

<p>Respond in comments below (if possible, state your current role and company/university you work for). You can also ask me anything about ML/AI and I will respond. I&#39;d prefer to eventually have phone conversations, but we can start with a short chat in the comments section or in Reddit&#39;s private chat.</p>

<h2>The Bottomless Pit of Potential: My Thoughts on The Shitshow in Biotech</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/factoryal21 </span><span class = "numcomments">69 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/12bo3r2/the_bottomless_pit_of_potential_my_thoughts_on/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(112)">View full post</button><div id="112" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The other day I was venting about my frustrations with the biotech industry to a software developer friend who works for a big tech company. Specifically, I was lamenting our spectacularly high failure rate for converting early stage ideas into something useful. He asked me the following question:</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Is your perception that these problems are tractable, but there are a million dead ends and one right path? Or that we&#39;re missing something fundamental in our approach to the whole process that we need to fill in before we&#39;ll ever see more than incremental innovation in only a few areas of lower-hanging fruit?</em>‚Äù</p>

<p>I ended up writing a short essay in response, and he suggested that I should share it with other people. I‚Äôm curious if my experiences resonate with anyone else here. For context, I‚Äôve been in the Boston biotech scene for about 9 years, working for small companies in the immunotherapy and cell/gene therapy fields, holding titles in the Associate Scientist-Senior Scientist range.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomless Pit of Potential: My Thoughts on The Shitshow in Biotech</strong></p>

<p>The problems we‚Äôre trying to solve are hard, and there&#39;s an inherent risk that any well-intentioned idea for how to solve them may just not work out. The issue isn‚Äôt that the science is challenging, though, it&#39;s the way the industry responds to those challenges. I think if I had to highlight the single biggest problem, it would be with the financial incentive structures at all levels: individual, corporate, industry wide. It leads to all sorts of problems. I&#39;m sure this is not unique to biotech but here is my perspective. </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Individual</strong></p>

<p>We are often incentivized to work on projects that are best for our careers, not which are scientifically interesting. Generally, in order to come up with something really new and interesting, you need to take a significant amount of risk. The risk of failure at an individual level is not just that someone in management may be disappointed or angry that you had an unproductive year (although that is definitely a concern), it&#39;s also an opportunity cost. Currently, in biotech, we deal with a tremendous amount of career mobility and employment volatility. Many of the resumes I look at show candidates that are working 1 year, 2 year stints at like, 5 different companies, and that&#39;s their entire career. My own resume is 4 years, 2 years, 2 years, 1 year, despite my best intentions to stay longer at each of these jobs.</p>

<p>This means that one of the most important skills you have is your ability to get a new job. If you just spent the last 2 years shitting the bed on a loser project, it hurts your ability to get a new job. This is a really important concept because even if your company is totally cool with the fact that you&#39;re working on something new and experimental and it may not work, and you spin wheels for two years and management is supportive, it‚Äôs still a bad situation. You need to cultivate a resume that shows you can generate value, so you need to work on projects that go somewhere, because you might need to find a job tomorrow and you have nothing to show for the last two years of your life. </p>

<p>And of course, you can have both types of risk at the same time: management can get pissed and also you develop a resume weak point. It creates situations where someone wants to leave a project not because it isn&#39;t interesting or important, but because it feels unsafe.</p>

<p>When I was at [Company A], there was this project nobody wanted to work on because we were all really skeptical that it was going to work, and none of us trusted the management team to handle failure responsibly and respectfully. They had already basically demoted and shelved one scientist who had failed to make progress on that project. I had several conversations with people who felt the same way: basically, they didn&#39;t want to be left holding the bag, so they bailed on the company rather than keep working on that project. Interestingly, what happened with that project is that they never were able to get it to work as originally intended, but they were able to move the goalposts and make something out of it. So basically they fucked with that person&#39;s career needlessly. In her case, her mistake was not bailing on that project early enough. It would have been the right decision to take a shorter stint at [Company A] and move on. This also leads to an issue where companies can struggle to retain people unless they&#39;re on a good project that feels safe and stable, which means project ownership might change hands several times over the life of a project and this can cause all sorts of confusion and problems. That [Company A] project has had, to my knowledge, at least 3 project leaders in 3 years (I was one), two of which were sort of leading the project at the same time for a while with no clear division of labor, and they have reported to a rotating assortment of about 6 bosses in that same period (three nice bosses, one sketchy boss, one useless middle manager, and one absolute hellspawn).</p>

<p><strong>Corporate</strong></p>

<p>Companies often get trapped in local minimums. They work on something for a certain period of time, and then they need to move it to the next stage and stop refining it, so that they (or at least, the investors) can extract value from the undertaking. The decision to put the tech into play, versus to keep developing it, is usually a financially motivated decision that sucks scientifically. This may be more specific to biotech because once you put something into clinical development, it becomes very difficult (if not impossible) to make changes or upgrades, so at a certain point you need to commit to an approach and then you&#39;re locked in. The consequences of this trend are being felt hard right now, there are a ton of small biotech companies who went public in the last few years and are now trading below their IPO price. Part of that has to do with the broader economic climate right now, but part of it is that all these companies get pushed to rush their tech out as fast as possible to bring the company to a value inflection point and IPO so the early investors can harvest and exit. When that happens, there&#39;s a pretty good chance that the tech isn&#39;t really ready to stand on its own. Venture capitalists were taking advantage of previous economic conditions to quickly fund, pump up, and exit these companies for a profit. The actual technology almost doesn&#39;t matter. Some of those ideas were probably pretty good and now may never get followed up on because the companies are collapsing, since in order to be on trajectory for the IPO they needed to grow their work force, move into larger and more expensive lab space, and spend big money on expensive manufacturing contracts to be prepared for clinical entry. And then suddenly their stock tanks and they can&#39;t afford any of that anymore. If the idea was solid, the IP may eventually get recycled, most likely by a larger company, but it might take years or even decades because its difficult to pitch investing in an idea that just crashed and burned for some other company.</p>

<p>At [Company B], the antibody that the company sent into the clinic was definitely not the best one we could have made. In fact, there was some pretty clear data that it wasn&#39;t a very good antibody, and didn&#39;t even fundamentally work by the mechanism the company said it did (and still says it does). But, time was up, so the company buried the bad data, pushed out the people who were advocating to keep developing the antibody, and moved it to the clinical stage. Where, predictably, the antibody failed to do anything useful for patients. But before it failed, it let them have a nice IPO, and raise a whole bunch of money from a big corporate partnership deal. I&#39;m pretty sure that partnership money is the only reason [Company B] was able to survive financially, so....I guess it was the right decision?</p>

<p>At [Company A], the company&#39;s technology platform was supposed to be the entire point. This was how the company was going to build and demonstrate value. But the minute that we had something that looked like it could be a product, leadership basically scuttled work on the platform (the underlying technology) and focused on getting this product out the door. This happened through a semi-hostile transition where the board ousted the previous leadership and installed a new CEO and COO to implement the change in business strategy. The trick is, we really hadn&#39;t gotten the technology to work yet, but they found an application where this new technology didn&#39;t really need to work in order for the product to be successful (in theory). It looks like this project may actually be successful (I&#39;ve heard its going well, it has the potential to be an improvement over the treatments that exist for certain subsets of patients), which means it was a reasonable decision, but to me its kind of sad because I think that the underlying technology could be advanced a lot more and its not clear if that&#39;s going to happen or not. [Company A]&#39;s technology has the potential to really unlock some very interesting approaches which we haven&#39;t been able to access yet as a field, at least not effectively. But really, the product that [Company A] is advancing out the door doesn&#39;t make use of the technology platform at all, although they try very hard not to admit that. It could have been made with a much simpler approach and it would basically do the same thing, [Company A]&#39;s secret sauce isn&#39;t really doing anything to contribute to the overall effect. The 3 years of work that went into building the technology platform were kind of a waste. </p>

<p>So basically, they took the fastest path they could see to a product that has a nice business profile and that will probably work and offer a marginal improvement for some patients, instead of trying to develop something more advanced and revolutionary. Not that I want to imply that marginal improvements can&#39;t be good, or important, but I think [Company A] could have made something much more impactful if they got the core tech to a more mature state. I hope that eventually they find success with the lead program and re-invest the winnings into the technology platform and start making the kind of things we had originally been hoping for. But who knows. Right now all their resources are going to be tied up in the clinical approach, so if that fails (which is the most common outcome for a clinical trial) the company could be in trouble and that technology could go nowhere, despite having never been actually finished and tested for real. I‚Äôll emphasize that again: this promising idea, which has the potential to revolutionize the field, may quite possibly be written off as a failure despite never really being tested or properly implemented, and it all comes down to a clinical trial dice roll. This is madness.</p>

<p><strong>Industry</strong></p>

<p>When one group gets a good result, the whole field jumps on that idea and tries to rip it off, because you can raise money to work on that idea because there is some evidence that it has already worked. And then the majority of these ‚Äúdo it the same but make it a little better‚Äù ideas end up being bad (this is what my third company was doing) because the barrier to entry was relatively low, so it was easy to get funded even with shaky fundamentals. If the whole show was being run by a single sane operator, you could just rationally sort through the pool of ideas for making it a little better and test them systematically, but the show is being run by executives and lawyers and everyone has to color inside the lines of their own intellectual property.</p>

<p>There ends up being a tremendous amount of repetitive waste through unproductive competition, since one company is trying to copy another company‚Äôs work and then add a new little bit to it, and they basically just need to do the work over again. And often times they screw it up since there&#39;s very little incentive in industry to communicate the real nitty-gritty details of how experiments are being done. So you have a situation where 5 companies are all trying copy the work of a 6th company in parallel, and 2 of them are doing it incorrectly and releasing data at conferences that&#39;s confusing the hell out of everyone else, and there isn&#39;t a large enough clinical niche for all of them to exist simultaneously in the market, so the 4 slowest companies will fail and will have done that work to no useful effect anyways. Meanwhile, the early investors who funded those 4 failed companies don&#39;t care because they failed after their IPOs and the early investors got out early and flipped that investment for a profit, and even if they didn&#39;t they can just keep raising more money for their funds by taking on inexpensive debt due to low interest rates. In theory someone lost, but it‚Äôs not clear who that was, probably a banker or a big pharma partner so who cares right? The people working at those 4 companies quit and get new jobs at 4 new companies spun up by the same VCs, and often times run by the same people, and the cycle continues. </p>

<p>Until one day, inexplicably, in a move nobody could see coming, the bankers and big pharma companies decides to stop investing in this farce because the economy is tanking and suddenly the fact that the substantial majority of these investments are bad has become a problem (we have arrived at the present day). To be clear they haven&#39;t stopped investing completely but man has it slowed down from a few years ago.</p>

<p>So when I look at all the possibilities for things we could do with cell therapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy, it feels less like looking into the future, and more like staring into the void. Not because the problems seem unsolvable, but because the process of solving them is just so ridiculous and painful for stupid reasons. So...a bottomless pit of potential.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(147)">View full post</button><div id="147" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently working as a PhD level bench scientist in industry. I enjoy that I can listen to podcasts all day in lab but I have a broad set of interests and I think I would enjoy learning more about business. I am not sure I am as intensely interested in just science as many of my colleagues seem to be. A few people have told me to consider consulting since it would allow me to learn more about business and also to work my way up faster in biotech.</p>

<p>Has anyone here gone to consulting from being a bench scientist and if so can you tell me about your experience?</p>

<p>I am 2.5 years into my career working revenue operations for a large tech startup with strong analytic, process improvement, and digital transformation experience. </p>

<p>I studied experimental Psych and Neuroscience at non-top tier school with somewhat good grades (3.7 gpa). Some research experience but none biotech focused. </p>

<p>I am targeting the life science firms like Clarion, BCG, LEK, etc and am interested in portfolio prioritization/strategy, market analysis, etc. </p>

<p>Most applications don‚Äôt even receive a reply, does anyone have advice on what their next steps would be? Masters in biotech, MBA, MBA with a biotech focus (there are only a few and pretty exclusive from what I see), MHA, MPh? Or should I try to work my way in through getting a job with a pharma company? I worry that my lack of a scientific background will hold me back even with an MBA. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice on the best next steps?</p>

I‚Äôve gotten several offers from T20 programs at this point, some with better name recognition that others. Overall, what‚Äôs the most important metric for breaking into consulting with a PhD? Recognition of the name of school? Proximity to NYC/Boston/SF? Quality of business school attached to university?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>what to do with the boring quiet times in between work?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(208)">View full post</button><div id="208" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I am a scientist at a biotech company.  Sometimes, in between project and work loads, I get rhis really boring quiet times where I do not know what to do with myself. I like to be active, but I get very overwhelmed by all the possibilities and shut down.</p>

<p>I bet this must happen to other people. How do you deal with this? Do you try to learn new things? </p>

<p>I am guessing I am asking of good skills to learn in between those quiet and boring times at work. Any suggestions? </p>

<p>P.S. When you look things online, it&#39;s hard to find things targeted to lab related work. I also don&#39;t work from home, so most suggestions online don&#39;t work</p>

<h2>r/biotech salary survey testing/feedback</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(209)">View full post</button><div id="209" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Message received. With some procrastination and toying around, i thought maybe using Google Sheets and Forms might be best. Then we can start really analyzing our pay and make pretty graphs/charts.</p>

<p>Please feel free to test and provide feedback of the form and spreadsheet where the data is. If there are any other additional questions we can integrate lets do it.</p>

<p>Idea for the survey is to keep it up year round and then post a fresh one every year. I opted to keep this sheet entirely anonymous (no sign-on required) in the hopes people wont be an idiot and submit their salaries 4 times.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll keep this post up for a week for feedback, with a target launch in less than two weeks.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/wXFNsuHmzQUrtRD88">Link to Form</a></p>
