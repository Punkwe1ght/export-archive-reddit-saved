<h2>Aussie Homelab - Running our Gaming Community</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(162)">View full post</button><div id="162" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, just sharing my homelab. Long time lurker and thought to share some of my work.</p>

<p>This bad boy features Unifi equipment, ATX PC desktop cases custom built to work in a rack mountable position, a Mikrotik router and firewall, switch, NAS (RAID5) with hot spares etc. There&#39;s two APC UPS tucked away at the bottom also (I am hoping to get a rack mountable one soon)</p>

<p>The two machines 001 and 002 are running up to 4 virtual machines each each with a dedicated NIC running on a VLAN to segregate the traffic from our community and gaming servers away from our home traffic.</p>

<p>I use/do things like Hyper-V, Pi-Hole, Plex, Ubuntu, Windows Server, Laravel, HeidiSQL, Uptime Kuma, Web development, Dev Ops, OPSEC to name a few. I love this setup- it&#39;s allowed me to learn and built more than I have ever needed thus far and I continue to expand. Aside from hosting our home network, gaming community and servers, its helped me learn and experienent along the way!</p>

<p>I plan to built another server into the lower chassis that is currently an empty shell, and also one day take it all down.. and give it a black paint job.</p>

<p>Comments, feedback, questions, anything at all if you&#39;re curious and ill do my best to answer you all when/where I can.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone,</p>

<p>Xevrac.</p>

<h2>Deep learning build update</h2>

Temps are great after limited testing, but it&#39;s a work in progress. </p>

<p>Im trying to find a good deal on a long pcie riser cable for the 5th GPU but I got 4 of them working. I also have a nvme to pcie 16x adapter coming to test. I might be able to do 6x m40 GPUs in total.</p>

<p>I found suitable atx fans to put behind the cards and I&#39;m now going to create a &quot;shroud&quot; out of cardboard or something that covers the cards and promotes airflow from the fans. So far with just the fans the temps have been promising. </p>

<p>On a side note, I am looking for a data/pytorch guy that can help me with standing up models and tuning. in exchange for unlimited computer time on my hardware. I&#39;m also in the process of standing up a 3 or 4x RTX 3090 rig.</p>

<p>I use unique e-mail aliases for all services to know if they sell my e-mail or get compromised so I can easily swap them out If I get a ton of spam.</p>

<p>I did not register to any newsletter with the given e-mail and also privacy protection is on for each domain so it is not leaked via whois information, I double checked that.</p>

<p>Starting today I already got 3 spam e-mails.</p>

<p>I also checked the mail source, the e-mails where directly send from a hijacked aws ses account. They are not coming from the privacy service.</p>

<p>Very unhappy with that outcome given that I paid more then 200$ for renewals, whish it had gotten another registrar which respects my privacy.</p>

<p>Setup a Windows VM, install a GPU, share with VM through pci pass through and then use e.g. Steam Streaming to game on that VM.</p>

<p>Has anyone tried that? Are the obvious reasons why this might be a bad idea?</p>

<h2>Smart Home and Homelab network diagram after 4 years of evolution</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/FoxxMD </span><span class = "numcomments">130 comments </span><a href="/r/homelab/comments/zlxqm5/smart_home_and_homelab_network_diagram_after_4/j07qwyl/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(328)">View full post</button><div id="328" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Everyone loves a good network diagram.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/mwwn92/first_time_actually_laying_out_the_whole_network/">last diagram I posted here from april 2021.</a> After a recent hardware failure I shuffled many services around and added new machines so I figured it was time for an update.</p>

<p>There is a ton of detail on services and usage in the previous thread so please check that out! I am here all day and happy to answer any questions.</p>

<p>Here is a quick FAQ based on stuff from the last thread:</p>

<hr/>

<h3>How did you make the diagram?</h3>

<p>It&#39;s made with <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>. The generic icons can be found by including more icon sets from the <em>More Shapes</em> button. All other images are just copy/pasted from google.</p>

<h3>Do you have a static IP?</h3>

<p>No. I currently use <a href="https://ddclient.net">dd-client</a> to update cloudflare dyndns. Planning to switch to doing this straight on the unifi gateway.</p>

<h3>Why different IP address/subnets? What are VLANs?</h3>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/mwwn92/first_time_actually_laying_out_the_whole_network/gvozgzy/">See this answer from the previous thread</a></p>

<h3>What server chassis is that?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-r4000u-black/p/9SIA072GJ92805">Rosewill RSV-L4500</a>. I do recommend it but I wish I had the hot swap HDD cage version.</p>

<h3>Why are the services organized the way they are?</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve tiered how &quot;mission critical&quot; a service is to provide physical separation in case of hardware failure and also potential uptime during a power outage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi

<ul>
<li>Lowest power (will run hours during outage)</li>
<li>Most stable machine I depend on for network access if I&#39;m out the house...</li>
<li>In the event of SW/HW failure VPN won&#39;t go down</li>
<li>For power outage I can assess the situation and potentially restart machines if power comes back</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cougar

<ul>
<li>Low-ish power (will run for 10-20 minutes during outage)</li>
<li>More stable than Rosewill due to newer hardware and isolated VMs</li>
<li>For &quot;mission-critical&quot; public services that redditors rely on</li>
<li>For internally &quot;important&quot; services/infrastructure like unifi and Home Assistant</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rosewill (unraid)

<ul>
<li>High power due to old CPU and many HDDs (will run for 5-10 minutes during outage)</li>
<li>Least stable due to</li>
<li><em>Many</em> services sharing HW on same host OS</li>
<li>Docker is reliant on unraid array being online</li>
<li>I use it as a sandbox for testing new apps IE it should be ok if it goes down due to tinkering</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;d also like to thank the shoulders of giants I&#39;ve stood on to get to this point in my homelab journey:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/r/homelab">/r/homelab</a> for being the MVP on all things lab knowledge</li>
<li><a href="/r/homelabsales">/r/homelabsales</a> for being an invaluable market for this hobby</li>
<li><a href="/r/selfhosted">/r/selfhosted</a> for all the incredible projects shared and help from users</li>
<li><a href="/u/Fozman2">/u/Fozman2</a> for gifting a 2GB UDIMM to me in 2018 in order to test compatibility on a Phenom motherboard -- it opened the door to homelabbing for me</li>
<li><a href="/u/blockofdynamite">/u/blockofdynamite</a> for the xeon CPUs I used in my OG supermicro build that <em>really</em> opened the floodgates for me</li>
<li><a href="/u/karmaawhoree">/u/karmaawhoree</a> for 2x 6TB HDDs used in unraid today</li>
<li><a href="/u/MacDaddyBighorn">/u/MacDaddyBighorn</a> for 2x 1.5TB in use in my dev machine</li>
<li><a href="/u/EvilDrM">/u/EvilDrM</a> for offering a google coral to me in my time of need</li>
</ul>

<h2>TeamViewer Alternative</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(336)">View full post</button><div id="336" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a big problem. I have been using TeamViewer for years to access my headless servers, but yesterday evening it decided to think I was using it for commercial purposes. I called support and filled out the form and everything, but I am basically screwed until they reinstate my free account.</p>

<p>As soon as they reinstate my free account, the first thing I am doing is switch to another Remote Desktop service. Any recommendations? I have wanted to switch to something selfhosted for a while now, but I avoided it because I need to be able to remote into computers even when the selfhosted VM might now be working. Since a Remote Desktop service is so important to have always working for me, I would really like a cloud service, but I don‚Äôt know if any that offer the same features as TeamViewer for free.</p>
