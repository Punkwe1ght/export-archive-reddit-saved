<h2>(Spoilers All) Stannis did nothing wrong</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Stannis is still The Mannis. Everyone is all up in arms about how Stannis is a heartless bastard and that it was completely out of character and how they want to get off the Mannistrain. If this makes you get off the Mannistrain then you must not have went on it for reasons relating to The Mannis character, and only for &quot;lol GET HYPE!&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel that Stannis&#39; decision in this episode was completely in line with his character, and that he did the right decision. First let&#39;s take a look at what we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stannis&#39; camp ravaged by the good men</li>
<li>Not enough men and supplies to secure the battle against the Boltons</li>
<li>Not enough supplies to return to Castle Black, and anyway retreating is not an option for Stannis</li>
<li>Death is imminent for them all unless something special happens</li>
<li>Blood magic has been shown multiple times to be real and working</li>
<li>Kingsblood is the strongest blood, and is readily available in Shireen</li>
</ul>

<p>We know Stannis puts his duty to the realm before everything else. He needs to defeat the Boltons and continue on to finally sit the Iron Throne. He is the one person in pursue of the throne that cares about the White Walker threat and actually wants to help the Night&#39;s Watch. </p>

<p>If he&#39;d have continued on to Winterfell he&#39;d surely lose the battle, which would result in Shireen dying.
If he&#39;d have turned back to Castle Black, chances are they would all starve and freeze to death, which also results in Shireen dying.</p>

<p>By sacrificing Shireen he gets an advantage in the upcoming battle, and as we can see from the next episode preview the sacrifice worked. Sacrificing Shireen also works into Stannis = AA, making this his Nissa Nissa sacrifice.</p>

<p>We also know that Stannis thinks about the bigger picture and the greater good, as this quote from ASOS that&#39;s been posted a bunch now shows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty … If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark … Sacrifice … is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If sacrificing Shireen will help him to save the kingdom, when the option is to get slaughtered by Bolton-fucking-shits, it&#39;s nothing weird with Stannis doing this. He knows his duty is towards the kingdom, even if that conflicts with his own feelings. It&#39;s completely in line with his character I think. He does what is needed of him, what the kingdom needs of him, even if it&#39;s extremely hard and painful. And that is why he is still our Mannis.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>I have seen some similar posts in the past, but none are up to date and most fail to mention the unnamed blades or provide enough detail on those that are named. Speculation is limited to the &quot;predictions&quot; point of each section. Here we go!</em></p>

<p><strong>1. Heartsbane</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Tarly of the Reach</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell Tarly (current; stolen from his father in show)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Oldtown with Sam (show only), King’s Landing with Randyll (books)</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: two-handed greatsword (one of 3), which is a fitting weapon for Westeros’ most powerful military house.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Sam will study Heartsbane at Oldtown to understand the properties of Valyrian steel and other higher mysteries.</p>

<p><strong>2. Lady Forlorn</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Corbray of the Vale</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: King <del>Robert</del> Robar II Royce (wielded during the Battle of the Seven Stars; later defeated), Ser Gwayne Corbray (wielded during the First Blackfyre Rebellion, later defeated), unnamed Lord Corbray (father of Lyn; defeated at the Battle of the Trident), Ser Lyn Corbray (current; taken off Lord Corbray’s corpse at the Trident and used to exact revenge on his father’s killer)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: The Vale with Ser Lyn Corbray</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: longsword, with a heart shaped ruby in its pommel</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: (books only) Will be integral in protecting the Vale when the Others finally breach the Bloody Gate; although, as with all the previous wielders of Lady Forlon, I think their defenses will ultimately fail.</p>

<p><strong>3. Longclaw</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Mormont of Bear Island</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Jeor Mormont, Jorah Mormont (given back to his father after his failures), Jon Snow (given to him by Jeor Mormont after killing a wight and saving his life)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: The Wall with Jon (books); Winterfell with Jon (show)</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Bastard sword (mixed between long and great); coincidentally given to “a bastard”. Has a bear’s head on the pommel; the pommel is later damaged during the wight attack and replaced by a snarling wolf&#39;s head of pale stone with chips of garnet for the eyes.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Jorah, who is already devoted to Dany, will also devote himself to Jon upon seeing Longclaw and learning of why it is in Jon’s possession. Jorah will be important in the alliance between Ice (Jon) and fire (Dany). Longclaw will be an important sword, possibly THE most important, in the Battle for the Dawn; according to prophecy, Longclaw may likely be damaged and reforged into Lightbringer (other Lightbringer possibility is a reforged Ice).</p>

<p><strong>4. Nightfall</strong> </p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Harlaw of the Iron Islands</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Dalton Greyjoy (taken from a dead pirate), Ser Harras Harlaw (current)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: At Greyshield with Harras</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Longsword with a moonstone pommel. Unknown how the sword was passed to House Harlaw.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Doesn’t seem that House Harlaw has any particularly strong claim to this sword by most Westerosi standards, but among Iron Islanders, they paid the iron price; Euron is currently using Harras as a pawn, and we know how much Euron loves anything Valyrian. For these reasons, I believe Euron will eventually steal and wield Nightfall.</p>

<p><strong>5. Red Rain</strong> </p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Drumm of the Iron Islands (only recently; possibly belonged to House Reyne before)</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Hilmar Drumm (came into possession during a raid after stealing it from an armored knight using nothing but his wits and a wooden cudgel), Lord Dunstan Drumm (current)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Old Wyk with Lord Dunstan Drumm</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: The steel of this longsword is colored red.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: To be stolen by Euron. Euron will dual-wield Red Rain and Nightfall, the two Valyrian swords of the Iron Islands. Or will wield one and use the other for magic sacrificial/ritualistic purposes.</p>

<p><strong>6. Oathkeeper</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: None; only recently reforged from Ice, the ancestral greatsword of House Stark.</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Jamie Lannister (briefly), Brienne of Tarth (given to Brienne by Jamie to find Sansa Stark, at which point it was named Oathkeeper)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: The Riverlands with Brienne</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Lion’s head pommel with ruby eyes</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: At some point after Brienne fufills her oath, Oathkeeper will be reforged with Widow’s Wail back into Ice (which may or may not eventually become Lightbringer).</p>

<p><strong>7. Widow&#39;s Wail</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: None; only recently reforged from Ice, the ancestral greatsword of House Stark</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Joffrey Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon (current, books), Cersei Lannister (assumed current, show-only)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: King’s Landing</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Longsword with ripples of red and black steel; the scabbard is gaudily decorated with gold, cherrywood, red leather, and rubies.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Jamie will use Widow’s Wail to kill Cersei, fulfilling the Valonqar prophecy; a fitting death for this scheming widow.</p>

<p><strong>8. Ice</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Stark</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: All of the Lords of House Stark for the past 400 years, Lord Eddard Stark (last wielder)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: nonexistent</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: One of three greatswords (others being Brightroar and Heartsbane). Remade into two swords for House Lannister by Tobho Mott.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Will be reforged from Oathkeeper and Widow’s Wail and used again in the new Battle for the Dawn, the original battle being the legacy it was named for.</p>

<p><strong>9. Petyr&#39;s unnamed dagger</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Baelish, House Baratheon</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Petyr Baelish (current), Robert Baratheon (won during a bet), Bran Stark’s failed assassin</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: The Vale with Petyr Baelish, who took it off of Ned in the throne room.</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: dragonbone hilt; used during a failed assassination of Bran Stark and later blamed on Tyrion
-<em>Predictions</em>: Littlefinger will be killed with his own dagger</p>

<p><strong>10. Valyrian steel arakh</strong> </p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: Unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Caggo, a Dothraki and captain of the Windblown</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: In Essos/Meereen with Caggo</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Not much is known of this arakh</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Reforged from Blackfyre. Last we know of Blackfyre, Aegor “Bittersteel” Rivers claimed the sword from the Redgrass Field before fleeing to Essos and forming the Golden Company. Caggo, a sellsword and captain of the Windblown, could have easily come across Blackfyre when working with/against other sellswords. As a Dothraki, it is his way to steal the treasure off his defeated foes and display them proudly.</p>

<p><strong>11. Blackfyre</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Targaryen</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Aegon I, all Targaryen kings until Aegon IV, Daemon Blackfyre, Aegon ‘Bittersteel’ Rivers (last known wielder)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Bastard sword; <del>again fitting as it became named after the bastard branch of the Targaryens.</del> Bittersteel fled to Essos with Blackfyre and formed the Golden Company. EDIT: Redditors have corrected me in that the bastard branch was named for the sword, not the other way around. Thanks, guys!</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Stolen and remade into the Valyrian steel arakh owned by Caggo. The blacksmiths of Qohor (the city of sorcerers) could have assisted Caggo with this.</p>

<p><strong>12. Brightroar</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Lannister</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: King Tommen II Lannister (last known wielder)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Valyria</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Greatsword, only other known besides Ice and Heartsbane</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: I believe that Tyrion’s favorite uncle, Gerion Lannister, found Brighroar when he sailed to Valyria looking for it and soon after became the Shrouded Lord. Evidence: the Shrouded Lord controls the stone men. When three stone men jump aboard the Shy Maid, Tyrion’s life is spared. Tyrion dreams that the Shrouded Lord looks like his father, Tywin.</p>

<p><strong>13. Dark Sister</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Targaryen</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Visenya Targaryen, Daemon (used in the War of the Stepstones and won the hand of Laena Valeryon; used again in the dance of dragons to defeat Prince Aemond and his dragon Caraxes), Aemon Targaryen, Brynden “Bloodraven” Rivers (last known wielder)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Unknown, probably north of the wall with Bloodraven</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Thought to be created by a woman, as the hilt is slim and designed for a woman’s hand</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Will almost certainly be involved in the Battle for the Dawn in the books (probably won’t appear in the show). Not enough information to predict who will wield it, but I hope it will be Tyrion; I have absolutely no evidence for this except he has a dark sister that made him stronger and smaller than average hands.</p>

<p><strong>14. Lamentation</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Royce</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Ser Willum Royce (lost in the Storming of the Dragonpit)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: not much is known of Lamentation</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: not enough known to make any predictions, though I do believe we will get some backstory before it is wielded again by House Royce during the Battle for the Dawn</p>

<p><strong>15. Orphan-Maker</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Roxton</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Ser Jon Roxton (last known wielder; won many battles during the dance of dragons, but was eventually killed by Hugh Hammer’s men in a 10-1 fight.)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Not much is known about Orphan-Maker. It has a black blade.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: House Roxton fell out of favor when it remained loyal to the Targaryeans during Robert’s Rebellion. When Dany returns to Westeros, they will stand up for her, and Orphan-Maker will reappear.</p>

<p><strong>16. Truth</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Rogare</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Moredo Rogare of Lys</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: probably Lys, owner unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: The Rogares were a rich banking family in Lys of Valyrian decent.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Uncovering the location and story of “truth” will reveal many truths. Currently not enough information to make a guess as to what that backstory is.</p>

<p><strong>17. Vigilance</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Hightower</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: Lord Ormund Hightower (during the dance of dragons, last known wielder)</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: Oldtown, presumably</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Lord Ormund died with Vigilance at the Battle of Tumbleton; it is unknown what happened to Vigilance thereafter.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: If the Battle for the Dawn is at Oldtown, as many suspect, we will certainly see Vigilance make an appearance.</p>

<p><strong>18. Valyrian steel axe</strong></p>

<p>-<em>Ancestral House</em>: House Celtigar</p>

<p>-<em>Known Wielders</em>: unknown</p>

<p>-<em>Current location</em>: reputedly at Claw Isle</p>

<p>-<em>Other notes</em>: Not much is known of the Valyrian steel axe.</p>

<p>-<em>Predictions</em>: Won’t even appear in the show. In the books, there’s a recurring theme that “history repeats itself”. The Celtigars played an important role in the dance of dragons. We will have ADOD part 2, and they, along with the axe, will play a role, although this time that role may not be as large.</p>

<p><em>Please feel free to provide input and make your own predictions. Have any of these been mentioned in prophecy? What mysteries have yet to be uncovered about these weapons? Any guesses as to how some of these weapons got their names? Which weapon is your favorite? What would you name your own Valyrian steel blade?</em></p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold! Glad the list has brought some entertainment to your day.
Edit2: WOTW leaked the in-show location of well-known Valyrian sword. Won&#39;t fill this post with leaked info, so head there if you are interested!</p>
