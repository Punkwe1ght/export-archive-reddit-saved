<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right.  You&#39;re not seeing wrong.  1000 years of holidaying in FM15, in just England.  I started this on March 4th and it took 58 days of simming to get to 1000 years.  And now that it&#39;s all over and the data is all compiled, I thought I&#39;d share it with this sub, because why not?  So, let us begin.  </p>

<p>Now showing you the results of the PL, FA Cup and so on in ingame screenshots would take far too long, so I compiled a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ImEn6r9CW2VcrP-Gm2S6Ymx3QlM5F5umlpXz7x2YQTI/edit#gid=0">massive spreadsheet</a> which showed how many times each club won, or placed second or third in, each of the major competitions in England, and also the EL and CL.  I used a points system to determine which club was the best all time, using the system as follows.  </p>

<p>PL 1st Place-5</p>

<p>PL 2nd Place-3</p>

<p>PL 3rd Place-1</p>

<p>FA Cup Win-5</p>

<p>FA Cup Runner-Up-2</p>

<p>League Cup Win-4</p>

<p>League Cup Runner-Up-1</p>

<p>Champions League Win-6</p>

<p>Champions League Runner-Up-3</p>

<p>Europa League Win-4</p>

<p>Europa League Runner-Up-1.5</p>

<p>I also documented how many seasons a club played in the Premier Division, though this had no effect on points.  Note that I didn&#39;t include results that happened before the start date.  Since a screenshot history would be long and arduous, here is a brief rundown of the Premier League, 2014-3015.  </p>

<p>2000s: The first surprise of the sim, was Derby winning the Premier League in 2021 with Southampton coming in 3rd.  They fell pretty quickly, but then a surprisingly dominant Stoke took over, trading titles with Man U and occasionally Newcastle.  Coventry also had a dominant spell, winning 6 titles in 7 years.  Arsenal and Burnley entered the mix as contenders as well as Nottingham Forest and Blackburn.  The century ended with a very dominant Man U.</p>

<p>2100s: This century started with a very powerful Stoke, as they won 7 titles in a row as well as 14 titles in 17 years.  Later, Burnley became dominant as the PL turned into a power struggle between the 2 teams.  Newcomers West Brom and Barnsley also stole some titles, especially Barnsley, who won quite a few in the last couple decades.  </p>

<p>2200s: With Stoke on the decline, a newcomer fills their spot: Sheffield United.  They traded titles mostly with Man U, though later with Barnsley and Southend United.  This century had no real dominance, as teams struggled to string titles together.  Though teams such as MK Dons, Hull, and Plymouth came and went, the five big players were Sheffield, Arsenal, Barnsley, Southend, and Burnley.  </p>

<p>2300s: Southend replaced Sheffield&#39;s position of dominance, winning many titles early on.  Cambridge, Chesterfield, and Hull were also contenders.  7 titles in a row marked an all-time high for Southend, as they hammered their opposition for the rest of the century, with occasional wins from Brighton, Barnsley, and Man City.  </p>

<p>2400s: This century brought about Sunderland into relevance, who battled furiously with Southend, though small bouts of prowess from Sheffield, Man City, and Cambridge prodded them into relevance.  Burnley also had a very good mid-century.  Bristol Rovers, Reading, and Arsenal were also prominent late century.  </p>

<p>2500s: This century started with battles between QPR, Burnley, and Southend for the title.  Later, Plymouth, Tottenham, and Exeter were quite good, and even Barnsley was back.  Sheffield tore up the PL mid-century including 8 titles in 9 seasons.  A resurgent Arsenal ended the century.  </p>

<p>2600s: This century followed similar to previous ones.  Sheffield, Barnsley, Burnley, Southend, and Arsenal battled for the title, with occasional visits from other clubs into the top spot, including Sheffield Wednesday, Preston, Rotherham, and Plymouth.  Later in the century, a dominant Crystal Palace won title after title, which amounted to 15 wins in 26 years.  </p>

<p>2700s: Burnley started this century off with a bang, winning 7 in a row right off the bat.  Burnley dominance continued with challenges from Plymouth, Liverpool, and Norwich.  However Sheffield Utd. took their place with 10 titles in 11 seasons and ended the century in that way, along with wins from Brentford and Preston.  </p>

<p>2800s: The 2800s, or the dark years as I call them, started with Sheffield Utd. and Rotherham being the only 2 title winners for 30 years straight.  And who stopped them?  Burnley, with 10 successive titles.  Arsenal finally broke the bore spell, which brought in new face Bromley, as well as Maidstone and QPR.  </p>

<p>2900s and 3000s: The last century starts with a feud between Bromley and Burnley, which is broken up by Rotherham.  This battle continues through until a resurgent Hull gets in the way.  This opens the door for Brentford, Ipswich, and Man City to become regular title contenders.  The 3000s turn into a struggle between Brentford, Ipswich, and Nottingham Forest with the very last title ever going to Hull City.  </p>

<p>Of course I didn&#39;t just do England.  I payed attention to the World Cup too, the spreadsheet of which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JYRxMR_SQQK9f3iBTLDu2xWm6f9ld6XmvIm2CSaRO4c/edit#gid=0">here</a>.  Two interesting things I noticed was how powerful Venezuela and Ecuador became.  England is also far and away the best nation (most likely due to me only loading England), and also it took the Netherlands until 2586 to win their first World Cup.  </p>

<h2>I turned Millwall into the most aggressive team in the world - Part I</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Hurball </span><span class = "numcomments">148 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/e42qkj/i_turned_millwall_into_the_most_aggressive_team/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(863)">View full post</button><div id="863" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Whilst the vast majority of players dream of taking their team to the top of the league, to continental glory, or want to bring a minnow up through the leagues, my dream for Football Manager 2020 is a little bit different. I want to create the most aggressive, horrible, vile, unsporting team in the world. Success will be judged on fouls committed and on yellow and red cards. Points are of secondary importance to the project - though obviously I will have to get enough to keep my job. I want to kick my opponents off the park. Literally.</p>

<p>And the team for this? There&#39;s only one choice - Millwall.</p>

<p>(Well, there were other choices. Stoke and Leeds were obvious condenders, but I felt like Millwall fit the bill the best. I felt that this club would embrace my philosophy of bringing in unsporting thugs to hack at the opposition for 90 minutes every week)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>After a quick introduction the Millwall board demand I play pressing football and direct football. This suits all of us - the higher the pressing the more fouls we will commit. The board also want us to end up in mid-table. Nothing too demanding, and this will give me time to help mould this club into the vile place my philosophy demands.</p>

<p>One of the first points of call is to create a code of conduct. I don&#39;t want my players to worry about being carded, so remove every possible sanction for cards:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/x330j4mpnv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e62f95ab3e11e0e665f6ac50a5b2b1a861b02460">https://preview.redd.it/x330j4mpnv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e62f95ab3e11e0e665f6ac50a5b2b1a861b02460</a></p>

<p>The squad claim this is &quot;too lenient&quot;. I assertively tell them I won&#39;t be changing it. Morale is already low.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Key Attributes &amp; Traits</strong></p>

<p>Before doing anything I establish exactly what I want out of every player. The most important attributes are:</p>

<p><em>Aggression</em></p>

<p><em>Bravery</em></p>

<p><em>Work Rate</em></p>

<p><em>Determination</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, there are some player traits that will be instrumental in helping me achieve my aims:</p>

<p><em>Dives into tackles</em></p>

<p><em>Winds up opponents</em></p>

<p><em>Argues with officials</em></p>

<p><em>Gets crowd going</em></p>

<p>I will prioritise all players with these traits and attributes. My aim is to ideally have every player in the squad to have as many of these traits as possible.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Transfers</strong></p>

<p>I also set about overhauling the squad. I transfer list and loan list any players with low aggression (less than 12 for now, but I will re-evaluate this after the season - ideally I want everyone with a minimum of 18 aggression, but that utopia will have to wait). The squad feel my actions leave us lacking depth, and the fans are angry I&#39;ve loaned out the skillful Jed Wallace. His aggression was far too low. He was never going to make it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I dive into the transfer market. Key target Lee Cattermole has only just joined VVV-Venlo and refuses to talk to me. Arturo Vidal and Gary Medel are out of our league. Ashley Barnes, an icon of this shithouse football style we will be cultivating here, refuses to talk. Things look bleak.</p>

<p>Eventually we do some deals. Not the icons of shithousery we were after, but good, solid, horrible footballers like Sonny Bradley:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mj3qofbppv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c438c17b4ac62acda598726ecb16eab70e0196c1">https://preview.redd.it/mj3qofbppv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c438c17b4ac62acda598726ecb16eab70e0196c1</a></p>

<p>His bravery, aggression, determination, and work rate are exactly what we want. Plus, he likes to wind up opponents. We need more players like him. I also bring in a young French ball-winning midfielder (Ibrahim Karamoko), a young striker (Ryan Edmondson), a Reunionese left back (Kenji-Van Boto), all with high aggression and the potential to improve in the future. Finally, I bring in Darren Fletcher on a free transfer, primarily for his &quot;argues with officials&quot; trait.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong></p>

<p>Transfers aren&#39;t everything. For this to work I need everything at the club to push in the same direction. To this end I immediately set about training every single player at the club to &quot;dive into tackles&quot;. My coaches try to convince me otherwise, but I refuse to back down. Every player starts the individual training, from the U18s through to the first team. Those who cannot learn it will be sold.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/m7ubos8srv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12bb5046a1b37dd84a8c3fb5a4bb9af6619a8a41">https://preview.redd.it/m7ubos8srv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12bb5046a1b37dd84a8c3fb5a4bb9af6619a8a41</a></p>

<p>The other key traits won&#39;t be as simple. They cannot be learned through training, much to my dismay - only through mentoring. I promote the most promising youth players to the first team, and set up mentoring groups with the first team players who possess these godlike qualities. The likes of Alex Pearce (argues with officials), Darren Fletcher (argues with officials), and Shaun Hutchinson (winds up opponents), are assigned impressionable youngsters to tutor.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Tactics &amp; Pre-Season</strong></p>

<p>Pre-season is a mixed bag. To maximise the number of fouls committed I base my tactic on the high-pressing Gegenpress, with wing backs providing the width whilst a trio of ball-winning midfielders harass the opposition in the centre of the park. Fouling isn&#39;t simply a case of sitting back, you need to bring the fight to the opposition to maximise the fouls per minute.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/m3rqbc85tv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=29eb1ae389f363b0858e539fe2508d366e063b1f">https://preview.redd.it/m3rqbc85tv141.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=29eb1ae389f363b0858e539fe2508d366e063b1f</a></p>

<p>The first ever game of the new Millwall era is promising. 17 fouls and three yellow cards. It&#39;s a solid base to build on. Unfortunately we never reach these highs again. Away at Hapoel Rishon LeZion we only commit eight fouls and receive no cards whatsoever. We win the game, but the performance is unacceptable and I tell this to the players. Morale plummets. Our final pre-season game, at home to Zaragoza, ends in a 1-0 defeat, with zero cards.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There is much work to be done.</p>
