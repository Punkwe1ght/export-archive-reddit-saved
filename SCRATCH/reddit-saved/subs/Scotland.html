<button onclick="toggles(331)">View full post</button><div id="331" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I learned a few years ago that for some reason shortbread has a <em>reputation</em> with some people for being &quot;difficult&quot; to make, that it&#39;s really tricky and, mate, it&#39;s really not.  It&#39;s actually really simple - it&#39;s really only three ingredients.  Yes, <em>three</em>.  All you need to have when it comes to making this?  Is a gentle touch.  And yes, you can substitute the butter for vegan alternatives (so don&#39;t say I&#39;m not nice to you).  There are a <em>lot</em> of recipes out there that add vanilla to the biscuit and, well, just like with our Tory overlords, I&#39;d rather avoid that cuntwittery.  If you must be that useless and adulterate the biscuit, you can add a splash of vanilla <em>if you must</em> (but be warned, my grandfather - who made the <em>best</em> shortbread going - will come back from the grave and redo your paving.  Don&#39;t ask why.  It&#39;s just the thing my family think he would do to terrify someone from beyond the grave (next to planting tomato seedlings in your children&#39;s mouths and choking them, but that&#39;s only on special occasions)  We like to think that waking up to a completely redone patio or driveway would be bloody <em>terrifying.</em>  We all laughed at <em>Brookside</em> (my mum&#39;s cousin made copious notes, from what I&#39;m told.  No one&#39;s seen her ex-girlfriend since the 1990s...)</p>

<p><em>You&#39;ll need...</em></p>

<p><strong>500g of butter, softened.</strong></p>

<p><strong>175g of caster sugar.</strong></p>

<p><strong>600g of plain (all-purpose) flour, sieved.</strong></p>

<p>Now - if you want a crunchier biscuit you can take out 50g of that plain flour and substitute for 50g of semolina.  If you prefer it more melt-in-your-mouth-soft, you don&#39;t need to bother.</p>

<p><em>To make...</em></p>

<p>First, preheat your oven to 160 Celsius or 325 Wonky (or gas mark five).  Whilst the oven is getting it&#39;s groove on, beat together butter and sugar until nice and creamy, then beat in the flour (and semolina if you&#39;re using it), about 100g at a time, until nice and smooth.  If the dough becomes too stiff to stir, don&#39;t panic, mix the rest of the flour in with your hands.  </p>

<p>Now, lube, sorry, grease-up a large baking sheet (or a shortbread mould, if you&#39;re a posh cunt from Stockbridge).  Roll out the dough and press into the baking sheet (or mould)  Mark the dough into fingers <em>or</em> pie-shaped wedges (or if you&#39;re really desperate, you can cut the dough out into fancy wee shapes so you can feel all Mary-Berry even though <em>your</em> cooking skills are more Lucrezia Borgia) and prick all over with the prongs of a fork.  By the way - did you know that the proper term for the prongs on a fork is <em>tines</em>?  See - <em>educational</em>!  Don&#39;t you feel smarter already?!  No?  Huh.  Well, piss off then.</p>

<p>But before you do, make sure to bake the shortbread for around thirty to forty minutes, but keep an eye on it.  Shortbread has a reputation for catching.  It can be lovely and golden brown (texture like sun....) and then, whumphf, it&#39;s gone all early-2000s-Jordan on you.  You don&#39;t want that.  If you think it&#39;s starting to burn?  <em>Take it out</em>.  Now, some people like their shortbread dusted in caster sugar.  I&#39;m not one of those people.  I like my shortbread plain.  But, if you want?  Make sure to sprinkle on a <em>little</em> sugar as it cools. Remember - this stuff has <em>a lot</em> of sugar in it already.</p>
