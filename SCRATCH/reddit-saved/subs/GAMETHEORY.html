<h2>Learning Game Theory for Computational Social Science - Any Tips?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(84)">View full post</button><div id="84" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to get into Game Theory, especially with regard to computational social sciences. I would love to study Mechanism Design and Social Choice Theory. I am also excited to see the various ways in which the field of game theory influences computer science - Algorithmic Game Theory.  </p>

<p>Now that I have decided on doing a Master&#39;s in CS at NCSU (USA), I feel like I would never be able to take up these subjects formally because NCSU does not have these topics. Color me old-fashioned but I do not think I can study(or maybe I do not know how to ) by myself when it is topics that are not so related to my undergrad field(Information and Communication Tech). Is there a way to be able to learn Game Theory in a credible and provable way? I would love to work as a computational Social Scientist at Reddit someday(ambitious I know)  </p>

<p>As I come from a CS background - it is much easier to have a side code project that vouches for us knowing to work with the subject.<br/>
1. How can I set up a system like that, IF I choose to stick to online courses? Also, I have heard that academia does not really consider courses taken online of much value. I mean they are not completely wrong to think that because well people do cheat a lot. So I was wondering if maybe someone who had done a course and set up a small research project or side project. How did you go about doing this?  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to go explore topics in game theory pertaining to online communities and online social tendencies. I would love to touch on the topics of content moderation and product designs that have in place mechanisms/nudges for more humane tech. Are there any specific people that you know I could follow for more advice on the same?  </p></li>
<li><p>If doing online courses is the only way what would be a good choice for me? I&#39;ve done some digging and curated a small list of resources :<br/>

<p>I am definitely missing out on a lot of things. I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(290)">View full post</button><div id="290" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While it is true that the mathematical models for game theory tend to be much more efficient for solving dominant strategy matrices, I&#39;m not a math prodigy and would like to apply game theory to real-life situations for gaining the upper hand, whether they are business settings or social interactions. Some models that were researched were the &quot;Stackelberg model&quot; and the &quot;zero sum matrix.&quot; To survive in a cutt throat environment. If someone could link resources to such open courseware, that would be greatly appreciated. Please do not recommend 48 laws of power. Thank you.</p>
