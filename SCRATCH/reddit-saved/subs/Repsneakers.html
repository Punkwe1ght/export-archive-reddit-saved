<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So as we all know Ali is having its yearly 11/11 sale which includes some great deals, discounts, and coupon codes. I was thinking we can all grab our favorite dealers and make a nice list of people we have bought from.  Obviously Muks comes to mind but let&#39;s get a list rolling.  </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Well I never thought this would be such a popular question. But I will make a step by step guide on how to order from a rep site. <strong>Bolded steps are very important as they may help you not get screwed over just in case.</strong></p>

<p>Step 1. Choose your site. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Search the site for contact information. Do not place an order until you are in contact with them. </p>

<p>Step 3. Find shoe you want.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Ask the seller if it&#39;s in stock. If not see step 3.</p>

<p>Step 5. Before ordering make sure you ask for them to email you pictures of it before sending them out. Most do not have an issue doing this, especially with the competition nowadays.</p>

<p>Step 6. Add your item(s) to cart.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Quadruple check your information slowly. I don&#39;t care how much you think it&#39;s right. Check it again. They shouldn&#39;t have to suffer for your mistake of not putting in your info correctly.</p>

<p>Step 8. Place your order</p>

<p>Step 9. Contact site staff and tell them your order number. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m order number 0000000. Will you please send photos of item(s) to <a href="mailto:Sallysue879@gmail.com">Sallysue879@gmail.com</a> before shipping them?&quot;</p>

<p>Step 10. Check the pictures that should arrive in your email within the week. It takes 2 days for processing so do not grow impatient before at least 3 days.</p>

<p>Step 11-A. If item(s) meet your standards feel free to tell them they&#39;re good to ship.</p>

<p>Step 11-B. If item(s) do not meet your (hopefully reasonable) standards. Ask the seller to exchange for a better item(s). If exchange cannot happen you will be asked to choose an item(s) of equal or less value. Refunds take a long time and sellers are often unwilling to do so.</p>

<p>Step 12-B. See step 11-A</p>

<p>Step 13-B. See step 11-B. If compromise cannot be met, ask for refund. If refund cannot be met. Call your bank and explain what happened.</p>

<p>Step 12/14. Enjoy your item(s)</p>
