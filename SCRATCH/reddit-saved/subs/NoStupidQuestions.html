<div class="md"><p><strong><a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/e08ybj/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-even-better-than-the-real-thing">There was a Daily Show episode with John Oliver where they asked this question.</a></strong></p>

<p>John Oliver interviewed a bunch of people who remember those &quot;better times&quot; when &quot;America was great&quot;.  </p>

<p>First, he interviews an ad exec who created a Coca-Cola commercial during the 1970s.  He admits that it wasn&#39;t the greatest time.  1979 saw gas shortages.  John Oliver says that most people remember the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8">Mean Joe Greene commercial.</a></strong>  </p>

<p>Then, he talks a woman about how great the 1960s were... unless you were a woman or a minority.  It was a simpler time... of botched abortions and horrible rape policies.</p>

<p>He talks to a PR man about the 1950s - the threat of nuclear war and communists made it terrible.</p>

<p>Next, a black man explains that the segregated 1940s were not when America was great, either.</p>

<p>A very old woman discussing the 1930s says it wasn&#39;t the best era, either.  People were poor; she had to drop out of high school to make ends meet and the games they played were very simple and born out of having almost nothing.</p>

<p>So, when was the better, simpler time that political pundits and presidential candidates speak of?</p>

<p>John Oliver gathers up clips of Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O&#39;Reilly and sees a common thread in their nostalgia:</p>

<p><strong>When I was a kid...</strong></p>

<p>They were all CHILDREN!  </p>

<p>It was a better, simpler time when you were six years old.  It&#39;s less complicated and scary.  </p>
