<p>I think these recipes are unique in that they usually are truly easy to make and don&#39;t require very unique ingredients. They are also recipes that one can likely learn quickly.</p>

<p>Please link away! I want to increase my own &quot;regular&quot; set-list. :)  </p>

<button onclick="toggles(310)">View full post</button><div id="310" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a scientific researcher and I see recipes as protocols. When I need to follow a new protocol, I read it several times to make sense of it, compare it against other protocols, do some reading to understand the science behind it, make calculations and substitutions where needed, label all my receptacles, measure everything out, and then follow my protocol while taking notes and the times. I pretty much do the same for every relatively new/heavier-hitting recipe except labeling and taking notes while cooking (plenty before). It helps a lot to follow the process, especially comparing recipes and understanding why you do things. You fry certain sauces/pastes to extract the fat-soluble compounds, you mix gelatin/starches in cold water before adding to soups to prevent clumping -- general knowledge helps protect you against recipes that don&#39;t mention anything about it and screen out recipes that might not know what they&#39;re talking about. Granted, it&#39;s a lot of extra work but I find it so much more satisfying. Much less rush and more confidence, though the latter is not guaranteed, in both the lab and the kitchen. Still, making mistakes is also part of the process ðŸ˜€</p>

<h2>The wok butter-oyster sauce noodles + Maryland crab cakes = food gold</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(425)">View full post</button><div id="425" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tonight I was just planning to try the lo mien with lettuce, oyster sauce and butter for a simple dinner, but my neighbor dropped by with a dozen blue crabs he caught off his dock.  I figured â€˜what the heckâ€™, steamed the crabs in apple cider vinegar and beer (Natty Boh, naturally) picked them and made Gritzerâ€™s Maryland crab cake recipe, broiled.  I served the cakes on top of a pile of the noodles.  Both were awesome, but the combo was amazing.  It shouldnâ€™t be too surprising: the butter and oyster sauce already go well with crab, but the old bay and other cake flavorings also paired really well with the noodles too.  Just a bit of serendipity I wasnâ€™t expecting on a Monday night.  Thanks for listening</p>

<h2>What's the Chinese YouTube channel Kenji mentions that he likes watching? The one where it's entirely done in Mandarin lol</h2>

<p>He&#39;s also mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw">Chinese Cooking Demystified</a> (I&#39;ve been subscribed to them for a while and they&#39;re AWESOME! They&#39;re also active on Reddit!) during the same interview(s) IIRC. After Googling for a bit, could it be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQG_fzADCunBTV1KwjkfAQQ">Dianxi Xiaoge</a>? Their stuff seems rather....narrative-driven though. Maybe a nice change of pace from pure technique stuff for Kenji haha. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance, sorry this is just bugging me tonight and I&#39;m looking for new channels to watch. I rewatched/skimmed through his interview with Adam R., Kung Pao Chicken, etc. but no luck.</p>
