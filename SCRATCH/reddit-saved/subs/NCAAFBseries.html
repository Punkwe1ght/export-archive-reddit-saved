<li><p>This is a guide for those who already are familiar with the recruiting mini game in NCAA 14. For those of you that love recruiting as much as I do, here’s a complete guide to nabbing a sweet class. <em>It might be a little disorganized, but everything I put in is important!</em></p></li>
<li><p>First off, if you’re a 1 or 2 star school, don’t bother with the prospects that are interested in you unless you have lots of bonus points on them. Competition is the biggest problem for small schools. If you want to sign a top 10 class as UTEP or FAU, ignore those interested (unless they are immediate needs)  in you and look for higher caliber players with less competition. Prospects who are already interested in you are who the game expects you to get. And you can&#39;t turn around a fledgling 1 star program with one and two star recruits! Think <strong>BIGGER!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you’re at a 5 or 6 star prestige school, you shouldn’t need any help. This is a guide for getting the most out of a recruiting class with little to work with.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>KEY STRATEGIES</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Week 2 is vital!</strong> A commonly known strategy is to sort by % locked and find prospects that no one is recruiting. This is best done in week 2, as you’ll see if a prospect is being left alone or not. Skill position players are the most common (QB, HB, WR, ATH, DE) so you’ll probably have to look elsewhere for other positions. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Don’t be afraid to look at 2 star prospects</em>. <strong>Find JUCO players</strong> that are both 2 or 3 stars, and you have a mid to high 70’s player from the get go. But for players outside of JUCO&#39;s, don’t add prospects under 65 overall. There’s plenty of prospects to go around, and you won’t need them. There won’t be many gems that are worth finding who&#39;s predicted overall is less than 65. Just remember that a 65 overall player is an 80-85 overall player by the time he’s a redshirt senior, so don’t shy away from these recruits.</p></li>
<li><p>If you add a prospect to your board, you <strong>cannot</strong> put any points toward him until he lists your team on his interests. <strong>SO DON’T WASTE POINTS</strong>. If you have an N/A next to your school, don’t put points in, they do <strong>nothing</strong>. Because of this, offer scholarships week 2. <em>If you can’t use your points on a recruit, at least offer a scholarship</em>. If you go into a battle <strong>without</strong> a scholarship, you will sometimes <strong>fall down</strong> a players board no matter how many points you put in. </p></li>
<li><p>As for preseason, it&#39;s important too! If you follow the strategy above, you won&#39;t be able to actively recruit a player until week 3. For my preseason and week 1 recruiting board, often times I keep higher rated players or positions of need that are already interested. But the big thing I do is add &quot;usual suspect&quot; 5* players. There should be two or three 5* players that are ignored or are only recruited by small schools. These are often times Athletes, WR&#39;s, QB&#39;s, and HB&#39;s. I usually add all the 5* prospects of these positions and any others I have room for. That way, if you guess right and they are being lightly recruited, you get an extra 2 weeks of recruiting you wouldn&#39;t have gotten otherwise. And if you guess wrong, no harm no foul.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re at a small school, and Ohio State (or another big school) starts recruiting a player, drop him. You will waste points as you plummet down his board. Only recruit a player if you can give similar points per week as the competition. How do you know this? It’s easy math, but here’s how to recognize each scenario.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Calculate</strong> how many points you’re giving him: 500 points plus 30 bonus? That’s 530. Let’s say the competition’s bonus points (Viewable from the “Top Schools” tab on a recruit) is 230. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Scenario A</em>: You’re gaining 300 points per week on the competition: That means that the prospect is on another teams board, but they aren’t actively recruiting him, he’s only getting the bonus points from them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Scenario B</em>: You’re gaining 530 points per week on the competition:  They don’t even have him on their board. You’re free and clear! For now……</p></li>
<li><p><em>Scenario C</em>: You’re losing 200 points per week: That means the competition is actively putting 500 points per week (Plus 230 Bonus) into the prospect.  You should probably drop him as 200 points per week adds up quickly, and a visit can’t make up for that easily. As listed in an Operation Sports article, your competition will always put their max points into a prospect. Always. Unless they stop recruiting him completely. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Visits:</strong></p>

<p>Plan your visits ahead. Schedule a conference rival and that’s a free 300 bonus points for a win. There are visit boosts based on performance too, be sure to meet these. Also, If you’re confident in your abilities, visit versus a higher ranked team and earn up to 300 MORE points for a win (it’s incremental based on how much they are better than you). </p>

<ul>
<li>There seems to be a different cap on different positions for how many points they can receive from complementary visits, but no one can go higher than 300 (six 50 point boosts).*</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use your lock picks.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Lock picks are a free <strong>1500</strong> (on average) point boost. So you can strategically drop a prospect a bit right before a visit or before the offseason, as you can bombard them with points on top of the 1500 point boost. This takes some math and some finagling, so be prepared for that.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Finding the BIG TIME STEAL</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you hit week 7 or so, teams are going to start signing players left and right, so this is your chance to find a <strong>big steal</strong>. Look for prospects that are below 100% locked and only have one team in their projected cut off (1 team above the red dotted line), look at their top schools, and look to see if they have any scholarship offers. If they don’t, add them to your board. Now look at their top schools from your recruiting board, if all teams below the top team have green arrows with small gains, you’ve found yourself a steal. What happens, is that teams fill needs. If Florida has a 5 star OLB on their board and he commits, they will stop recruiting the 4 star OLB on their board. Even if the prospect is 80% locked and you’re 4000 points down, add him. He’s yours, <strong>pending</strong> you have little competition. I’ve never seen the CPU add a prospect back after removing him. Also, in online dynasties, no one does/knows this. It’s an easy way to get 1 or 2 big steals per class. Look every week for these prospects!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How many points does it take to land a recruit?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simply put, it’s different for every player, but you can crack it rather easily. It sort of depends on the caliber of the recruit, but the ONLY factor that has an influence on how many points it takes to land a recruit is his original locked %. The lower prospects generally have higher original locked %, so that’s why I said what I said earlier.</li>
</ul>

<p>But how many points <em>exactly</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As you can see, there is a gigantic difference between prospects. A player who starts at 20% locked takes <strong>over 2000 less points</strong> to commit than a player who starts at 14% locked. Take serious note of this.</p></li>
<li><p>These are the <em>most common</em> % locked for most 3, 4, and 5 star players. It keeps going down incrementally, with prospects that start with 25 or 26% locked, you only need <strong>35 points per 1% locked!</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>So what does all this mean?</em></p>

<p><em>How can you benefit from knowing this?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Well</em>, if you know the numbers, you can plan out when prospects are going to be ready to visit or commit. First off, you have <strong>ZERO</strong> influence on a prospect’s locked percentage if you are not in first place on his board. It will usually take 500-700 points to climb into first on a prospect’s board if they are being ignored by everyone else. Furthermore, you must put <strong>51</strong>% of total points into a prospect to net a visit. You must put in <strong>51</strong>% of points for a prospect to be ready to visit.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s make up some scenarios. Let’s use the chart above for numbers. Let’s also say you add two prospects that no one wants on week 2, when you can tell if they’re being left alone or not. </p>

</tbody></table>

<ul>
<li><p>You’re now down 550 points each on each prospect because you start at the bottom of their board. You want them both to come visit you when you play your rival week 8. That means:</p></li>
<li><p>You need 550 points plus 37% on the DT and 550 points plus 32% for the QB. Let’s play it safe and aim for 52%. You have 5 weeks to put in points until they must be ready for a visit. So you need to put in </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(550+(70*38))/ 5 weeks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>That’s roughly 640 points per week. Subtract the 110 bonus points you get, and you need to put in 530 points per week to have your DT ready for a week 8 visit.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the QB, </p>

<p><strong>(550+(51*33))/ 5 weeks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>That’s roughly 445 points per week. Subtract the 45 bonus points, and you get 400 points per week to be ready for a week 8 visit. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formula: ((Points out of first place)+(Points per % * Points until 52%) / Weeks</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>Fair warning though</em>, your bonus points can change every week. Check to see what the points are each week to get accurate readings, knowing the point total you need for a visit. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How many prospects should I realistically expect to net using this strategy?</strong></p>

<p><em>Let&#39;s look at the absolute bare minimum</em>. From the time you have to start recruiting these &quot;lonely&quot; prospects, at 5000 points available per week, you have 60,000 points (12 weeks) to work with. Let&#39;s say all your recruits start at 16% locked, and it takes 5000 points for them to commit. Let&#39;s say you have 500 points to gain first place with a prospect, a 700 point visit, and 100 bonus points per week. So, </p>

<ul>
<li><p>5000 + 500 - 700 - (100*12) = 3,600 spent recruiting points to commit</p></li>
<li><p>60,000 / 3,600 = <strong>16 or 17 commits per class</strong> (Not including off-season recruiting)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>For prospects without competition</em>, the earlier the visit the better. A 6 star program with an unexpected need can steal a prospect from 2000 points down in a matter of weeks, so plan accordingly. It’s  up to you how to divvy out your points, work a prospect too fast and lose out on others, spread yourself too thin and you will face the risk of easily losing prospects. If a 6 star school is gaining 500 points per week on you, Cut prospects quickly and put points elsewhere, even if you’re 1000 points ahead. When that prospect hits 100% locked, you must be 1300-1700 points ahead, or you’ll enter into a battle with a 6 star school that you will most likely lose.</p>

<p>For the Off-season, there really isn&#39;t any math. Sometimes a prospect will commit to you even if you only put in 50% of the points you need, sometimes he&#39;ll elect not to go to any school. Putting 2000+ points on a recruit seems like a safe bet, but still, the off-season by all accounts is pretty damn random and not predictable. Don&#39;t trust the off-season to make your class great. <strong>Make prospects commit before then</strong>.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all I know. If you want to see my data used to calculate the points per % point, let me know. Got anything else? Feel free to share!</p>
