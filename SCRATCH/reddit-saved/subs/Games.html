<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt releases this evening.  In order to prepare, either as a refresher course or a crash course if you haven&#39;t played the games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzLnfNSQRXnzVH56aR0Tig">Elder-Geek</a> put together a couple great videos that summarize the story of each game.</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqMr0OvQog"><strong>The Witcher</strong></a></h1>

<p><strong>TL;DW:</strong></p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Prologue - Kaer Morhen</strong> - Geralt of Rivia awakens, lost, with amnesia.  Fellow witchers bring you back to the witcher stronghold Kaer Morhen.  A group of bandits called the Salamandra attack the fortress, with two leaders, Azar Javed and the Professor, successfully stealing the mutagenic potions that genetically alter witchers to give them their abilities.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter I – Outskirts of Vizima</strong> - Geralt and his lover, the sorceress Triss Merigold, head to Vizima, the capital of Temeria, ruled by King Foltest, in search of info on the Salamandra.  On the outskirts he comes across a magically gifted child (aka: a &quot;source&quot;) named Alvin who prophecises the world being destroyed.  You also learn of an ongoing conflict between the Scoia&#39;tael (rogue elves) and the Order of the Flaming Rose, a military group tasked with protecting Temeria.  </p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter II – the Temple Quarter</strong> - Geralt continues to hunt the Salamandra, and once again comes across Azar Javed and the Professor, but they knock him unconscious and escape.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter III – the Trade Quarter</strong> - You eventually meet Princess Adda, one of Foltest&#39;s daughters.  When she was younger Geralt saved her from a curse that turned her into a monster.  You uncover evidence that she&#39;s now working with the Salamandra.  Geralt comes across Azar Javed and the Professor once again, and manages to kill the Professor.  After the battle Adda tries to have you arrested to hide her secret.  Triss teleports you away from the situation.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter IV – Lakeside</strong> - You take care of Alvin for a bit, and give him an amulet that helps him control his unpredictable powers.  The conflict between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia&#39;tael eventually make their way to your location across the lake from Vizima.  During a conflict, Alvin gets scared and teleports himself away, but is not seen again.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter V – Old Vizima</strong> - Civil war erupts between the Order and Scoia&#39;tael, with the local non-humans joining the Scoia&#39;tael.  King Foltest tells you Princess Adda&#39;s curse is back, and asks you to help.  After dealing with it (by either curing or killing Adda), King Foltest helps you locate Azar Javed.  You eventually kill him, but learn that the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques de Aldersberg, was working with the Salamandra.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Epilogue</strong> - During a fight with Jacques, he teleports you both into a possible future that resembles the destroyed world prophecised earlier.  Geralt learns that Jacques wanted the witcher mutagenic potions to create a race of super-human guardians to protect humanity from the potential destroyed future.  After defeating Jacques, you find that he has the same amulet that Geralt gave Alvin earlier, although it seems worn by age, hinting that when Alvin disappeared he teleported himself back in time and grew up to become Jacques de Aldersberg.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Ending Cutscene</strong> - Geralt stops an assassination attempt on King Foltest, and finds that the dead assassin is actually another witcher.</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSftIRQzYCM"><strong>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</strong></a></h1>

<p><strong>TL;DW:</strong></p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Prologue - Temeria</strong> - The game begins with Geralt in a Temerian prison for the assassination of King Foltest.  During an interrogation by Vernon Roche, the commander of the Blue Stripes (Temerian special forces), Geralt tells him that he witnessed Foltest&#39;s assassination at the hands of another witcher, who escaped with the help of the Scoia&#39;tael.  Roche believes you, and helps you escape with Triss Merigold to the river city of Flotsam.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter I - Flotsam</strong> - After arriving, Geralt, Triss, and Roche are attacked by Iorveth, the leader of the Scoia&#39;tael, but manage to escape.  Upon arriving, Geralt agrees to help kill a giant monster disrupting the town&#39;s trade routes.  With the help of the sorceress Sile de Tansarville, Geralt manages to kill the monster.  You learn the assassin, Letho, has turned against the Scoia&#39;tael and has kidnapped Triss.  At this point you can side with Iorveth or Roche, which drastically changes the next chapter.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter II (Iorveth) - Vergen</strong> - A battle breaks out between rebels and King Henselt of Kaedwen, and a curse is unleashed on the battlefield.  The group manages to escape to the city of Vergen with the rebels thanks to the sorceress Philippa Eilhart.  Philippa tells Geralt that Triss is being held by members of the kingdom of Nilfgaard who are working with Henselt.  Geralt heads to the Nilfgaard camp but is taken captive.  Roche helps Geralt, but the ambassador escapes with Triss.  Geralt manages to break the battlefield curse.  Henselt&#39;s army attacks Vergen, but is held off by Geralt, the Scoia&#39;tael, and the rebel leader Saskia, who is actually a dragon taking human form, and is currently under mind control by Philippa.  They all head to Loc Muinne for a summit of royal leaders. </p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter II (Roche) - Kaedwen Camp</strong> - A battle breaks out between rebels and King Henselt of Kaedwen, and a curse is unleashed on the battlefield.  The group manages to escape to the Kaedweni camp with Henselt where many in the camp are conspiring against Henselt because of his allegiance with Nilfgaard.  Geralt learns that Triss is being held by Nilfgaard, but they escape.  Geralt helps break the curse, which Henselt tells Geralt came from a witch he burned at the stake.  Geralt saves Henselt from 2 witcher assassins, and learns that both Sile de Tansarville and Philippa Eilhart are working with the assassins.  King Henselt kills Roche&#39;s Blue Stripes after learning that Roche helped spread the rumors about Henselt conspiring with Nilfgaard.  Henselt defeats the rebels, and you can allow Roche to either kill or spare King Henselt.  Geralt and Roche head to Loc Muinne to locate Sile, Philippa, and Letho.  </p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter III (Iorveth) - Loc Muinne</strong> - Geralt and Iorveth find Philippa imprisoned.  You can either go rescue Triss or help Philippa escape and she will give you a dagger than can break the mind control she put on Saskia.   During the meeting of leaders, it&#39;s revealed that Sile, Philippa, and the other mages put Saskia under mind control to use her dragon abilities so they re-establish the mage Conclave and hired Letho and the other assassins to kill the kings and weaken the countries.  After tracking Sile and learning that Letho has betrayed her, the dragon attacks, which you can kill, leave wounded (but still mind controlled), or use the dagger (if you got it) to break the mind control on Saskia.  </p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Chapter III (Roche) - Loc Muinne</strong> - Geralt and Roche learn that King Foltest&#39;s kids were kidnapped and one died in the process (no mention of Adda from the first game).  You can either go rescue Triss or Anais, Foltest&#39;s daughter.  Anais is then either returned to Temeria or given to King Radovid of Redania for protection.  After tracking Sile and learning that Letho has betrayed her, the dragon attacks, which you can kill or leave critically wounded (in Roche&#39;s path, you never learn the dragon is Saskia).</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Epilogue</strong> - If you chose to rescue Triss, the mage Conclave is re-established.  If you didn&#39;t, Letho blames the assassinations on the sorceresses and a witch hunt begins, and Triss gets rescued by Letho.  Letho tells Geralt that they used to be allies. He also reveals that all of this was a plot of the Nilfgaard Emperor to de-stabilize the region through assassinations, in preparation for an invasion, which Letho agreed to in return for his Witcher School to be rebuilt.  Geralt regains some of his lost memory, and remembers that he and his lover, the sorceress Yennefer, had nearly been killed long ago before being saved by Geralt&#39;s adopted daughter Ciri, who is a source, much like Alvin in the first game.  The Wild Hunt, a group of spectral wraiths, appeared and abducted Yennefer because they wanted her power, with Geralt and Letho in pursuit.  Geralt exchanged himself for Yennefer, leaving Letho to care for Yennefer.  Geralt later escaped The Wild Hunt and showed up near death with no memory, which is where the first game began.  Letho tells Geralt that Yennefer is now being held in Nilfgaard.</p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Ending Cutscene</strong> - Nilfgaard has begun their invasion into the north, moving quickly and destroying villages in their way.</p>

<h2>Blood Bowl 2: Legendary Edition - Launch Trailer</h2>

<button onclick="toggles('dml69s6')">View full post</button>
<div id="dml69s6" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>I love this game a ton. There are several questions I see every time it&#39;s mentioned outside of <a href="/r/bloodbowl">r/bloodbowl</a>, so I will try to offer up a good explanation of what Blood Bowl is, and whether it&#39;s something you might be interested in.</p>

<p><strong>What is Blood Bowl?</strong></p>

<p>Blood Bowl is a turn based strategy game, based around a parody of American Football, and taking place in a world that resembles (but is distinct from) the Warhammer Fantasy Old World setting. This means that you have a diverse cast of teams, ranging from the standard Humans and Orcs, to more out-there races like Nurgle (Warhammer Chaos god of disease), the Undead, and even a team of circus performers that leap around.</p>

<p>Originally released by Games Workshop as a tabletop game in 1986, the current edition of the rules dates back to 2009. The game <em>Blood Bowl 2</em> is a pretty faithful adaptation of this tabletop game, with only minor changes to team rosters.  Legendary Edition brings in 8 teams from the tabletop rules that, until now, were absent, (now the only missing team is Chaos Pact) as well as including the full roster of star players.  It also includes a couple of rules fixes to bring the game in line with tabletop (namely, being able to induce skilled mercs and have certain skills be optional).  In addition, the game includes a new, perpetual, single player mode, a “challenge” mode, a new stadium, two new sets of cheerleaders, and a ton of QoL fixes.</p>

<p><strong>How does it play?</strong></p>

<p>Despite its American Football trappings, it actually doesn&#39;t play that similarly to the real sport. To start, it&#39;s a turn-based game. There are two halves to each game, with 8 turns each. Each team can have up to 16 players, with only 11 being fielded at one time, and the rest being put into reserves. On your turn, you&#39;ll block your opponent&#39;s pieces, trying to push them around or knock them down and potentially injure them to get them off the pitch, and if you&#39;re on offense, you will try to move the ball, with your ultimate goal being to get the ball to the end-zone for a touchdown, while if you&#39;re on defense you&#39;ll be trying to stop your opponent from scoring, and maybe even try to steal the ball and score yourself. Additionally, as you play games, you will accumulate money to buy more players/support staff, and your existing players will gain experience (SPP, aka Star Player Points) which allows them to level up and learn new skills, though they can also become injured, or even die.</p>

<p><strong>Football with Orcs, Elves, and Dwarves? That sounds great, sign me up!</strong></p>

<p>Now hang on there cowboy. Before you drop the dosh on the shiny new Legendary Edition, there&#39;s a couple things you should know. First, Blood Bowl is a dice game. Those blocks you throw? Depending on the strength of the players involved, you&#39;ll be throwing between one to three dice and choosing a result (or possibly having your opponent choose). Picking up the ball? Roll a die. Dodging away from a scary opponent? Make a roll. Worse still, these dice are only 6 sided, and a 1 is always a failure, while a 6 is always a success. That means that, at best, most actions only have about an 83% chance of success. Now there are some mitigating circumstances, with the ability to re-roll some tests, among other things you can do, but the game can be cruel with probabilities. If you&#39;re the type of person that gets upset when missing a 90% shot in X-com, maybe consider staying away.</p>

<p>Additionally, the game is really tough for newcomers. While the basic rules aren&#39;t too hard to grasp, there&#39;s a ton of strategic elements that are really non-obvious. Most damning however, is that it&#39;s really hard for a new player to tell whether they are being outplayed by a superior opponent, or if they just have shitty luck. The reason for this is that a good opponent will try to force you to roll as many dice as possible, since the more dice you roll, the greater chance of failure you have, and failing a roll is extremely punishing. For most rolls, if you fail, then your turn <em>immediately</em> ends, and play passes back to your opponent.  While you can enjoy Blood Bowl as a ridiculous beer-and-pretzels game, if you plan to take it even remotely serious, you’ll have to commit a good bit of time just to achieve baseline competence.</p>

<p><strong>Wow, that sounds awful. Why would anyone play this?</strong></p>

<p>Because despite the inherent variance of the game, you have the tools to manage it to an acceptable extent, to the point that over the course of a league (more on that later) the best player is almost certainly going to come out on top. Additionally, the progression system is hugely compelling. Like X-com, you can easily get invested in your players, and seeing them rank up to Legend rank, is as wonderful as watching that same player die because a member of the crowd threw a rock at them is devastating. Story lines naturally emerge, as players become great, then inevitably die. It takes a certain mindset to appreciate, but there&#39;s just something hilarious about the over-the-top nature of things; in a single play, you could hand the ball off to a Goblin, have your Troll throw the Goblin, who then lands on their feet, and scampers off into the end-zone, weaving through opponents along the way...or the Troll could just eat your Goblin instead.</p>

<p><strong>Alright, you&#39;ve sold me. How do I start?</strong></p>

<p>Well, first I would start by playing the campaign, which acts as a kind of an extended tutorial. While the in-game tutorial does a good job teaching the basic mechanics, it doesn&#39;t really teach the additional strategic elements you should know. For this, there are several good resources: for videos, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4afR3gulUM">Jimmy Fantastic&#39;s Intro Game</a> and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJ6kwwJv4Nr-Ky1PaFZys50S7zewio1O">cKnoor&#39;s Beginner Guide to Blood Bowl</a>. This second one uses Blood Bowl 1 footage, but the rules and principles are the same as Blood Bowl 2, so it&#39;s still a good resource.</p>

<p>If text guides are more your speed, then I recommend FUMBBL&#39;s <a href="https://fumbbl.com/help:The+Taoch%21+of+Blood+Bowl%3A+A+Condensed+Guide+for+Newbies">Strategy Guide for Newbies</a>. If you&#39;re looking to take your game to the next level, then I highly recommend both <a href="http://www.thenaf.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The-Art-Of-Blocking.pdf">The Art of Blocking</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ednwzorq89gc4g/1000%20Losses%20Ed1.pdf">The Thousand Losses Playbook</a></p>

<p><strong>What race should I start with?</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day, you should choose whichever one most interests you. That said, there are several races that are better for new players, either due to lots of starting skills to help mitigate bad luck, high armor to prevent injuries, or a combination of both. The best team for new players is probably Orcs, as they have good starting skills, high strength to help with blocking, and high armor to avoid being injured and outnumbered. Other good teams for new players are: Amazons, Humans, Dark Elves, and Undead. Teams to avoid are: Goblins, Halflings, Ogres, Vampires, and Khemri. These teams can perform well in the hands of a skilled coach, but they play very differently than normal teams, and are more likely to frustrate a new coach than entertain them.</p>

<p>Once you decide on a team, FUMBBL&#39;s <a href="https://fumbbl.com/help:LRB6RaceStrategy">Racial Strategies and Rosters</a> and <a href="https://bbtactics.com/">BBTactics</a> have a wealth of information on good starting rosters, play strategy, and level up advice.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the best way to play?</strong></p>

<p>The game has single-player, and it&#39;s fine, but the real meat is in the multiplayer. The default multiplayer league is the “Cabalvision Open League” which functions as a traditional, perpetual, matchmaking league, where you queue up for a game, and get automatically matched with a coach of roughly your same skill level, playing a team of roughly your same Team Value. There is also “Cabalvision Champion Ladder” which is a matchmaking league that has “seasons” where at the end of every season, the top team of each race is invited to a playoff, and the winner receives cash prizes. This league also is a bit more policed, and concessions are penalized, so while the overall skill of the coaches is a bit better than the Open League, the quality of games are usually a bit better too.</p>

<p>My preferred way to play however, is in a scheduled league. A scheduled league emulates a traditional sports season, where you play a certain number of games over a given time-frame (usually about 1 per week) and if you do well enough, you can compete for a championship. One of the largest leagues on PC is actually the Reddit Eternal League, <a href="/r/rebbl">r/rebbl</a>, with a couple hundred coaches, split into European, American, and Oceanic timezones. REBBL also has a sister league, <a href="/r/rebbrl">r/rebbrl</a>, which exists specifically to help new players learn the game. If you find you like the game, I would highly recommend joining this league to be part of a really nice community, that will help you to get the most out of this wonderful game. They are currently recruiting for the next season until September 20th, and can usually accommodate a few late sign-ups as well. REBBRL also maintains their own “spin league” that functions similarly to the Open League if you don&#39;t want to commit to a scheduled league.</p>

<p>As I said at the start, I love this game. If you have more questions, I&#39;ll do my best to answer them as best I can, though I&#39;m currently at work so there might be a bit of delay. The game certainly isn&#39;t for everyone, but I think there&#39;s just something magical about it, and no other game delivers a similar experience, in my opinion. If anything I&#39;ve said above interests you, I encourage you to pick it up, and give it a whirl.</p>

<h2>Just a few things unnoticed from Death Stranding trailers</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>EDIT: Heres the meaning of trailer 1 and 2 in a simple and quick explanation: <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/TfXTkP1">https://m.imgur.com/a/TfXTkP1</a> when you analyze trailer 3 and 4 you get even more confirmations that this is the plot, but I&#39;ll postpone the explanation/hidden things of those for another day.</p>

<p>This one is pretty obvious: people with Orange suits are part of a &quot;Corpse Disposal Team&quot;. There&#39;s a &quot;CDT&quot; badge on every guy with orange suits that shows up at the trailers.</p>

<ol>
<li>First and second trailers feature a lot of crabs dead at the start, that&#39;s pretty blatant. Crabs cast off their shells for new ones, so they are associated with rebirth/cycling of life. That&#39;s a strong hint at the last trailer rebirth quote, &quot;You&#39;ll come back, sure, but the area around you will still be a crater...&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a7X20gfNGc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a7X20gfNGc</a> (kinda gross)</li>
<li>Connecting 1 to 2, people need to dispose of old corpses (shells) from past &quot;lives&quot;. No idea why.</li>
<li>Sam keeps count of how many times he died by marking dots at his right hand. At trailer 1 he has 1 dot at his right hand, trailer 4 he has 4 dots. The fact that he keeps count probably means that after a set number of deaths, something changes (see what I say about madds later)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t remember which trailer, but one of those at the &quot;Directed by Hideo Kojima&quot; (or so) part you can see the black goo dripping from some letters. Take note of the sequence that the goo starts dripping from the letters and you get the word &quot;Jaam-e&quot;. &quot;Jaam-e (jam)&quot; is a mythological cup of immortality from persian culture. Fits a lot to the game theme. I&#39;ll take a nap and then edit here with the exact trailer and timestamp, I noticed this a few days ago and noted on my phone.</li>
<li>Same thing as 5, you get the words &quot;Dydob&quot; which I can only interpret as &quot;Body&quot;. Not sure what it means tho.</li>
<li>The names of the people in the game follow the: &quot;Name City State&quot; or &quot;Name Job State&quot; pattern. Sam, from Porter, Bridges; some people said it means Sam, a transPorter from Bridges, but I find it redundant because of 8.</li>
<li>Orange suit = CDT, Gray suit = Transporter, Blue suit = Soldier of some sort.</li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s also a few hints as to what exactly the madds mikkelsen character is and what are his motivations, but I&#39;m kinda tired rn. To summarize: my logic is that he is part of a &quot;faction&quot; that has embraced the immortality shitshow and probably skeleton soldiers are what happens after A: you die and come back a lot of times or B: you stay alive for enough time for your body to decompose, maybe it has something to do with the rain too. Sam&#39;s faction is trying to &quot;unstrand&quot; death - as in, get mortality back to normal, that is hinted at the trailer where there&#39;s talk about explosions and at the end he says &quot;And the last explosion... will be our last&quot; just to say &quot;Awww yeah&quot; like a &quot;last explosion&quot; is a positive thing.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure about the lore around the cities and why transporters are so important for the lore. Btw: people live in underground cities. I can explain all of that later if you guys take interest.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have a steam link and it&#39;s as smooth as butter. Make sure you use Hardware Encoding. Make sure you use automatic bandwidth, it might seem like you should set it to &quot;unlimited&quot; but it induces latency, let Steam decide. Make sure you use a wired set up or have a good Wifi set up with little interference.</p>

<p>Use performance monitoring to see where the problem is. I tried the Steam link app on my Android TV and there was a lot of dropped frames since the TV hardware wasn&#39;t particularly great. On the Steam link box though it&#39;s fine. Check to see whether you get dropped frames or dropped packets or whether it&#39;s streaming at 60 FPS at all, maybe it&#39;s a PC issue. </p>

<h2>Obscure Indie Game Recommendations for the Steam Summer Sale 2023</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/carnaxcce </span><span class = "numcomments">65 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/14mxgy0/obscure_indie_game_recommendations_for_the_steam/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(1)">View full post</button><div id="1" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I play a bunch of indie games, obscure and otherwise, and every 6 months or so I like to do a big recommendation post to coincide with a Steam sale. Not all of these are on sale, not all of them are obscure, and I think a couple might not qualify as indie games? But I liked them all and would highly recommend them!</p>

<h1>Early Access Update</h1>

<ul>
<li>Since I last recommended <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/">Spin Rhythm XD</a> it has left early access! Spin Rhythm is by far my favorite rhythm game of recent years-- great soundtrack, great innovative control scheme, great visual polish and accessibility options. Highly recommend playing with a DJ wheel if you get a chance, it&#39;s such a blast!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Obscure (&lt;100 reviews)</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960890/Jishogi/">Jishogi</a> is a visual novel combined with a collection of interesting Chess and Shogi themed puzzles. The writing is disarmingly compelling-- I didn&#39;t quite finish it, but the big swings the story takes have been stuck in my brain ever since I played it. It&#39;s on my shortlist of games to revisit and complete.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964330/Madcap_Mosaic/">Madcap Mosaic</a> has big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/557410/Dream_Quest/">Dream Quest</a> vibes. It&#39;s a completely novel take on the roguelike deckbuilder genre and despite its somewhat rough presentation is crammed absolutely full of cool ideas. Worth a go in its own right (there&#39;s a demo!), but I&#39;m also looking forward to whatever this one&#39;s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay the Spire</a> will be.</li>
<li>Continuing the esteemed line of Minesweeper-type puzzle games (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/50074/?snr=1_5_9__403">Hexcells</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/709920/Tametsi/">Tametsi</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865060/14_Minesweeper_Variants/">14 Minesweeper Variants</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892790/Polimines/">Polimines</a>) is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262930/Bombe/">Bombe</a>. Instead of just solving minesweeper puzzles, you program logical deductions to general minesweeper problems and have the game solve them for you. The UI is a little rough, but it&#39;s such a surprisingly compelling puzzle and a really unique take on this well-trod genre.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1747510/An_Architects_Adventure/">An Architect&#39;s Adventure</a> is a very rigorous exploration of a simple set of block-pushing puzzle mechanics. Super chill experience and a sizable collection of high quality puzzles.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459540/Elephantasy/">Elephantasy</a> is a cute little spin on a metroidvania. You have access to all of your traversal items at the beginning of the game, but can only equip one at a time. As you solve puzzles with those you unlock the ability to equip two and access to harder puzzles and so on. Lots of secrets to find, lots of goodies to collect, and finishable in just a few hours. It also has an isometric 3D sequel in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2284310/Elephantasy_Flipside/">Elephantasy: Flipside</a>, which is much bigger and much weirder but still worth a go if you like the first one.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814170/Lingo/">Lingo</a> is like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/">The Witness</a> if it had word puzzles instead of line puzzles and was set in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/">Antichamber</a> complex. It has some of my favorite word puzzles I&#39;ve ever solved, and there are tons of great community-made maps out there if you like the base game.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2222200/Springblades/">Springblades</a> is a perfect little distillation of a small numbers JRPG. Many many pieces of gear that have tons of abilities and lots of interesting little synergies.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Kind of Obscure (&lt;1,000 reviews)</h1>

<ul>
<li>If you had asked me whether I wanted to play a 3D first person <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/">Getting Over It</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/">Jump King</a>-alike, I would&#39;ve said that sounds like the worst idea imaginable. But despite that, I gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330500/BETON_BRUTAL/">Beton Brutal</a> a go and I&#39;m <em>so</em> glad I did. Both because it&#39;s got extremely satisfying and smooth movement and, unlike the aforementioned games, doesn&#39;t have an ounce of cruelty or condescension. Just ambient noises, a nice soundtrack, and good slightly spooky vibes. Plus it gives you a great suite of tools to help you succeed, including a Scout mode that lets you fly around your immediate area and scope stuff out. Highly recommend!</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/961660/Nowhere_Patrol/">Nowhere Patrol</a> is a great little indie Cuphead-like. I knew this game would be special when I finished the first boss without taking damage and was treated to a special perfect-run-only extra-hard final phase. Extremely generous game with great visuals and tight gameplay.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295320/Can_of_Wormholes/">Can of Wormholes</a> is a sokoban-ish puzzle game where you gradually discover new rules and interactions with the very strange set of objects you are given to play with. Think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/">Stephen&#39;s Sausage Roll</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1052990/A_Monsters_Expedition/">A Monster&#39;s Expedition</a>. No game has ever had as many jaw dropping mechanical epiphanies as this one does, cannot recommend it enough.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Not obscure in the slightest (&gt;1,000 reviews)</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/">Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</a> is one of the most peculiar games I&#39;ve ever played. It&#39;s a side scroller action RPG stapled to a highly detailed rice farming simulation. Instead of leveling up your character via combat, your stats and abilities are directly tied to the quality of the rice you grow. The combat has multiple fun gimmicks (a very satisfying grappling hook, physics-based combat that encourages flinging enemies into each other) and the farming sim is bafflingly detailed. If you vibe with both halves of the game, there&#39;s nothing out there like it.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811990/Wildfrost/">Wildfrost</a> is a highly polished TRPG roguelike deckbuilder. It got a bit of a reputation on launch of being unfairly difficult (a criticism I wholly disagree with) but the devs have been consistently putting out updates with more content, more difficulty options, and more quality of life features. I&#39;m usually not a fan of tactics games, but this one strikes a perfect balance between simplicity (with a max of six units per side) and difficulty (the position of those six units is absolutely crucial and often not obvious). Plus the art, music, and graphic design are all absolutely top notch.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/">Card Shark</a> has you learning, practicing, and executing card cheats in order to rob 18th-century noblemen blind (and maybe stage a revolution in the process?). It&#39;s basically a collection of tiny card-themed minigames wrapped in a historical political thriller, but boy does it do a good job of dialing up the tension when you need to get a card trick absolutely right or get killed (or worse). I&#39;d probably call this one the most novel game on the whole list.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Basically Mainstream (&gt;10,000 reviews)</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/">Brotato</a> is, despite its appearance, far and away my favorite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a>-like. I&#39;m a huge fan of roguelites that give you tiny actionable goals that reward you with new gameplay tools (and, even better, more goals associated with them) and Brotato has those  in spades: most achievements unlock new characters, each with their own game-changing gimmick and reward for finishing a run. And there are dozens of characters! It just left early access about a week ago and is crammed full of content.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/">Dave the Diver</a> just left early access yesterday and is a really unique beast. It starts as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/">Subnautica</a> meets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/">Moonlighter</a> but just keeps piling on more (and more aND MORE) mechanics, systems, and interactions. If you dig the core gameplay loop, this game has an astounding amount of content to dig into.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Octopath Traveller II - Demo Trailer</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(242)">View full post</button><div id="242" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Regarding of how Square&#39;s in-house studios are organized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix">you can take a look at their Wikipedia-page on their development organizations with their Creative Business Units</a> and see their general directions; Creative Business Unit I for instance consists of the general staff with FFVII: Remake and Kingdom Hearts, Creative Business Unit III with MMORPGs and FFXVI with history of staff from Ivalice-games, e.t.c.</p>

<p>For the specific HD-2D-aesthetics, it was something that was pioneered with <em>Octopath Traveler</em> by studio Acquire that Square Enix was co-developing the game with, and which they requested Acquire a way to have 2D pixel-sprites engaging in a 3D-environment in an attempt to modernize the pixel-aesthetics. <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">There&#39;s an article by Epic&#39;s Unreal Engine that details it further the process involved</a>, and details of how the artstyle turned out to be quite flexible once cemented with the toolset of Unreal Engine 4, remarking of how <em>Octopath Traveler</em> had a relatively small development team. The success from it have lead that every game with the HD-2D look having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoya_Asano">Square Enix-producer Tomoya Asano</a> being the one seemingly overheading it (He and his team is nick-named as &quot;Team Asano&quot; within Square.) (Asano was one of the producer along with Masashi Takahashi from Square that worked on <em>Octopath Traveler</em>.) Asano and his team is in turn categorized within Square&#39;s Creative Business Unit II that also is the development department that also handles the <em>Dragon Quest</em>-franchise, which could explain why DQIII is the next one involved in the HD-2D treatment.</p>

<p>So it is from seemingly one specific art team within Acquire, but under direction by Square which has lead to it being distributed to other studios that Square (under producer Tomoya Asano), can co-develop with for other genres and systems involved (The <em>Live-A-Live</em>-remake, while having many original creative leads returning for the remake, also was co-developed with studio Historia. <em>Triangle Strategy</em> was co-developed with studio Artdink.).</p>

<button onclick="toggles(308)">View full post</button><div id="308" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>If you like deckbuilding games, I recommend Mystic Vale. It&#39;s a mobile version of the board game of the same name. The app costs $3.50 for the base game, and there are expansions that add additional cards/mechanics which you can buy separately for a few dollars each in the app. There are no ads or any other monetization whatsoever. The game includes multiple tutorials to teach you how to play. It has online multiplayer which uses a lobby system (no matchmaking), letting you create/join public or private lobbies of up to 4 players. The app even supports playing multiplayer in person from a single phone by passing the phone around between players. There also varying levels of AI you can play against offline if you prefer, and your offline games can be saved at any time to be resumed at your leisure. The game has achievements as well (on Android, not sure about other platforms).</p>

<button onclick="toggles(309)">View full post</button><div id="309" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Some I’ve enjoyed on my iPhone recently:</p>

<p>Void Tyrant - This one is a deckbuilding roguelite where the combat is blackjack. Very fun, although it is a bit shallow. </p>

<p>Solitairica - Another card-based roguelite, this one has you playing solitaire to progress through a series of enemies. </p>

<p>Dungeon and Puzzles - Fun Sokoban-esque puzzle game. </p>

<p>Gloomgrave - First-person rogue-style dungeon crawler. </p>

<p>Grimvalor - Action side-scroller with light Souls elements. </p>

<p>Hot Lap League - Trackmania clone</p>

<p>Iron Marines - Really great series of RTS games. </p>

<p>Monster Train - Another deckbuilding roguelite, though this one is a lot more popular as it was on PC and consoles prior. One of my favorite roguelites, period. </p>

<p>Polytopia - This one is a classic, it’s a bite-sized 4X game that goes for thirty turns. You can lose hours in this one. </p>

<p>1-Bit Rogue - Minimalist roguelike with simple one-handed controls. </p>

<p>I also recommend anything by Kairosoft, and if you have Netflix or Apple Arcade you have a lot more great options to choose from as well.</p>

<h2>Games with an abundance of good user-created content</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(340)">View full post</button><div id="340" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the past year or two, I’ve gotten back in touch with my love of old-school first person shooter games. In particular, I’ve gotten pretty obsessed with Doom and Doom 2, largely due to the incredibly vast selection of fan-made levels, modifications, and all sorts of other custom content. There are easily dozens of game length conversions that I would put head and shoulders above either of the original campaigns.</p>

<p>This got me wondering what other games and fan bases have similarly vast bodies of work I’m simply unaware of. I’m relatively new to PC gaming, being a lifelong console gamer primarily, so most of my experience with mods has been old Super Nintendo rom hacks and the like. I’ve dabbled a bit in custom campaigns for age of empires back in the day. Otherwise it’s all pretty much new to me. </p>

<p>So, any games that have an endless amount of quality custom content you want to shout out? Any mods or conversions that don’t get the attention they deserve simply because they released as mods rather than standalone games? Any game, any genre, anything’s fine.</p>

<p>(To get the ball rolling, and since I mentioned my love of Doom 2 mods, anyone with any love for arena shooters should try out Ancient Aliens or Back to Saturn X, either of which I’d count among my all-time favorite FPS campaigns, and there’s plenty more beyond those.)</p>

I&#39;m the developer making <strong>Spellbook Demonslayers</strong> and I&#39;m excited to share the newest version of the game with all of you!</p>

<p><strong>Game:</strong> Spellbook Demonslayers</p>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action Roguelite</p>

<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC (Steam), hopefully mobile soon!</p>

<p><strong>Steam Page:</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007530/Spellbook_Demonslayers/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007530/Spellbook_Demonslayers/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved the massive power scaling and buff stacking possible in the endgame of Path of Exile, and I was inspired by the really fun and accessible style of Vampire Survivors to combine the two in Spellbook Demonslayers! You start each run with just your chosen spell and passive, and quickly gain huge amounts of power with each level up to slay thousands of demons.</p>

<p>The newest update (voted for by the community!) adds new branching upgrade options for you to choose from each run to customize your build, letting you make even more overpowered combos than before! More community-requested features and changes are being worked on for next week&#39;s update.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love for you to try the game out, It&#39;s available now for $2.99: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007530/Spellbook_Demonslayers/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007530/Spellbook_Demonslayers/</a></p>

For folks out of the loop, this is a regular event where indie devs upload their demos for a one week showcase.  The event ends on Monday, October 10, so I think it’s a great chance to share your favorite demo you tried this week and for others to try it.</p>

<p>I’ll share one: Ships of Fools.  It’s a co-op rouge like similar to a mix of Sea of Thieves and Overcooked.  Played it 2 player and had a great time: visuals were clean and fun, controls felt responsive, and it felt like just the right amount of hectic and manageable. </p>

<p>How about you?</p>

<button onclick="toggles(457)">View full post</button><div id="457" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Of the 2022 releases I&#39;ve played (and some of them I&#39;ve only played solo or only once so take it with a grain of salt), I&#39;d say they are... </p>

<ul>
<li>Return to Dark Tower</li>
<li>Long Shot: The Dice Game</li>
<li>Bullet⭐</li>
<li>Blood on the Clocktower</li>
<li>Burncycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Not really in any order and I haven&#39;t played many more that were actually released in 2022.   None of these are in my top 10 yet since I haven&#39;t played them enough.   I am likely to play Burncycle/Long Shot the most just because I own them.   Return to Dark Tower I&#39;ll likely reserve to play with others.  Bullet I don&#39;t own but will likely pick it up at some point.   </p>

<p>There are also a lot of games that still to release, and some games I am not even 100% if they are 2021 games or 2022 games (like Aeons End Legacy of Gravehold or Ark Nova).  </p>

<p>Games I am either still looking forward to playing or are notable (for me)</p>

<ul>
<li>Libertalia got a rerelease and I own the original and it&#39;s a fun game (with flaws) but unique to what it does</li>
<li>Lord of the Rings the Card game is getting a Revised core set (it might be out already?)</li>
<li>Townsfolk Tussle I want to play but haven&#39;t yet</li>
<li>Paint the Roses - I am a huge fan of deduction games and would love to try this but I don&#39;t own it nor know anyone who does but will likely track this down at some point</li>
<li>Frosthaven - Sequel to Gloomhaven, can&#39;t wait!</li>
<li>Now or Never - I have enjoyed all of Ryan Laukats games so far, even if they are flawed in some gameplay ways, they are always a fun experience with the right people</li>
<li>Bargain Basement Bathysphere - this is a free print and play getting a boxed release, I&#39;ve played the PNP and it was good, just thought it was notable.</li>
<li>Marvel Dice Throne just was delivered but I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to get it to the table</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of bigger games that I will likely not buy would gladly play (like Oathsworn or Kingdom Death stuff) and probably a ton of other games that I simply won&#39;t experience that could easily make it onto someone elses list.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(496)">View full post</button><div id="496" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: Since Reddit is killing third party apps, I decided to make my own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44311783-Obscure-Indie-Recommendations/">Steam Curator Page</a>. Please follow it if you&#39;ve enjoyed these posts over the last couple years!</p>

<p>I play a ton of obscure indie games, and a bunch of my favorites are currently on sale. I don&#39;t think these games get the attention they deserve and they&#39;re all worth your time, so take a look if any of them catch your interest!</p>

<p>Everything from my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/r2ut1j/obscure_indie_game_recommendations_for_the_steam/">previous list</a> is still on sale and I still highly recommend everything on it, especially the two early access games (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/">Spin Rhythm XD</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/">Scarlet Hollow</a>) that have received more content in the last 6 months. </p>

<p>And here are some of the great games I&#39;ve played in the last 6 months that are on sale:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522870/Supraland_Six_Inches_Under/">Supraland Six Inches Under</a> is an incredible iteration on the original Supraland. Better puzzles, better world design, cool new powers, <em>much</em> improved combat/puzzle balance.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046400/Astalon_Tears_of_the_Earth/">Astalon: Tears of the Earth</a> is a great retro styled Metroidvania. Control a party of heroes each with different strengths, weaknesses, and traversal abilities through a huge tower full of secrets. Feels kind of like a cool iteration on a roguelike, since every time you die you respawn at the base of the tower and you make progress by unlocking fast travel points.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/790060/The_Void_Rains_Upon_Her_Heart/">The Void Rains Upon Her Heart</a> is an astounding indie sidescrolling boss rush roguelike shmup. An absolutely staggering amount of content from dozens of bosses, four distinct and individually compelling gameplay modes, and a really singular aesthetic and writing style. It&#39;s still in early access and gets updates every two weeks, the last couple of updates have really fleshed out the story mode with more random events.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184820/Poker_Quest/">Poker Quest</a> is a super crunchy spin on the roguelike deckbuilder. All of the combat is handled through drawing cards from a standard 52 card deck and using them to activate items. I&#39;m constantly astounded at both the depth of the gameplay decisions (there&#39;s both a great roguelike deckbuilder-esque build crafting and combat system <em>and</em> a really complex and difficult resource management game here, and they&#39;re both really tightly intertwined). I have about 20 hours in it and have never even ventured past the first of 5 bosses, I&#39;ve just had a blast playing with all of the different characters (there are tons!</li>
</ul>

<p>And since I&#39;ve played <em>a ton</em> of puzzle games recently, here&#39;s a puzzle game lightning round. I highly recommend all of these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1463920/hexceed/">hexceed</a> is Hexcells but with a practically infinite amount of easy but huge puzzles.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693260/Yugo_Puzzle/">Yugo Puzzle</a> is the latest from the guy who made Jelly no Puzzle</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1052990/A_Monsters_Expedition/">A Monster&#39;s Expedition</a> is the coziest puzzle game, nay the coziest <em>game</em> I have ever played. Recently received a really excellent update that adds hints to every puzzle that don&#39;t trivialize the puzzles themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706090/Bean_and_Nothingness/">Bean and Nothingness</a> has all the looks of a super difficult top-down Sokoban like, but you don&#39;t actually push any blocks around?? Really novel mechanics</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/">Patrick&#39;s Parabox</a> Absolutely joyous showcase of Sokoban-based recursion</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147890/Bonfire_Peaks/">Bonfire Peaks</a> is a more accessible spin on Stephen&#39;s Sausage Roll</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1492620/Jelly_Is_Sticky/">Jelly is Sticky</a> is Sokoban, but you&#39;re sticky jelly</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1923790/Linelith/">Linelith</a> is The Witness, but tiny</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892790/Polimines/">Polimines</a> is Picross, but also Minesweeper.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s it from me! Any other under-the-radar indies people would recommend checking out?</p>

<h2>Steam Next Fest June 2022 - One Week Later Impressions Thread - What have you played?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/freddyfro </span><span class = "numcomments">280 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/vf7nkj/steam_next_fest_june_2022_one_week_later/" target="_blank">(source)</a>

For folks out of the loop, this is a regular event where indie devs upload their demos for a one week showcase.  The event ends on June 20, so I think it’s a great chance to share your favorite demo you tried this week and for others to try it.</p>

<p>I’ll share one: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1813860/NAIAD/">NAIAD</a>.  This was revealed during one of the “E3” showcases and immediately caught my eye.  It’s a slower, relaxing journey through beautiful art where you control a “water spirit.”  In it, you use your swimming and song powers to restore nature back to life, unite a baby duck back with its mom, and more.  It reminded me of a more methodical mix of A Short Hike and Wandersong.  </p>

<p>Also, here’s the thread from last weekend with folks giving their early impressions: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/vbh5cr/the_steam_next_fest_june_2022_edition_is_live/">link</a> (special shout out to <a href="/u/cthulhusmonocle">/u/cthulhusmonocle</a> for their incredible write ups in both quality and quantity - seriously, check out their posts in that thread).</p>

With over 400 demos and 5 days to play them, I wanted to hear impressions and thoughts.  Any games stood out the most?  Try a game that really surprised you?  With one day left, any games you’d recommend someone try?</p>

<p>I have to recommend <strong>TOEM</strong>.  It’s a lovely adventure game where you run around beautiful, unique levels and use your camera ala-ish Pokemon Snap to complete interesting tasks for funny, creative characters.  Very polished and well done.</p>

<h2>Total War: WARHAMMER III Global Gameplay Reveal | Full Showcase</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/ilovesharkpeople </span><span class = "numcomments">211 comments </span><a href="/r/Games/comments/nbjchf/total_war_warhammer_iii_global_gameplay_reveal/gy0ooa9/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(651)">View full post</button><div id="651" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Zerkovich on youtube has some good tutorials. But if you want some general tips to get yourself started, I&#39;ll repost my usual response I use over on <a href="/r/totalwar">r/totalwar</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>In vortex, do NOT worry if you get behind on rituals. If an enemy faction finishes theirs, you get a quest battle where you can defeat them and stop the ritual. Don&#39;t feel rushed. And BE READY for the armies that will spawn and attack your ritual sites. </li>
<li>When deciding what you want in your army, think about what would work well together. For example, if you have a lot of archers, you&#39;ll want something to protect them. Since archers are good against infantry but need something to protect them against cavalry, spearmen are a good complement. You can still have trouble with artillery that outranges you, so you may also want support from your own artillery to shoot back or fast cavalry/flying units to go take out their long range support.</li>
<li>When fighting battles, try to figure out how to do it with as few losses as possible. If you win a battle at the cost of your army being completely crippled, you&#39;re not ready for the next fight and your victory was ultimately meaningless. This means being careful with your squishy damage dealing units (i.e. having them go around and flank after the enemy meets your front line, instead of using them <em>as</em> a front line), microing your fast units well, identifying key units that you need to kill (such as artillery) and taking advantage of terrain features and any sort of ranged or magic advantage you might have. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDxk6T3Y8e8">Effective army formations</a> should also help you have easier, cleaner battles. And if you&#39;re using gunpowder units, there are a number of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/NnQdt#uRh1OA0">good formations and tactics</a> you can use to ensure that they keep firing throughout a battle. <strong>Good formations should make your battles easier to play</strong></li>
<li>Morale is important! Units with high leadership will not break and run away. Heroes and lords being nearby units will help them not break. You can also try to break enemy units - attacking them from the rear, charging them, casting spells on them and shelling them with artillery are all useful tools to break enemy units. </li>
<li>Speaking of routing, you may want at least one fast unit in your army. When a unit begins to rout, they still can rally and recover. If you want them gone for good, send a unit of hounds or cavalry to chase them off the battlefield, wipe them out or &quot;shatter&quot; them (they&#39;ll get a skull icon over their heads and cannot come back).</li>
<li>Speaking of Cavalry, both Cav and Chariots are especially good when charging. They get a big bonus whenever they are running at a target and collide into them. This bonus only lasts a couple seconds, so try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVN-nuQRbto">&quot;cycle charging&quot;</a> for maximum effect.</li>
<li>Magic is very good in this game. If possible, get at least one spellcaster in all of your armies. A high level wizard can completely change the outcome of a battle.</li>
<li>Monsters are also good. They can be magnets for missiles and get swarmed by spears, but being so huge gives them a ton of mass. You can use them to crash through enemy lines and physically shove their way through enemy infantry. They also benefit from the fact that they do not lose effectiveness as they take damage. A unit of infantry or cavalry will take casualties (and deal less damage due to having fewer models) as it takes damage, but a War Mammoth will fight just as well at 14,000 or 14 hp.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get involved in too many wars at once. Fighting wars on multiple fronts is always harder than when you can focus on one. </li>
<li>When choosing your wars, evaluate who else doesn&#39;t like you or would be likely to attack when your forces are elsewhere. Also consider how hard it would be to defend your newly conquered territory when you have won. Expanding along a narrow strip with multiple hostile factions on all sides might not be as valuable as going for an enemy that is surrounded by your own allies.</li>
<li>Keep your reliability rating high for diplomacy. This means you don&#39;t declare war on people you have treaties with. If you do, your reliability goes down and more people declare war on you since you are seen as volatile and dangerous. If you want to end your treaties and go to war with someone, cancel them, wait ten turns and then declare war. That will allow you to declare war without any reliability hit.</li>
<li>Speaking of diplomacy, be <em>very</em> careful about military allies in TWW2. It looks nice on paper, but a military ally may drag you into more wars than you&#39;d like. A military ally is also very difficult to confederate. You can still be friendly with the faction and not sign <em>all</em> the treaties.</li>
<li>Keep some heroes as agents. Get &quot;specialist&quot; to make their agent actions cheaper. You want them to scout ahead before moving your army, wounding enemy agents, boosting your research, blocking enemy army movement and damaging walls for sieges. </li>
<li>Be <em>very</em> careful when using forced march. It will make your units tired in battle and make it impossible for you to withdraw when attacked. Good scouting will help you know when you are safe. Also, if you fight in forced march you will be <a href="https://totalwarwarhammer.gamepedia.com/Fatigue">exhausted</a>. That&#39;s not good.</li>
<li>Build walls in vulnerable settlements. Walls make the AI take several turns before they will launch an attack on your city, buying time to defend it. It also boosts your garrisons which can often just win a battle on their own. When defending against overwhelming forces, get off the walls as soon as the enemy reaches them. It seems bad to surrender them, but there are usually very good chokepoints in your walled settlements you can set up as kill boxes to even the odds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvsF-uLN8">Here&#39;s an example of what I&#39;m talking about</a>. There are some exceptions where you do want to hold the walls but using chokepoints is <em>usually</em> the better option.</li>
<li>On the subject of sieges, I <em>highly</em> advise you make sure your army has a siege attacker (artillery and many of the monsters in this game have that trait) to allow you to immediately launch an attack on a settlement. If you sit outside building siege equipment for several turns you are asking for enemy reinforcements to come sandwich you. If you need some equipment go ahead and build it, but be <em>very</em> careful. Also, if you have several artillery pieces you may want to destroy an enemy tower first, creating a dead zone in their defenses that will let your army advance safely without being shot at by defensive towers.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t expand too far too fast. More territory is good, but <em>only</em> if you can hold it. If not, sack and raze the enemy to weaken them and fill your coffers. And if you do expand too far, be willing to cut your losses. If you lose a couple settlements it&#39;s not a big deal. Protect the important ones in a crisis. You can always go reconquer stuff later.</li>
<li>Growth and money are <em>always</em> good. Build up your infrastructure wherever you can. Get the recruiting buildings you need for your army, but don&#39;t build them in every province - set up some provinces as recruiting centers, and devote others to what you need to get more advanced technologies and funding your empire.</li>
<li>Keep a decent amount of income flowing each turn. Don&#39;t spend every penny on army upkeep - you will likely have lots of buildings to upgrade as you expand and tech up. You want to be able to pay for those buildings to help your empire continue to develop.</li>
<li>Lightning Strike and ambush are <em>really</em> good. If you are overwhelmed by an enemy, go into ambush stance and bait them into what the AI thinks is an undefended settlement. You&#39;ll get a better engagement and only have to fight one army at a time. Lightning strike (available if you level it up on your lord) is also a handy tool. It lets you fight enemy armies one by one as long as you are on the attack. This means you can pick apart a clump of enemies one by one. Picking off armies apart one at a time is <em>way</em> easier than fighting four stacks and 80 units at once.</li>
<li>Combat stats can be a little confusing. If you&#39;re unclear about what exactly stuff like ward save and melee defense do, you may want to read <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/jw7rck/more_wh2_questions/gconib0/?context=3">this rundown I wrote</a>. And don&#39;t worry, this one is actually short!</li>
</ul>

<p>Few other more advanced things:</p>

<p>First, overcasting. You can double click a spell you have leveled up for a more powerful (though more expensive) version of a spell. This can be very important for armies/factions that rely heavily on magic. Invocation of nehek for vampires, for example, normally heals one unit and overcast heals 4 in an aoe. The descriptions in your skill tree will describe how each spell is changed when overcast.</p>

<p>Some important hotkeys. The game tells you some in tutorials, but these ones are tucked away in a menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;J&quot; turns a unit around</p></li>
<li><p>Hold alt and drag with your mouse mouse to move all selected units while maintaining their current formation</p></li>
<li><p>Alt-ctrl and drag to rotate while maintaining current formation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Skirmish, melee and Guard Mode. These are things you can enable/disable during a battle. They are buttons at the very bottom middle of your screen that come up when you select a unit. If you have a ranged unit, forcing melee only mode will make them go into close combat instead of shooting. This can be handy with units with melee stats that are as good or better than their ranged ones. Skirmish mode makes your ranged units run away when an enemy unit gets close to them. You will generally want this off, because they rarely actually maintain distance from the enemy and can spend the whole battle running away instead of shooting. And guard mode makes it so that your units won&#39;t go running off after retreating units. It also allows you to fire with some artillery units even if they are being attacked in melee.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/lvahjd/another_20_upcoming_indieaa_games/"><strong>Here’s a link to the third post with the third set of 20 games.</strong></a></p>

<p>With so many games releasing nowadays, I think it&#39;s easy for the good ones to get lost in the shuffle. I&#39;m going to list 20 highly anticipated Indie/AA games. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many great ones I&#39;ll probably miss (like I said, there&#39;s so many it&#39;s hard to keep track sometimes), so please let me know what other ones I should look out for. <strong>I’m going to order them by release date.</strong> If the game does not have a tangible release date, I’ll place it in the list based on what I think is more likely to come out first, based on marketing material and release date delays.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cyber Shadow</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8Rjb9J2">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 2D Action Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This game looks like a cyberfunk (real word is getting the post removed by the automoderator) Ninja Gaiden.  It&#39;s very fast paced and has some huge enemies to fight. The player character looks to have a very versatile moveset which looks to complement both the platforming and the combat. This is apparently the work of one guy, making it all that much more impressive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Little Nightmares II</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Gj63w0V">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> Little Nightmares was a big indie success back in 2017, and the sequel looks to lean heavier into its horror elements.

</ul>

<p><strong>3. It Takes Two</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/NlkpWNY">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 3D Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> Local Co-op Only</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This comes from the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and Nights into Dreams. It&#39;s a 3D platformer with a dreamlike carnival theme. You&#39;ll wear a number of different costumes (80+ according to the game description) that grant different abilities. The game also has a Chao Garden-like feature for Sonic Adventure fans. The adorable little creatures in this game are called “Tims.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. King’s Bounty II</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> The original King’s Bounty released all the way back in 1990, which also spawned a board game in 1991. It wouldn’t receive a follow-up until 2008 when King’s Bounty: The Legend released. Four expansions would be released between 2009 and 2014. While traditionally a PC exclusive series, King’s Bounty II will mark the first time the series comes to consoles.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Clive ‘N’ Wrench</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fXqg7l6">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 3D Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This game has been in development for 10 years now and is clearly inspired by Banjo Kazooie. The game follows a tag team duo – a rabbit and a monkey – through 11 different worlds in a collectathon-style platformer. The two characters like act as one unit to perform certain moves, just as it was in Banjo Kazooie.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. 30XX</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VROn5IX">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Vqdmoe8to">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029210/30XX/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Roguelike/2D Action Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> Local &amp; Online Co-op</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> 30XX is the sequel to 2014’s 20XX. This is a Mega Man X inspired roguelike with both local and online co-op. There were eight characters with different abilities to play as in 20XX, and it looks like a similar approach is kept for the sequel. Despite taking place 1000 years after the original, Ace and Nina at least, are still present in 30XX.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8. Hollow Knight Silksong</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/50YFg1X">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxwbZsL14Y">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Metroidvania</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> 2017’s Hollow Knight is one of the biggest indie games of all time, in both its popularity and scale of the game. Silksong was originally just meant to be a DLC for the original game, but the project expanded into a full-scale sequel. The original is probably the single most popular indie Metroidvania out there, so there’s a lot of hype for the sequel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9. Psychonauts 2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/C5yRzvF">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6SRtNZb_D4">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 3D Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This has been a very long time coming, but with all the gameplay footage and marketing material coming out for the game, it seems Psychonauts 2 will finally release in 2021. The first game released in 2005 – three PlayStations ago – and was a cult classic. The director of the first game, Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango, Brutal Legend, Broken Age, etc.) is also directing the sequel, so there is a lot of hope from the fanbase.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>10. Solar Ash Kingdom</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/99P8bJT">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 3D Adventure</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This comes from the same developer as Hyper Light Drifter. Solar Ash Kingdom has a lot of the same stylized aesthetics as Hyper Light Drifter, but this is a fully 3D over the shoulder adventure. You’ll engage with massive enemies, traverse the world at high speeds, and meet many characters throughout the adventure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>11. Sports Story</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/IVpYzVu">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzzcgCi20Z8">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>eShop Page:</em> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sports-story-switch/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> RPG</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> From the creators of Golf Story - a fusion of golf and RPG elements. This sequel includes golf, tennis, volleyball, soccer, and baseball. You’ll also engage in a variety of typical RPG adventure stuff, like exploring dungeons and engaging in side quests. The first one reviewed well and was one of the biggest indie hits in the first year of the Switch (2017).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>12. Heavenly Bodies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yjTueWN">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLIA4Jm8JfI">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1138850/Heavenly_Bodies/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Co-op Focused Physics-based Adventure</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> Local Co-op Only</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> Heavenly Bodies follows two cosmonauts in the 1970s who must work together through a series of physics-based challenges. While the game is built around the co-op experience, the game can still be played in single player. While this is only local co-op at the moment, the Steam page seems to suggest that the developer is looking into options for online play.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>13. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/W9JSS9d">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibDx3ueg90U">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117850/Cuphead__The_Delicious_Last_Course/">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> 2021</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Run &amp; Gun</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> Local Co-op Only</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This is technically a DLC, but given the wait for it, I think it’s fair to expect a fairly sizeable one. This DLC will introduce a new playable character, Ms. Chalice, who will have a double jump and possibly other differentiating moves. This DLC was originally supposed to release in 2019, but it’s been delayed a number of times. For reference, the original game released in 2017 and took seven years to make (though the two brothers responsible for the game had day jobs and a much smaller team up until 2014).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14. Brave Earth: Prologue</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/U7Xw2Qa">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 2D Action Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This comes from Kayin, the creator of I Wanna Be the Guy. This is an NES Castlevania inspired game with three playable characters that have unique paths and differing abilities. The game will also feature cutscenes and over a dozen different levels. The game has been in development for years now and is near completion.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><em>Description:</em> <a href="https://www.aloftstudio.com/hbdemobuilds">Hazelnut Bastille actually has a 2-3 hour demo with a full dungeon included,</a> which I didn&#39;t know about until just now as I was making this list! Heavily inspired by top down Zelda games, these games have some really beautiful looking art. Development for Hazelnut Bastille began back in April 2016. Dawnthorn, a prequel to Hazelnut Bastille, will also be releasing around the same time in 2021. Dawnthorn will emulate the look of an NES game, while Hazelnut Bastille will look more like an SNES game.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>16. Freedom Planet 2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BlzLbIi">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Sonic-like 2D Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> The original Freedom Planet was initially conceived as a Sonic fangame before the the creator, Stephen DiDuro, reconceptualized it as his own IP. The sequel was announced back in 2015, a year after the original’s release, and will introduce new mechanics and make changes based on feedback from the first game.  </p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> 2D Action Platformer</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This game comes from the creators of Crawl and Regular Human Basketball, two highly acclaimed competitive local multiplayer games. Unlike their previous work, this looks to be a campaign/adventure game, but it also has a demonic narrator just like Crawl. They&#39;re also making The Drifter right now.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>18. Cassette Beasts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BzvSEOK">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-bD1Pf3xGY">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Pokemon-like Turn-Based RPG</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> Local Co-op Only</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> From the creators of Lenna&#39;s Inception, Bytten Studio, which released on Steam in January of this year – a randomly generated Zelda inspired local co-op action adventure game with two art styles to switch between. The two guys behind the game have also worked on Starbound, Stardew Valley, and Wargroove, so they have quite a pedigree of games. Cassette Beasts in heavily inspired by Pokemon and includes 120 beasts that can be combined for a total of 14,400 fusions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>19. Witchbrook</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/eLCUypY">Link</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Trailer:</em> N/A</p></li>
<li><p><em>Steam Page:</em> N/A</p></li>
<li><p><em>Release Date:</em> Unannounced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Genre:</em> Action RPG</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This comes from the creators of Wargroove. Witchbrook will allow you to experience high school as a wizard. A website for the game was launched back in September, so it seems progress on the game is coming along. The website seems to suggest you’ll be able to develop relationships based on your choices in the game.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>20. Witchfire</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Picture:</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XoCkHpK">Link</a></p></li>

<li><p><em>Multiplayer:</em> None Announced</p></li>
<li><p><em>Description:</em> This comes from the same developer as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, The Astronauts, but instead of just walking, you&#39;ll be walking and shooting demonic creatures. If this game reminds you of Painkiller from 2004, it&#39;s because director Adrian Chmielarz actually worked on that game. The game has been worked on for five years now by a team of nine full members and three contributors, so hopefully we&#39;ll see it soon.</p></li>
