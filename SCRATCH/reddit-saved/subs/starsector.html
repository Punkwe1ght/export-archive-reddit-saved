<p>Even in normal/non-modded game the prices could get like a 2x boost officialy I think.</p>

<p>That would also include sell prices so you could be recovering ships and selling them for 30k instead of scrapping them cause they would be sold for 3k</p>

<p>I am really impressed by the depth of mechanics in this game.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I wanted to start a thread for suggestions of other games that have great depth and gameplay.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Some of my mentions:</p>

<p>- Rimworld, Stellaris, Terraria, Runescape, Project Zomboid, Heroes III, Civ VI, Path of Exile, Dyson Sphere Program, Factorio, Oxygen Not Included, Tabletop Simulator (for board games like Eclipse, Twilight Imperium), Don&#39;t Starve Together, X4: Foundations, Mount and Blade II, Darkest Dungeon</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Most of the above are pretty well known. Let me know if you have lesser known mentions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad others mentioned Starsector, as it&#39;s not on steam and I would&#39;ve never found it.</p>

I also have a couple ships I use for strictly storage and one fuel tanker. Honestly it &#39;works&#39; but I know for a fact it could be working a lot better, mainly because of the immense fuel drain I have from all the frigates and their relative weakness in full scale combat. (also not to mention the fact that I literally just strap on all the weapons that have super high ordinance costs, because monkey brain go &quot;high number mean better gun&quot;)</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m asking is, does anyone have any pointers for someone with a very and I mean <em>very</em> barebones understanding of the game?

I have a 4k monitor. In theory, I should be able to play at 1080p without too much of an issue but it simply will not work in this game. The game window just stays in the top left corner no matter what I do. I have an amd 6800 gpu.</p>

<p>Integer scaling in AMD control panel doesn&#39;t work. Setting my monitor to 1080p in windows also doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I am aware that game is built on a lot of raster / pixel elements which makes stuff like this tricky. And that, until recently, the game didn&#39;t support anything besides 1080p. </p>

<p>Surely there should be a way to make this work. I&#39;m not trying to play on some crazy ultrawide or an ancient 4:3 monitor. </p>

<p>Anyone figured this out? Couldn&#39;t find any solutions from past threads, just other people complaining about the same problem.</p>

<p>Edit-just to clarify, I&#39;m not saying I can&#39;t play any game at 1080p on my monitor, I&#39;m just having an issue with Star Sector.</p>

Couldn&#39;t stand watching decked out archers and gryphons get own zoned by lone frigates, just floundering like dead fish as they were slowly chipped away, refusing to fire a single missile because the frickin kite/wolf&#39;s shields were up.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, I have discovered the trick.</p>

<p>If you set your missiles to the same fire group as your PD, your missile boats will go full scorched earth and spam every single missile they&#39;re packing at any target within range. As it should be.</p>

<p>No more watching your gryphon get bullied by a shrimp while packing enough harpoons to melt an onslaught.</p>

<h2>Not sure how or where to build your colonies? I made a web app that can help you decide.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(463)">View full post</button><div id="463" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p>

<p>I developed a web app that Starsector players can use to experiment with different colony builds and find good planets to colonize. It lets you specify how you want to build your (size-6) colonies, then reads your save file and simulates those colonies on planets in your sector, showing you how they&#39;ll turn out.</p>

<p>I tried to make the simulation as accurate as possible. It factors in accessibility, hazard rating, planetary conditions, structure configurations (improvements, AI cores, and special items), administrators, cross-faction imports, and the demand for commodities in your economy. So it can help you decide whether to colonize a nearby planet with a low hazard rating or a more distant planet with more resources or better conditions for special items, for example.</p>

<p>The search results are sorted by profitability, but you can also see statistics like stability, fleet size, ship quality, and ground defenses.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll only show fully-surveyed planets by default, but you can configure it to show spoilers as well if you want to.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

<p><a href="https://gomtuu.org/starsearcher/">https://gomtuu.org/starsearcher/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve tested it with vanilla Starsector 0.95.1a-RC6 save files.</p>

<p>By the way, you can also use it to share colony builds. For example, here are <a href="https://gomtuu.org/starsearcher/#1001PSSWAMLiOOGGQ,0101PSSWMaaFOOGGQQ,0111PSSWRHHaaFaOOGGQ">the colonies GrumpyThumper built</a> in his Zero To Hero videos.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It starts with the fact that missiles have limited ammo. That mean if a shot does not hit what it&#39;s supposed to hit, then it&#39;s extremely punishing. Compound with the strength of PD weapons and fighters, 9 out of 10 they would just whiff completely. Even if the target have no way to shoot them down, I notices a lot of case they just tank it with the preferable surface. Fire high explosive at them and they raise their shield just right. Fire sabot at them and they lower the shield to block with their armor. So the missiles themselves never really does the full potential damage. The only time they work is when a ship is suffering overload (almost never happen. The AI is very good at that) or when it is in the middle of a long venting (but only if there&#39;s nothing around to provide cover fire) </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I am doing wrong, but right now I feel like every single ordance point does toward missiles is a complete waste that would have better served as more ballistic and energy, or additional flux for those ballistic and energy.</p>

<h2>Starsector Mods - Any Additional Recommended Mods?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Risenking666 </span><span class = "numcomments">2 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/vktjr2/starsector_mods_any_additional_recommended_mods/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(487)">View full post</button><div id="487" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got into Starsector a few weeks ago and played 20+ hour already. I was midway through my first playthrough and loving it but then I noticed that the number of NPC colonies/worlds were static and unchanging. I did some googling and discovered that, in the base game, NPC factions do not expand and the whole sandbox was rather static in the long-run. This disappointed me as I could already foresee the end game where there&#39;s no more new/unknown systems to explore and the base game would have only very few things to keep me interested (eg: the same randomly generated bounties over and over). However, then I discovered Nexerelin and all the other magnificent mods the community has created!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve attached a screenshot of all the mods I&#39;ve downloaded thus far and which I intend to use to start a new game. Is there any other mods you would recommend? Also, are there any mods on my list you would advise me against using, either because there are known bugs/integration issues with other mods or if there are elements to the mod that would make the gameplay too complicated/overwhelming/not fun for whatever reason?</p>

<p>What I want to get out of the game: a 4x game with a reasonable number of new additional factions (not too many as to make the game feel crowded) to make the game dynamic more interesting. For new factions, I prefer for their ships to be balanced/unique and not too OP, additional gameplay elements (like stronger/more unique roaming pirate fleets or new bounties are a definite PLUS).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>What faction mods do you play with?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(497)">View full post</button><div id="497" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I, for my part, settled on dassult-mikoyan and SCY. Everything else seems like a reskin.</p>

<p>Mikoyan i like for the aesthetic and for the amazing normandie carriers(and some of its weapons are better than vanilla equivalents). Most mikoyan ships aren&#39;t the best most op ones, but are very well suited to exploration-combat. Mikoyan stuff feels high-end but balanced - powerful mikoyan weapons all can&#39;t sustain rate of fire, their missiles with a lot of ammo don&#39;t do as much damage as the vanilla ones, etc. Normanie is shamelessly OP though, but it&#39;s fair since fighters suck compared to like a paragon.</p>

<p>SCY nation&#39;s ships look cool but are crap, and their weapons are mostly worse than vanilla ones, but the faction itself is probably the most unique among modded ones. I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>What are your favourites?</p>

This will help you find weapons that work best with your playstyle and ship by telling you how effective in combat each ship and its associated weapons were. Look at the readme and write down the command somewhere.</p>

Also allows you to view sector market prices.</p>

<p><a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=81d37da2ae4d25a62481318d4af05817&amp;topic=18994.0">Ship direction marker</a>. Shows which direction your ship is going which might seem intuitive but can be difficult to figure out during combat.</p>

Lightweight but cool enough to warrant a mention.</p>

<h2>Tactical combat tutorial</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/SigurdCole </span><span class = "numcomments">7 comments </span><a href="/r/starsector/comments/v0me4k/tactical_combat_tutorial/iahjgdz/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(530)">View full post</button><div id="530" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a newer player, so my knowledge isn&#39;t deep, but....</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the way command points work is &quot;unlimited orders for a limited period of time&quot;. I almost always spend a command point right at the beginning, setting escorts and behaviors. Easily a half dozen orders, only one command point.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that CR under 50% incurs penalties, and under 40% incurs malfunctions. You&#39;ll likely be pulling entire classes of ships off the battlefield at once.</p>

<p>Commands can be a little finicky. Setting an enemy target to &quot;eradicate&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to do anything, but assigning ships to that target seems to work. OTOH, switching off &quot;eradicate&quot; does free up all the assigned ships at once.</p>

<p>A lot depends on your fleet comp and progression. For example, I have a handful of cruisers and a decent spread of destroyers and frigates, so my current fleet looks like this:</p>

<p>Cruisers: 1x Eradicator, 2x Falcon (P), 1x Apogee (starting cruiser)</p>

<p>Destroyers: 2x Hammerhead, 2x Enforcer, 1x Drover (1x Broadswords and 1x Khopesh), 1x Manticore</p>

<p>Frigates: 4x Centurion, 2x Wolf, 4x Scarab</p>

<ul>
<li>At combat start, I set the Centurions and Wolves to Escort. Everything else is set to &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot;

<ul>
<li>The Wolves are PD-fitted, so they escort the Falcons, cos they&#39;re a little squishier than I like. The Centurions escort the Hammerheads, the Manticore and the Apogee - Centurions are super tanky.</li>
<li>The Drover is equipped with stuff over 1k range - if it gets into close combat, I&#39;ve screwed up somewhere. OTOH, it&#39;s fielding heavy fighters and torpedo bombers, so it&#39;s a great contribution at range. I generally leave it on &quot;seek and destroy&quot; for the whole fight.</li>
<li>Scarabs are extremely maneuverable, and their special means they can burst very hard or retreat very quickly. I cut them loose at the start of the fight, and they&#39;ll either distract destroyers or chew up frigates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Eradicator hits like a truck and has Burn Drive, but its base speed is really slow. It&#39;s the anvil, the Falcons are the hammer.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll generally let the fleet engage freely unless I see an opportunity to defeat in detail. If there&#39;s a chance to pile three destroyers or cruisers onto a single destroyer or cruiser, I&#39;ll take it.</li>
<li>Once something beefy shows up on the other side, I set the Eradicator on it, and not commit any other ships until they&#39;re toe-to-toe.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll generally order ships to retreat once I get the &quot;going to start losing combat readiness&quot; message, since that&#39;s usually the escorts. By the time they have to pull back, they&#39;ve generally done their job soaking fighters, missiles and frigates. Besides, often enough you get an engagement or two back-to-back - may as well stay fresh.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m new, so take it all with a grain of salt, and I&#39;ll be happy to get feedback. But I&#39;ve engaged pirates, pathers and [REDACTED] with this fleet, including taking out pather and pirate stations, without losses.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>Vanilla Balanced Modpacks</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(539)">View full post</button><div id="539" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Anything done by authors Dark Revenant or Tartiflette is vanilla balanced, and has been iterated toward such for years. DR in particular wrote a years-old topic for the standards to keep faction/ship mods vanilla balanced as well in the forums. I also hear that Star Federation may be as well, but I&#39;m not 100% clear on that. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll likely want to avoid mods that add hullmods too or at least give them some major scrutiny, more options will always = more power and I hear that some of them are a little insane balance-wise besides.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s a list of mods that I use:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Audio Plus</li>
<li>BattleTech Portrait Pack</li>
<li>Blackrock Drive Yards (Used to be on the high-end of vanilla balance last I played, looks like someone made a compatability patch but no idea if they changed anything balance wise. Ships/Weapons make very strong player ships, but aren&#39;t as good when used by AI.)</li>
<li>Captain&#39;s Log</li>
<li>Combat Chatter</li>
<li>Console Commands</li>
<li>Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering (Has gotten better with balance, but still on the high-end of vanilla power especially fighters. Avoid Brave Blade start if you want balance. Solid mod made by Harmful Mechanic who also made Magellan Protectorate but I haven&#39;t used that one yet so I can&#39;t say how it is.)</li>
<li>Deluxe Player Flags</li>
<li>Detailed Combat Results</li>
<li>Diable Avionics (Made by Tartiflette)</li>
<li>Star Federation (Just started using this, so can&#39;t add any opinions.)</li>
<li>GraphicsLib</li>
<li>LazyLib</li>
<li>MagicLib</li>
<li>DroneLib</li>
<li>Interstellar Imperium (Made by DR)</li>
<li>Lightshow (Makes it easier to differentiate vanilla beams, like the Ion beam from the Graviton beam mostly.)</li>
<li>Logistics Notification</li>
<li>Luddic Enhancement (Gives a much needed buff to the LC ship-wise and campaign-wise for the modiverse. LP get annoying, meme ships that you either defeat with cheese tactics or take losses tho so up to you.)</li>
<li>Nexerelin</li>
<li>ORA (Made by Tartiflette. An energy based broadsider faction)</li>
<li>Portrait Pack</li>
<li>SCY (Made by Tartiflette)</li>

<h2>Quick Modding Guides: How to Install Mods | How to Allocate More RAM | Things to Tweak in settings.json</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(550)">View full post</button><div id="550" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I get a lot of questions asking how to set up Starsector or start modding Starsector.  So I wanted to just put a few quick guides out there.  I&#39;ve created video guides as well since some people like those better, but if you&#39;re more like me and prefer a written guide you can reference, here it is below.</p>

<p><strong>How to Install Mods in Starsector:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Kuc_qOHdlWM">video link</a></p>

<p>1) Find your starsector root directory (by default it&#39;s likely C:/program files (x86)/Fractal Softworks/Starsector and find the folder named mods</p>

<p>2) The best place to find specific mods for the game is the Fractal Softworks Official Forums.  I&#39;m a big fan of the <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=177.0">Mod Index</a> they have stickied over there because it&#39;s well organized and lists what&#39;s up to date with the current version (as of this writing 95.1a).  Don&#39;t forget that some mods require other mods (dependencies) to run.  Some of the more popular ones are the various Libraries (e.g. GraphicsLib).</p>

<p>3) Once downloaded, unzip/extract those mods directly into the Starsector/mods folder.</p>

<p>4) When you open Starsector, click the word “Mods...” under the Start Game button and enable all mods or any mods you want to run.</p>

<p>5) Start the game.  It should run.  Hopefully.</p>

<p><strong>How to Set Memory Allocation with vmparams:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/HN6FZ-moYPE">video link</a></p>

<p>0) Please note that you&#39;ll need administrator access to do this and the ability to change a file type.</p>

<p>1) Find the file vmparams in your Starsector root directory.  Make a backup of it.  Then open it with Notepad.</p>

<p>2) You&#39;ll see a line of javascript.  By default, Starsector is set to allocate 1.5 GB of system RAM for the game.  This is what -Xms and -Xmx refer to (note that they are the same value).  -Xss refers to Video RAM.  I&#39;ve never needed to adjust this from the default 2048 (2 GB) allotment.  </p>

<p>3) Change the value in <strong>-Xms####m</strong> and <strong>-Xms####m</strong> to one of the following.  They need to be the same value:</p>

<ul>
<li>1536</li>
<li>2048</li>
<li>3072</li>
<li>4096</li>
<li>6144 &lt;&lt;&lt; This is what I use in my modded save games.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> do not try to make available more RAM than your system has free, and do not try to make available more RAM than your system has total.  Every computer is different.  You should know your system.  </p>

<p>4) In Notepad, SAVE AS with the file name vmparams.  This will create a text file.</p>

<p>5) Starsector won&#39;t need a text file, so you&#39;ll need to remove the .txt and just leave it as a file that is simply called vmparams.  There are a lot of ways to do this, but it involves having admin access and/or permissions on the computer.  Or using an external program.  I demonstrate one method in the video (showing hidden file extensions then manually deleting the file extension).</p>

<p>6) Run Starsector.  If you did everything correctly it should start without a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Other Settings Tweaks You Can Make Without Installing Mods:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/9raCoBn-DQI">video link</a></p>

<p>1) Go to your Starsector directory and then go through the following folders: starsector-core &gt;&gt;&gt; data &gt;&gt;&gt; config.  </p>

<p>2) Inside of Starsector/starsector-core/data there will be a file called <strong>settings.json</strong>.  Open it is, as this is an important file to handle the global settings of the game.</p>

<p>3) Here are some of the settings I get asked about the most:</p>

<p><strong>enableShipExplosionWhiteout</strong>: set from true to false in order to stop getting blinded every time a ship explodes</p>

<p><strong>maxBattleSize</strong>: set this to whatever total amount of deployment points you want available in the pool for ship combat.  I find that 700 or 800 lets a lot more capital ships enter the battle instead of having to wait to deploy until after other ships get destroyed.  You can go crazy and go high.  You can also change the minimum setting, although functionally this doesn&#39;t do much as you can always deploy below the points available.</p>

<p><strong>baseNumOfficers</strong>: increases the number of officers you can hire.  The number used here is one without additional skills that give you more officers.  You can (and should) set the AI&#39;s officer limit to match this.  However, note that some story/AI fleets can bypass this cap requirement.</p>

<p><strong>maxShipsInFleet</strong> : similar idea to above.  Want to go higher than 30 ships available in your fleet? This is how you do it.  Especially nice if you want to drag more frigates around.  There is a setting to change the AI fleet cap, but honestly after upping it to 50 I have yet to see significant changes in the size of AI fleets.</p>

<p>4) Commentor <strong>Tartiflette</strong> gave some great additional options:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;altMouseMoveToMassTransfer&quot;:true</strong>, (press alt and move your mouse to easily unload all your looted weapons)</p>

<p><strong>&quot;smallClouds&quot;:false</strong>, (for better looking nebulas, big performance impact though)</p>

<p><strong>&quot;enableUIStaticNoise&quot;:false</strong>, (easier on the eye, also helps a LOT if you are streaming as it will prevent the image from temporarily becoming a blurry mess)</p>

<p><strong>&quot;shipRecoveryDialogShowBothListsAtOnce&quot;:true</strong>, (kind of a nice QoL feature when salvaging supposedly buggy but I never had any issue))</p>

<h2>[GUIDE] Commanding fleets in battle</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/del-ra </span><span class = "numcomments">21 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/sw5yvo/guide_commanding_fleets_in_battle/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(551)">View full post</button><div id="551" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been playing this game non-stop for a couple months now, fought a lot of battles and since I&#39;m not a very good pilot a lot of them I watched from the map view. I wanted to write down how I command my fleets after all this experience. Hope it helps newer players.</p>

<p>Preparation:</p>

<p>Regardless of its theme, my fleet is built according to very simple rules. Two capital ships which I pilot myself, neural-linked so they both can take advantage from my skills. Ten cruisers for my ten level 6 officers. Then I have as many frigates and destroyers as the fleet limit allows to serve as screens for the ships above. My officers are all of Aggressive personality, while my fleet&#39;s doctrine is set to Steady. This means that my cruisers (piloted by officers) are the ones trying to make a break in the enemy line and risk the most, while my other ships (the two capitals I pilot myself and my frail frigates/destroyers) stay on the careful side of things and don&#39;t try to get themselves into trouble.</p>

<p>Execution:</p>

<p>At the beginning of the battle I do the following: I select my flagship (pressing &quot;1&quot;) and press &quot;U&quot; for autopilot. I select each ship with an officer and press &quot;L&quot; to assign a frigate or a destroyer to screen them. They will go together everywhere, lean on each other, hide behind each other, intercept attacks against one another. This heavily reduces random combat losses. Then I select the two nearest Objectives on the map and press &quot;C&quot; for my frigates to be dispatched to capture them. I select the two objectives that are nearest to enemy and press &quot;A&quot;, which sends the entirety of my fleet that way.</p>

<p>After that, three things happen. Enemy scouts show up and I immediately mark them with &quot;C&quot; to be intercepted and killed. Objectives nearest me are captured by my frigates and I select each of them and press &quot;C&quot; again to make my ships no longer care about them (otherwise you&#39;ll see green movement arrows from some of your ships to those objectives, meaning they are assigned to defend what doesn&#39;t need defending). Third thing, enemy captures his nearest objective, giving up his location, which means I can downgrade the other uncaptured objective from &quot;A&quot; (send entire fleet) to &quot;C&quot; (send a couple ships tops rather than half the fleet). If enemy scouts withdraw back to the bulk of enemy fleet, I unmark them as targets with another press of &quot;C&quot;. Then I deselect the final objective (the one my enemy captured) with &quot;A&quot; so my ships stop bee-lining towards it. I want them to approach enemy in a wide front, rather than a line.</p>

<p>Then - I let the battle go on for a while without interrupting, letting my command points recover. Let my ships form a line and start jousting with enemies. I watch for easy pickings, targets of opportunity that are soft but dangerous (Sunders, Gryphons, all sorts of Carriers, larger phase ships), for enemy ships with overly aggressive officers, for ships that just strayed away from the pack, for very easy kills (like any civilian hulls) - and I will mark them with &quot;C&quot; for my ships to take out. &quot;C&quot; on an enemy ship is &quot;risk your lives trying to kill this&quot;, drive really close to it, so it&#39;s best used sparingly and carefully, sometimes you just can&#39;t take the target ship out and it&#39;s better to unmark it rather than die trying to get it. If enemy has a really powerful ship like a Paragon and that ship is defended on all sides, I might consider using &quot;V&quot; to mark it as something my ships should try to avoid until much later in battle. If I want to take out something that&#39;s a part of enemy line, defended on both sides, a valuable target but a risky one to try to kill, I use the &quot;E&quot; order, which is engage, which is attack this target but don&#39;t get killed while doing it, much milder than &quot;C&quot;. Much more careful approach.</p>

<p>Another thing I do, I keep giving &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; orders for ships that are on enemy flanks, this makes my fleet over time wrap itself around enemy fleet, flanking ships eventually making their way behind enemy line, able to intercept enemies who are withdrawing from battle or those who&#39;d otherwise want to stay behind the line (Condors for example). If the target is something I absolutely want killed immediately regardless of how many lives it takes, I will mark it with &quot;C&quot; and then select a bunch of my ships and right-click that target. This will form yellow arrows to it, so my ships are ordered to basically park themselves in front of it and exchange fire until either of them dies, this is the most aggressive way of attacking something and it will lose you ships, but sometimes there&#39;s just no other way. If any of my ships gets separated from the fleet, is too far  and cut off, I click it and use the &quot;S&quot; order to tell it &quot;you&#39;re on your own, do whatever you want to, disregard my orders&quot;. This prevents stray ships from trying to punch through enemy fleet to get to a target you marked for ships on the other side of enemy line.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s clear I&#39;ve won the battle by sinking most enemies, I click &quot;full assault&quot;. This disengages my lighter ships from screening my larger ships and cancels all my avoid, engage and assault orders. Ships just aggressively attack their nearest enemy and mop up whatever is still alive. In easier battles you can do it much sooner. In harder battles (for example a hard Remnant or two bounty fleets spawning on top of each other), you might need to maintain that order to the bitter end (yours or theirs).</p>

<p>Things I don&#39;t do: &quot;D&quot; order on my own ships. This makes your ships form green arrows to that ship and just midnlessly follow it, park themselves next to it. I never select my ships and right-click other ships of mine either, that&#39;s a yellow movement arrow and also leads to much stupidity. If I want ships to work together, I use &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; or &quot;H&quot; escort orders. I also never select my entire fleet and press &quot;S&quot;, this just makes all ships ignore all my orders, which is the opposite of what I want to achieve.</p>

<p>In general, if you&#39;re new to this game and have trouble in combat, I&#39;d strongly advise reading tooltips for all the possible commands you can issue in combat. Get an idea what you can do and what each action actually results in. The rest is experience, knowing ships and weapons and how to avoid trouble.</p>

<h2>Fleet Composition and Tactics</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(553)">View full post</button><div id="553" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been playing for a while, and I’m pretty sure I’m not trash. I’ve been able to beat fleets with close to similar compositions, and even those who are objectively heavier class than me. But I wonder if there’s room for improvement. </p>

<p>As far as composition, I usually try to have 4-6 frigates before getting destroyers. I try to have 3-4 destroyers before getting cruisers (unless I find one for free) and I’ll cap out around 3-4 of these. And after all that I find I’m at a point to afford the upkeep of a capital, maybe two. I tend to favor midline ships, and low tech/modding. Modded favorites are XLU and Diable Avionics, thought I just downloaded VIC and I’m enjoying those, it they’re so frail.</p>

<p>Tactics wise I go heavy on the light ships at first, focus firing single targets while a single heavy cruiser tries to absorb fire. Then as the battle goes on I send heavier and heavier in.</p>

<p>I’m not struggling but improving is always cool. Any tips from the hive mind?</p>

<button onclick="toggles(556)">View full post</button><div id="556" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I grabbed the game after seeing it talked about in a few places I frequent. Looked up a beginner guide, said grab the wolf and drone tender and follow tutorial.</p>

<p>Got in, did some stuff, salvaged/grabbed the derelicts and...got my ass absolutely <strong><em>handed</em></strong> to me.</p>

<p>Am I supposed to &quot;recruit&quot; all those derelict ships? It feels like that miner gang had just so dang many ships that were way bigger and better armed.</p>

<p>Any tips on how to &quot;git gud&quot; for somebody who has never felt so inadequate at a game ever?</p>

<h2>Things i wish i knew before starting out new to the game :) (Newbie Tips)</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/CnC_CloudBird </span><span class = "numcomments">24 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/spk0k4/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_starting_out_new_to/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(559)">View full post</button><div id="559" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Little foreword: No real reason for this i felt like writing something.I will try to make little sections where i can.My english is not really good, if u find grammatical errors u can keep them.I will probably keep expanding it as i have time.No particular order since im writing this as it pops into my head.</p>

<p>Please feel free to add ur tips &lt;3</p>

<p>General:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ol>
<li>Having a solid number of heavy tools saves lifes.200 is always enough to get the max profit out of any salvage operation.I cant count the times i sold mine just to get stranded because the capital ship i salvaged gave me like 1 unit of fuel.</li>
<li>Better safe then sorry.If u <strong>think</strong> the fleet  that just passed u in deep space might  not be friendly dont stick around to check.Scavengers are the vultures of the outer rims.If they cant find salvage they will make ur fleet might aswell the alternative.</li>
<li>Be quick and i mean mighty quick about selling goods to troubled ports.Just because they had critical demand one day they dont need to have when u get there no matter how short the trip.</li>
<li>DONT SELL COLONY ITEMS.Same goes for alot of the bps.Even though those credits seem mighty fine.Putting them into storage is most of the time the better option.Same for A.I Cores.Bonus tip: independents are mighty fine storing ur alpha cores.</li>
<li>Bps are whats used in ur system defense fleets, having atleast some decent bps lerned is the diffrence between ur systems kicking ass or being a pushover.Also stations use weapon bps.Ever wondered why ur station doesnt do shit?It probably has grav canons in all its large slots, or nothing at all :)</li>
<li>Dont carry stuff around with u ur not willing to lose, critical ship loses happen if ur not repairing them.Ur only losing all ur high value items once trust me.</li>
<li>The hegemony commission while pushed by the game is terrible early on.Literally the biggest warmongers, expect to be hostile to 80% of the factions by cylce 207 and earlier.</li>
<li>If u have a solid 500 Marines and can take on the normal lowtech orbital stations u never have to pay for surplies ever again.Just raid the pirate starworks.</li>
<li>Neutron Stars, Black Holes and Nebulars have a good chance on containing research stations.Making rounds in an wide astroid belt always netted me a mining station when i already threw the towel thinking the system didnt have anything to offer.Orbital Habitats sometimes have the nerve to be in the middle of nowhere without specific reasons.</li>
<li>The industrial skill tree has a perk to freely repair any d mods, as far as im aware even if the ship is mothballed, making drydock restorations irrelevant.The fuel and supply saving skills are worth there salt just for the fact how much money they save u in the long run.Fuel is the better early on choice btw, the extra fuel salvaged will save ur ass more then once.</li>
<li>Salvaging domain probes atleast twice brings about 150-180% the salvage u would normally get.Getting a gamma core is also from my exp. most likely on the sec go round.Its totally possible to just survive on probe salvage while coming back with double u took out its that good compared to other free float salvage.</li>
<li>If u find something like a Eagle, Aurora or any Capital ship that is not an Atlas MK use a storypoint to recover it. It most likely will carry u through midgame.Auroras with a good Officer (Missle, Shield, Target Skills) are in my humble opinion the best ton to dam ships in the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fleet action</p>

<ol>
<li>In a pursuit u can click frigates more then once, this will make them flank from the side of the screen. Tempests, Wolfs and any other small ship with good speed will catch any freighters. A tempest can shred 5 Colouss by its self that way if u order it one by one.</li>
<li>In a losing fight always try too run, if the enemy fleet pops an interdict try to burn out, the slowdown will make it unlikely they burn after u, if they a bit away popping an emergency burn themself wait a sec and pop urs, theres will run out before urs giving u a free escape most of the time. This way u can probably avoid spending a story point.</li>
<li>For quick money as a pirate run with ur transponder off in the core looking for fleets with supply, heavy tools, shiphulls and heavy armaments.those are the biggest payouts rep to credits lost/earned. Try to avoid smugglers and free traders tou, independents are ur best bet if everyone hates u!</li>
<li>Dont underestimate  orbital stations, even the weakest once should be taking alone and with atleast 2 cruisers and 5 destroyers to be safe, better a capital too.Battlestations will probably give u a run for ur money more then once.Midline stations seem to be the weakest when it comes to what is able to overpower them.</li>
<li>Dont be overconfident against pirates, there ships might be flying trash but there numbers can knock u on ur ass very quickly. Try to match them with decent ships atleast 2 to 3 in ratio.</li>
<li>Retreat is valid option if a patrol forces u into fighting a station ur trying to interact with.It wont force u into a pursuit but will harass u badly cutting ur cr in roughtly half.</li>
</ol>

<h2>"Personal Opinion" Best colonie setup for early money. (Newbie Tips)</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/CnC_CloudBird </span><span class = "numcomments">17 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/sq042c/personal_opinion_best_colonie_setup_for_early/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(560)">View full post</button><div id="560" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Colony got nerfed with hazard pay and overall early profits in .95, this is how u still can make very decent profits with one good solo colonie, possibly pathing the way for more colonies.</h1>

<h1>This setup is also great for an self reliant empire reducing import costs for all future colonies to effectivly zero.</h1>

<p>For starters a planet should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Habitable</li>
<li>Have farmland with a bonus, this bonus can go up to +2, it can be done without any bonus, expect lower profits thou.</li>
<li>No transplutonic ores or volatiles, this forbids the use of the colonie item &quot;Soil Nanites&quot; which gives farming a production bonus of +2, any normal ores or organics are fine tou.</li>
<li>Having plenty organics and above is ideal, non bonus or malus doees the job tou.</li>
<li>Not be a waterworld for point 2, water worlds cant exploit &quot;Soil Nanites&quot; for obvious reasons.</li>
<li>Be in a system with atleast one barren and a planet with extream heat, this allows for the use of another 3 very useful items later one.</li>
<li>And lastly it should not be over 150% Hazard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good contenders for this are (these are in order top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
<li>Terran</li>
<li>Terran Eccentric</li>
<li>Jungle</li>
<li>Tundra if ur willing to spend storypoints on off-setting the -1 condition on farms</li>
<li>Arid if ur willing to spend storypoints on off-setting the -1 condition  on farms</li>
</ul>

<p>Should u play with Unknown Skies and in my humble opinion u should this extends to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continent</li>
<li>Archipelago</li>
<li>Lifeless</li>
<li>Lifeless Arid if ur willing to spend storypoints on off-setting the -1 condition on farms</li>
<li>Magnetic</li>
</ul>

<p>After finding a candidat ur happy with colonize it. After 15 Days buy Farming. If u have Soil Nanites install it for a +2 Boost. Now u wanna increase Access, this improves ur exports sales. Access gains are always cumulative. Options for this include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrading to a Megaport = +30% Access</li>
<li>Using story points on ur port = +20% Access</li>
<li>Building a waystation, this has the added bonus that u can now draw supply, fuel and crew.Normal prices are added to ur end of month report = +10% Access</li>
<li>Using story points on ur waystation = +20% Access</li>
<li>Installing  an alpha core on ur port = +20% Access</li>
<li>Installing a port item called  fullerene spool (caution rare) = +30% Access</li>
<li>Aplha Core Admin</li>
<li>Free Port</li>
<li>Space Elevator ( Unkown Skies only) = +50% Access</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an exsample how high access makes a fresh colony viable</p>

<p><a href="https://prnt.sc/26ufyvn">https://prnt.sc/26ufyvn</a></p>

<p><a href="https://prnt.sc/26ufzql">https://prnt.sc/26ufzql</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xk0j51hgveh81.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b13fc64ab18a8a772e52552c1ba97fa3066440bb">I got extreamly lucky, the system has a good terran and extreme heat barren.Good for big fleets, fuel, metal procutionand there even a trash planet for orbital works, aswell as a cryosleeper directly in system.</a></p>

<p>After getting up and running ur next priority is increasing stability while having ur free port open.This can be done by all the defense structures with increasing benefits the more u build them up.High stability with a free port and without it can make up to 60k diff in sales.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Next thing to get is mining for organics and light industry. The later producing common and luxery goods and if u have a free port also drugs. a  <a href="https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/Biofactory_Embryo">Biofactory Embryo</a>  will increase its production by +2 and is HIGHLY rec. since without its its only moderatly profitable.</p>

<p>A Size 6 Colony without  Commerce can pull up to 220k+ on 200% Access, not using the max possible access yet and without commerce, using story point upgrades in port, way station and farming aswell as port and farming alpha cores.</p>

<p>Burn bright commander.</p>

I thought it would be a good idea to make a big thread where everyone new to the game can come to ask questions and find answers.</p>

<p>So if are you stuck on a piece of game mechanics, want to know the best way to do a particular thing or are generally confused about how the game works, here is the place to ask your questions!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: People are messaging me directly, but I&#39;m still actively responding to questions in this thread. Don&#39;t be afraid to post here</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Video Tutorial</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/callMeEzekiel">/u/callMeEzekiel</a> has put together a video tutorial for new players that can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/dghcos/most_of_the_starsector_tutorials_on_youtube_are/">here</a>. It&#39;s a good primer on all the things you need to know when first starting out.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Where can I read more about the ships / weapons etc that are in the game?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/Starsector_Wiki">Starsector Wiki</a> has you covered. In addition to a lot of information about the game&#39;s mechanics it&#39;s got a lot of information about what <a href="https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ships">Ships</a>, <a href="https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Weapons">Weapons</a> and <a href="https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Hullmods">Hullmods</a> exist in the game. </p>

<p>The in-game Codex is also a very useful resource.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the thoughts behind the design of the game, check out the <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/blog/">Dev Blog</a></p>

<p><strong>Where can I go to talk to people about this game?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Where can I find mods?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?board=8.0">Mod Forum</a> has everything your heart desires.</p>

<p><strong>What mods are recommended?</strong></p>

<p>An index of mods can be found <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=177.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>For quality of life mods, consider <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13394.0">SpeedUp</a>, <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=7921.0">Leading Pip</a> and <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=7526.0">Common Radar</a>. <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=10399.0">Combat Chatter</a> can add some flavour to battles, while <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=12041.0">Unknown Skies</a> and <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=9446.0">Upgraded Rotary Weapons</a> polish the graphics. These will improve your gameplay experience without changing the underlying mechanics of the game.</p>

<p>For those interested in more of a 4X experience, consider installing <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=9175.0">Nexerelin</a>, which allows faction to capture other faction&#39;s colonies and bases.</p>

<p><strong>====== Mods ======</strong></p>

<p>A list of high-quality mods can be found at the <a href="http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=177.0">Mod Index</a> on the official forums. The Mods subforum contains many threads with other mods not on this list that you might be interested in.</p>

<p>For <strong>quality of life mods</strong>, consider <em>Combat Chatter</em>, <em>SpeedUp</em>, <em>Leading Pip</em> and <em>Common Radar</em>. New players might also want to run <em>New Beginnings</em> as it makes it easier to recover from getting your fleet completely wiped.</p>

<p>For those interested in more of a <strong>4X</strong> experience, consider installing the <em>Nexerelin</em> or <em>Vayra&#39;s Sector</em> megamods, which drastically change the campaign-level gameplay. It is recommended to play vanilla first until you have built up a sizeable empire, as these mods introduce new systems that might overwhelm a beginning player.</p>

<p><strong>If you plan to use a lot of mods, you should give <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/curjh8/psa_modded_starsector_needs_manual_ram_adjustment/">Starsector more RAM to work with</a>.</strong></p>

I was able to find info across many different posts that helped me succeed, and am consolidating here for the benefit of new players who want a sustainable colony without hordes of expedition fleets chaining them to their colony.</p>

<p><strong>When to Colonising</strong><br/>
When you have 1 year of Academy stipend remaining, at least 3 tanky combat cruisers and other ships (destroyers, fire support, carriers) and 1 million credits, to be supplemented with bounty income as the colony grows. 2 million if you babysit your colony and do minimal bounties. You should have already obtained blueprints for your colony stations &amp; fleet through exploring. Keep any nanoforges &amp; Synchrotrons, AI cores you can turn-in to Tri-tachyon for 3x sale value for credits. You can easily obtain new cores from farming Remnant in late game.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Colonise</strong><br/>
A system with at least 2-3 &lt;150% hazard worlds, preferably with ores, farmland and volatiles on separate worlds. Systems with yellow/orange stars, with moons orbiting a gas giant are ideal as it keeps the planets close together for common defence. Should have stable points for stability bonus. Systems should be within 20 Light-Years of core systems for accessibility bonus and for your own sanity - less time running to the fringes.</p>

<p><strong>How to Colonise</strong><br/>
Ready 1000 crew, 200 supplies, 100 machinery and click the colonise button. Make sure you have enough crew &amp; supplies afterwards to keep your fleet operational.</p>

<p><strong>Building Guide - Phase 1</strong><br/>
150,000 credits for first industry (farming OR mining - preferably with ores &amp; transplutonics).<br/>
Spaceport is automatically built<br/>
250,000 credits for Tier 1 Orbital Station (space &amp; ground defence, stability)<br/>
250,000 credits for Patrol HQ (stability)<br/>
100,000 credits for growth incentives<br/>
Only Pirates will attack you at this stage, you may need to babysit until you have Tier 2 upgrades.<br/>
Colony should be size 4 by now<br/>
500,000 credits for Tier 2 Orbital Station Upgrade<br/>
500,000 credits for Tier 2 Patrol HQ Upgrade to Military Base (takes up 2nd industry slot).<br/>
Your colony is now able to fend off pirates on its own; high reputation with Independents also help as scavenger fleets will hang around your colony to help defend.</p>

<p>You may choose to build a waystation at any time so you can restock your fleet<br/>
Stability should be at 10 with this set-up, giving you maximum bonuses.<br/>
Your colony should be making at least 20,000 credits per month during this initial growth phase - never in the red.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong><br/>
Start a 2nd colony with farming or mining, whichever you didn&#39;t build<br/>
Similar to above build order, but keep patrol HQ as it doesn&#39;t consume an industry slot<br/>
Build a Commerce building so you can sell loot - Optional but for convenience (uses an industry slot). I like to put this on a 3rd colony so my 2 main colonies can focus on profitable industries.<br/>
Upgrade both spaceports to Megaport for growth bonuses for 300,000 each.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3</strong><br/>
Your 1st colony should be hitting Size 5, capturing more market share and potentially attracting expeditions from jealous factions. Build a heavy industry, add on a pristine nanoforge. This will up the quality of your fleets, and size 5 colony will spawn sizable fleets. Upgrade military base to High Command for 150,000 credits so heavy defence fleets spawn. Since you&#39;re going to be raided anyway, build Refining on the other colony so your mined ores can be refined and the metals can be sent to your industry to build ships - reduces upkeep.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4</strong><br/>
Your colonies can now defend themselves and are making you anywhere from 50,000 - 400,000 credits per month after deducting upkeep, and you can figure out what to do from here at your own pace - peaceful star nation with a big stick, or the next star empire to unite the sector through fire &amp; fury.</p>

<p>Turning on free-port or using AI cores will greatly accelerate your colony growth and make you tons of money, but be prepared to go to war with the entire sector.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Early Expeditions</strong><br/>
Do not build tech-mining, fuel production, turn on free-port or use AI cores. Basically follow the above guide. If your colony attracts an expedition before Phase 1 is complete, just pay off the expedition with 100,000 credits (Intel - Colony Threats - Expedition - Avert Expedition Option)</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Luddic Path Cells</strong><br/>
This is the reason to build across 2 separate colonies. Cells spawn because Technology/Industrial activities generate interest. The magic number to avoid is 7 per planet.<br/>
Farming (0) + Heavy Industry (2) + Pristine Nanoforge (4) = 6 &lt; 7<br/>
Mining (1) + Refining (2) + Fuel Production (2) = 5 &lt; 7<br/>
Tech-mining, Orbital Works Upgrade, Synchrotrons, AI Cores also generate interest</p>

<p><strong>Good Relations with Factions</strong><br/>
Since your colony is strong and wiping out expeditions, you&#39;ll lose 5 relations per destroyed expedition. Just make it back by destroying pirate fleets in the core systems (when bounty is active) or going after bases &amp; bounties (when bounty is active), so your colony trade fleets can go get you more money.</p>

<p><strong>Colony Skills or Administrators</strong><br/>
Plan to have at least Planetary Operations 3 (under leadership) for 2 bonus stability. Optional but recommended to get the other colony skills, or get a 2-skill administrator. If you hire them before the colony starts, you only pay 10% of their salary (2500 credits per month for the 2-skill administrator).</p>

<p>Hope this guide is useful and takes out all the guesswork for newbies!</p>
