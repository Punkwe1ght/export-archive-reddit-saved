<p>I already understood and did what my daily driver needed.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s it....</p>

<p>TL;DR.... Chill.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t pass your car test after learning to drive and then say</p>

<pre><code>Right, I&#39;m going to learn to be a mechanic
</code></pre>

<p>to yourself..  </p>

<p>If you feel the need to be able to do something.... then learn <strong><em>that</em></strong> something...   </p>

<p>i.e. people don&#39;t become a mechanic if they only want to be able to change a buld or type, jump-start a flat battery or top up the blinker / coolant / windscreen wiper fluid without calling out a garage.... </p>

<p>They learn <em>those</em> bits... and generally only <em>when</em> they need to....</p>

<p>So, what do you want to do <em>now</em>?</p>

<button onclick="toggles(365)">View full post</button><div id="365" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry I am a noob and new to linux , what would be the lightest linux distro to install ( and easy to learn as well ) As I am trying to dual boot my gaming laptop so as to increase its battery life when in Linux as I have too much stuff installed on windows including games and other things which run in background which kill its battery backup.</p>

<p>I would like to use the linux just for basic work and online surfing so that I can get longer battery life and also learn more about Linux.</p>

<p>Also I am using Lenovo y540 if that matters.</p>

<h2>Assuming I forgot my root password, how fucked am I?</h2>

<p>Short version so you don&#39;t have to read all that stuff - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>At your grub menu press &quot;e&quot; to edit boot options.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll see a simple text edtor.  Find the line that starts with &quot;linux&quot; and at the end of that line add a space and then <code>init=/bin/bash</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hit F10 to exit the editor.  The machine will boot.</p></li>
<li><p>Remount your root filesystem read/write like this - <code>mount -o remount,rw /</code></p></li>
<li><p>Change root&#39;s password by running <code>passwd root</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Done and no live media required  :)</p>
