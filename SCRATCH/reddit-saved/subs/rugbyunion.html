<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys I honestly know next to nothing about Rugby, but what I do know is quite interesting and I want to become more of a fan. I live in America, so I don&#39;t get many televised games, though I would happily stream them if I knew how. I have apps on my phone for the other sports leagues I follow (NFL, MLB, NHL, KHL) so if there&#39;s something like that for Rugby I would be really interested. My main question, though, is how Rugby is organized? Is there a &quot;Major League&quot; like football and hockey and baseball, or is it a little more nebulous? What&#39;s a good league to follow? What are some good teams to follow/become a fan of?</p>
