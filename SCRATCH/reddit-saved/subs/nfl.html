<hr/>

<p>This is the first post in my beginners guide to basic NFL plays.</p>

<h1>Zone Read (Read Option)</h1>

<p>A simple running play, with two possible outcomes. Either a quarterback keeper, or a hand off the the running back off tackle. The quarterback makes his decision based on the actions of the backside defensive end. If the end goes after the RB, the QB keeps it. If the end stays and guards the QB, he hands it off. That is the ‘Read’ part of the zone read. The ‘Zone’ refers to the blocking scheme, which I plan to cover in a later portion of this series. Ideally, when this play is run, the defensive linemen and linebackers are all blocked except for the backside defensive end. Not blocking this end frees up another lineman to block, however, this allows the end complete access to the backfield, which is why this play requires the QB to make his read. </p>

<p>Here are the 3 plays I will be using to demonstrate the Zone Read</p>

<ul>
<li>Succesful handoff to RB <a href="http://gfycat.com/HorribleGlitteringBlueshark">Here</a></li>
<li>Successfull QB keeper <a href="http://gfycat.com/HappygoluckyBothDavidstiger">Here</a></li>
<li>Proper defensive containment <a href="http://gfycat.com/GleamingFloweryAchillestang">Here</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/VIpldff">Positional Responsibilities:</a> Yellow is offensive movements. Red is the free DE.</p>

<h1>Offensive Line:</h1>

<p>Typically, on a zone read, the offensive line immediately crashes down to the play side(the side the RB runs toward). They use a zone blocking scheme, which in its simplest terms means they just block whoever is in their way, instead of blocking a specific defender. Occasionally, a lineman may pull to the backside (quarterback side) to give the QB a blocker. This immediate crash to the play side is designed to draw the defense to stop the run on this side of the line. Biting too hard toward that side is what lets Kaepernick run these for 45 yards.</p>

<p><a href="http://gfycat.com/NeglectedHomelyAsianwaterbuffalo#?speed=.25">O line crashing down</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Notice each lineman’s first step is hard toward their left side and #50 is left unguarded. #50 is who the QB will read on this play</li>
</ul>

<p>Advanced offensive line:</p>

<p>&quot;I think using the term &quot;crashing down&quot; on zone gives the wrong idea, because to me that kind of makes it sound like they&#39;re downblocking as opposed to zone blocking.</p>

<p>While all the lineman are going the same way on zone, you&#39;re not looking to just hit the defender if he&#39;s in your way and drive him down. The linemen are looking to &#39;cover up&#39; the defender (being face to face with him), forcing him to widen out further and further if he wants to hold his gap.</p>

<p>This widening out creates the cutback lanes for the running back.</p>

<p>When there isn&#39;t a defensive lineman immediately in an offensive lineman&#39;s zone, they double team back-side to create more vertical push on the defensive lineman, while staying square and anticipating a linebacker flowing over and into their zone, at which point they get off the double and pick up the linebacker.&quot; - credit to <a href="/u/jaymun">/u/jaymun</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/2z4eiy/slug/cpfqup0">here</a> </p>

<h1>Running Back:</h1>

<p>The RB starts the play to the side of the QB and ½ to 1 yard back. When the ball is snapped, he runs into the ball just in front of the QB ready to receive the handoff. Unlike most running plays, he does not immediately grab the ball; he keeps his arms open, ready to have the ball taken away. Also unlike most plays, the RB is responsible for the handoff, since the QB’s focus is on the read. He ignores the free DE and focuses on finding a hole in the line to run through. If the ball is kept by the QB he then becomes another blocker. The RB always runs to the opposite side of the line as when he started.</p>

<h1>Quarterback:</h1>

<p>This is always a shotgun play. Pre snap, the QB must identify which defender will be unblocked, usually the DE, but can be an OLB as well. When the ball is snapped, the QB holds the ball in front of him for the RB and keeps his eyes focused on the DE. The DE will do one of two things:</p>

<p>He will dive in behind the line and attempt to tackle the RB while still in the backfield. If this happens the QB will pull the ball away from the RB and run around the DE.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gfycat.com/HappygoluckyBothDavidstiger">Full Play</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gfycat.com/TheseDeficientEwe#?speed=.5">QB Read</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/Xs9ojpw">Decision Moment</a> Blue shows defensive momentum, red shows Wilsons route</li>
<li>On this play, Justin Houston, while not diving after the RB, creates too much momentum in that direction, and is unable to turn around and catch Wilson. Notice how much he has to turn his hips to follow the QB.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DE can also stay on the edge and attempt to contain/tackle the QB; if this happens the QB will let the RB take the ball and fake a run to the edge.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gfycat.com/HorribleGlitteringBlueshark">Full Play</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/a/QLJTF">Album</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/tBcKCwY">Decision Point</a></li>
<li>As you can see in this series of images, the free DE goes hard at the QB and has to turn all the way around to chase the RB. He does end up making the tackle, but at 5 yards past the line. At the decision point, Wilson sees the DE coming down, and another defender behind him, then hands it off.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Defense</h1>

<p>A successful defensive counter to the zone read requires several elements. Generally, the defense is more successful at stopping the running back, which means it is typically better for the DE to commit to the QB. This requires a safety to make the tackle, which will usually happen 5-7 yards out, or for a linebacker to get around his block to make the play. When the DE commits to the RB is typically when the huge runs get broken, as this can put the QB 1 on 1 with either a corner or a safety. <a href="http://gfycat.com/DesertedRipeInchworm">This</a> attempt by Kaepernick is stuffed because Houston, as in the other gif, moves to the RB but stays neutral enough to chase Kap into a cornerback who shed his block easily, as shown <a href="http://gfycat.com/YearlyGregariousGalah">Here</a> and <a href="http://gfycat.com/GleamingFloweryAchillestang">Here</a></p>

<ul>
<li>In the birds eye view, take note of the corner covering the slot position. He drops into coverage, sheds his block, and moves up to make the play</li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/dGmHE4r">Decision Point</a> Notice how much #50 is leaned towards the line. That makes it very difficult to turn around quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of an incorrect read:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gfycat.com/IdolizedSillyHoneybadger">Full Play</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gfycat.com/CreativeGraveCob">Alternate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/J9H8f6P">Decision Point</a> Notice #51, has his hips completely underneath him with feet spread and ready to move either direction.</li>
<li>Bruce Irvin takes a couple shuffle steps to the inside, before slowing down and watching Stanton. That pause is enough time for the RB to gain ground and the ball should have been handed off. Stanton however sees the first couple steps inside and pulls the ball. All the while Irvin has him completely contained.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since 2012, the zone read has seen increasing use by nearly every team in the NFL from around 5% of all running plays, to 9% in 2014</li>
<li>However, the average yards per attempt has decreased in that same time frame, from around 8, to 4.6</li>
<li>the Zone Read is more successful than the average run. With an average of 4.6 yds/attempt across the NFL, versus 4.1 for other run plays.</li>
<li>The Dolphins had the most Zone Read plays in 2014, averaging 4.9 yds/a. Seahawks had the second most plays as well as the most touchdowns via the Zone Read</li>
</ul>

<h1>Discussion Questions:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Houston takes the same attack in both an offense success and defense success play. How did each play have such different results?</li>
<li>All these plays were ran with a TE and 3 WRs. Do you think it would be more effective out of a different formation?</li>
<li>Kaepernick had a pulling TE as a lead blocker. Was this helpful, hurtful, or did it make no difference?</li>
<li>Houston(50) got credit for a tackle on Kaepernick. Is this deserved? Or should it have gone to a different player?</li>
<li>Most of these plays were against a nickel defense. Would a stacked box (4-4, 5-2) make a zone read more or less effective?</li>
<li>Does the zone read require a smart quarterback? An agile quarterback?</li>
<li>Does the zone read become more or less effective on a team that plays more out of the shotgun (Eagles) versus one that plays mostly from under center (Patriots)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know how you think this series could be improved, other topics I should cover etc. Credit to <a href="/u/gipsysafety">/u/gipsysafety</a> for editing help.</p>

<p>Edit: one thing I forgot to mention. This is first and foremost a running play for the running back. The QB keeper is the second option for a specific circumstance. If it is in any way ambiguous it should always be handed off. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been a lot of talk recently about Jarryd Hayne and his transition to the NFL. However, he&#39;s not the only Australian import to the US&#39; number one sport. Punters Darren Bennett, Sav Rocca and Ben Graham all started their careers playing the highest form of Australian Football.</p>

<p>The AFL (Australian Football League) is Australia&#39;s premier sporting competition. Australian Football is not rugby. In fact it&#39;s not really like any other sport. It has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wpn9hYOmk">the hard hits of the NFL</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldL7ADjQkXY">the athleticism</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZArY0CZ6AY">high scoring of the NBA</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPqoirbtsqw">free flowing nature of soccer</a>.</p>

<p>The first game of the season will be played on Thursday at 4:20am (EDT) between the Carlton Blues and the Richmond Tigers. Now that&#39;s incredibly early but the games played on Saturday, Sunday and Monday are at considerably better times for US viewing (the massive rivalry match between Harthorn and Geelong will be on at 1:20 am on the 6th of April... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ-Zhz6nb2c">here&#39;s a sample of what you&#39;re in for</a>.</p>

<p>This year is going to be a huge one for the AFL. The Hawthorn Hawks are attempting to pull off a championship three-peat. The Sydney Swans want to bounce back after being dominant for all of last season only to be flogged in the Grand Final. Expansion team the Gold Coast Suns and their captain Gary Ablett Jnr (the best player in the league and arguably the greatest player of all time) are pushing for their first finals birth. No supporter really knows how their 
team is going to perform this year. And that&#39;s incredibly exciting.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in getting involved there&#39;s an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/">AFL subreddit</a>, <a href="http://www.afl.com.au/">the official AFL website</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtmu-1kMFZw">this great instructional video</a> (it&#39;s a few years old now but still worth the watch). </p>

<p>So come get around it! Don&#39;t jump on the Hawthorn bandwagon unless you&#39;re a Patriots fan. Don&#39;t be a Collingwood Magpies supporter unless you root for the Cowboys. If you&#39;re struggling to pick a team I&#39;d suggest giving the Greater Western Sydney Giants a try. They&#39;re the youngest team, they have recruited exceptionally well and they&#39;ll be pushing for a top 8 spot this season... everyone loves an underdog story!</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2LnCMzlv5k">GO SWANS</a></p>

<h2>Stefon Diggs' rookie debut (Gifs and analysis)</h2>

<div id="3nl2qo" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Tl;dr:  If you watch one play, watch Diggs&#39; corner route make Talib miss <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/CapitalCheapBlackrussianterrier">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Going into the 2015 draft, Stefon Diggs was a curious prospect: he showed <em>lots</em> of flash, with quick-twitch routes, subtle moves, ability to contest jump balls and consistently racked up monster gains after the catch.  <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2414484-why-marylands-stefon-diggs-could-be-the-biggest-wr-steal-of-the-2015-nfl-draft">He was maybe the best WR prospect coming out of high school</a>, but chose his home college Maryland over better teams.  He looked good at Maryland, but wasn&#39;t being tested against college&#39;s best secondaries, and given Maryland&#39;s quarterback circus, his production didn&#39;t jump off a stat line.  He also struggled with injuries quite a bit, and he wasn&#39;t very physical.  His combine performance was good (4.46 40) but not great, and the question marks caused him to fall to the Vikings in the early fifth round.</p>

<p>At training camp, Diggs <a href="http://www.testudotimes.com/2015/7/29/9067461/stefon-diggs-minnesota-vikings-nfl">stole the show</a>.  He had a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/precision-is-hallmark-for-vikings-rookie-receiver-diggs/320995891/">great attitude</a> (a breath of fresh air after Patterson&#39;s struggles), and had some <a href="http://www.vikings.com/media-vault/videos/WR-Stefon-Diggs-Highlights/707eb25c-fdc0-4203-ac4b-38f4ea471cf4">highlight-reel catches and routes</a>.</p>

<p>When an injury to WR2 Charles Johnson and slot receiver Jarius Wright allowed Diggs to be the next man up, Diggs stepped up.  He was Teddy&#39;s favorite target and the team&#39;s leading receiver, accruing ten targets for six catches for 87 yards.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking down every target</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>His <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/DeliciousOrangeKillerwhale">first NFL reception</a> showed that this offense likes his playmaker potential, with a short WR screen trusting Diggs to make a play in space.  Unfortunately, it broke down due to bad blocking from Ellison and Wallace, and Denver was all over Diggs.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs got his second NFL reception two plays later on a <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/PeacefulAmusedGrosbeak">quick slant</a>.  Diggs got good separation off Roby on a solid route but Teddy threw the pass slightly behind Diggs to turn what should have been a solid gain into a just-barely third-down conversion on a contested catch (which Diggs had no trouble holding on to).</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs&#39; third reception was one for the highlight reels: Teddy Bridgewater escapes a collapsing pocket and, with Von Miller tackling him from behind, <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/DecentGiganticCoot">delivers a bullet</a> to Diggs for 25 yards to convert third down and then some.  Diggs again <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/FatSandyDugong">holds on to the ball</a> despite a big tackle from Roby.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs fourth target was a rookie mistake--Teddy delivers a quick WR screen (again showing how Norv likes Diggs&#39; playmaking potential), but despite Teddy hitting him between the numbers, Diggs <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/HeavyRareDogwoodtwigborer">bobbles and drops the pass</a>.  Ultimately not the worst thing, considering how the blocking on this play broke down, but Diggs will need to work on his catching.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs next catch showed both the good <em>and</em> the bad--Diggs runs a good post route and gets <em>just</em> enough room for Teddy to deliver a <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/PastTepidInchworm">beautiful pass</a> that Diggs <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/FriendlyBitesizedDipper">extends up</a> to bring down for 25 yards, but then Darian Stewart makes a great play and <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/PositiveMasculineBrownbutterfly">punches the ball out</a>.  Luckily Diggs was aware enough to recover his own fumble.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs&#39; next target is the very next play on a quick slant, but this time Roby is ready and <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/HeartyCriminalAfricanelephant">deflects the pass</a>, preventing another reception from the rookie.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs&#39; next target is <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/LinearHiddenAsp">overthrown</a>.  The Broncos have now responded to Diggs being targeted so frequently by bringing Chris Harris to cover him--this pass shows a noticeable improvement in coverage.  It&#39;s a <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/CourageousFoolishApatosaur">good corner route</a> and it shows that Teddy trusts Diggs&#39; ability to reach up and bring down the ball, but Teddy has to make these redzone throws.</p></li>
<li><p>Teddy immediately tries Diggs again, but Roby has him well covered and the over-the-shoulder touchdown pass is just <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/DaringLimpingEnglishpointer">barely overthrown</a>.  Great redzone coverage from the league&#39;s best defense keeps the Vikings to a field goal on this long drive.</p></li>
<li><p>Diggs&#39; next target again puts him in space to make a play on a <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/UnpleasantPhysicalIrishwaterspaniel">quick curl route</a>, but Roby makes a great play and punches the ball out.  Diggs reacts quickly, again recovering his own fumble, but he has to protect the ball better.</p></li>
<li><p>Luckily, Diggs redeems himself with his last catch, as he runs a <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/RemorsefulCharmingCoqui">beautiful post route and sideline catch</a> to convert on 1st-and-20.  One of the biggest highlights of the game, Diggs makes Talib (an elite corner) <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/CapitalCheapBlackrussianterrier">miss big with a subtle cut inside</a> to fake the post and then cut to the sideline to get as much space as anyone will ever get on Talib.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>, Diggs showed a <em>lot</em> of promise and a lot of room for improvement.  His route running is phenomenal for a rookie, and his ability to extend himself and bring down jump balls expands his catch radius and makes him open even when he&#39;s not open.  But he needs to work on his hands, with two dropped passes, and he absolutely needs to protect the ball better, given his two fumbles (credit to Denver, however, they did a great job forcing the fumbles).  Luckily, he has a good attitude and plenty of time to improve.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Route Tree is essentially a breakdown of every route that a wide receiver can run. There are others, but almost all are simply a variation or combination of routes shown in the tree. The tree shown <a href="http://imgur.com/a/itBxH">here</a> is the most basic version. Different teams may have more complicated trees or different numbering systems, but this version is fairly universal.</p>

<p>There are nine basic routes. Seven of them break at approximately 12-15 yards, the other two break almost immediately, or after one step. As you can see in the graphic, odd numbered routes break to the outside, and even numbered routes break to the inside.</p>

<p>Lets look at this applied to a real <a href="http://imgur.com/a/6ZUsn">game</a>.</p>

<p>This receiver can run 9 different routes all over the field, and is facing what appears to be man-on-man coverage. That is a very difficult thing to defend. In fact, it would be impossible to defend if that were true for every receiver. In that same image, if you look at the receiver at the top of the image, he is in ‘plus’ splits, outside the numbers. His route tree is much more limited, shown <a href="http://imgur.com/a/AmIp8">here</a>.</p>

<p>Because the receiver is so close to the sideline, he is unable to run a corner or an out route; because he is lined up outside of the cornerback, he is unable to run any of the inside routes, leaving him with only a comeback route or a go route. In order to open up the rest of the route tree, he has to break inside with his first steps, in order to get to the inside of the cornerback. If he does this, however, he loses all the outside routes of the route tree, as shown <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WeWyX">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is what makes the route tree so important to understand. Just based on where the receiver is, the cornerback can immediately eliminate 3 of the 9 possible routes. Once he sees the receiver’s first step, he can possibly eliminate another 4 routes. </p>

<p>It is possible for receivers to go through the cornerback. That outside receiver absolutely can break inside for a dig route, or take an inside release then break into a corner route. It is just much more difficult because he has to get around the cornerback. In fact, in the play from the images above, both outside receivers attempts to run their routes through the cornerbacks. <a href="https://gfycat.com/InexperiencedFlatChuckwalla">Here</a>. Look how much more time and effort he takes getting into his route, compared to the inside receiver who takes an outside release and runs a corner route.
Note how much the outside receivers have to fight the cornerbacks to complete their routes, while the inside receiver just runs. Also note how much space was gained by the inside receiver. This is why those routes can be effectively dismissed at the outset. They can still happen, but having to go through the cornerback takes away the surprise and allows defenders the time to adjust.</p>

<h1>Applied Learning</h1>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/ZEBAL">Here</a> is a pre-snap image of another play. Try to figure out what routes the three receivers are running.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/TastyAbleArcticwolf">Here</a> is a gif of the first few seconds of the play at half speed. Now what routes are the receivers running? </p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/QuickAgileBobcat">Here</a> is the whole play at full speed. </p>

<p>Were you correct? </p>

<p>Let’s walk through the process.
Immediately we know we have two receivers in plus splits and one in the slot. We have looked at all these possibilities earlier, so we know the possible routes look something like <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1cnih">this</a>.</p>

<p>Once we see the first few seconds, we know the outside receivers both take an outside release. Which means we can eliminate all the inside routes. The slot receiver continues running upfield which eliminates the drag and slant routes. The possible routes at this point look like <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IwUGk">this</a>.</p>

<p>After this point, we won’t know what routes are being run until the receivers make their breaks. It turns out the outside receivers both run comeback routes, and the inside receiver runs a dig. It is straightforward <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/31fc75/beginner_series_part_4_guide_to_horizontal/">horizontal stretch</a> play against a man-to-man defense.</p>

<p>This was an incredibly basic overview of the route tree. There are a number of routes which don’t appear on the tree, and things get even more complicated when you introduce combinations such as the bunch formation, or option routes. The basics introduced here can be seen in every NFL game, and are the roots of all the more complex route trees.</p>

<h1>Discussion Questions:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is the inside/outside release such an important concept within the route tree?
What are some routes you know of that aren’t included here? Why do you think they aren’t included?</p></li>
<li><p>In the step-by-step play shown above, the safety #29 (covering the slot receiver) gives a large cushion to the receiver he is covering and breaks very late to cover the route. Do you think the safety made a mistake? Was the receiver open? This receiver had much more space than those on the outside, why did the quarterback not throw to him?</p></li>
<li><p>How does being a ‘good route runner’ relate to a receiver’s use of the route tree?</p></li>
<li><p>The plays shown here were against man-to-man defense, how would the effects be different against a zone?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you think the route tree relates to a quarterback taking a 3/5/7 step drop?</p></li>
<li><p>If a receiver in Plus splits loses over half the route tree, why is it such a common formation?</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Ravens WR Sammy Watkins: “In this league, everybody is pretty much banged up. I don’t want to speak for him and whatever he’s going through with the contracts. But for me, you got a chance to do something special. He can will this team to a SuperBowl. I don’t think he’s thinking about it that way“</h2>

<p>I was out 2 months and wasn&#39;t the same for at least 3 months. </p>

<p>You&#39;re knee doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;toughing out&quot; pain. Your knee literally doesn&#39;t work properly. You can&#39;t put weight on your knee to stop and cut, which is a HUGE part of Jackson&#39;s game. </p>

<p>I know fans and the Ravens are wanting him back for a shot a superbowl, but if he tried to play right now, they won&#39;t see Lamar Jackson. They&#39;re gonna see a decoy. He literally can&#39;t do what he&#39;s accustomed to doing for a few more weeks at least. He only got injured a month ago. Fans who are giving him shit have never had this injury</p>
