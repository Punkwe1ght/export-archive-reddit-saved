<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><pre><code>1 cup Yellow Mustard  (sometimes I use brown, sometime 50/50) 
1/2 cup Sugar (I use raw)
1/2 cup Cider vinegar (have played around with using plain white as well) 
1/4 cup Brown sugar, light
2 Tbsp Chili powder
1 tsp Pepper
1 tsp White pepper (take this out to really cut the heat)
1 tsp Cayenne pepper (I most often use Chipotle here)
1 tablespoon Hot sauce (I use Choulula, the wooden topped bottle)
1 tsp Soy sauce, dark
2 Tbsp Butter
1-2 Cups water depending

Combine all ingredients, except soy sauce and butter, add the WATER last to your desired thickness.  
Simmer for 10 minutes.  (careful here, I have at least once made it &quot;Chewy&quot; by overcooking the sugars).
Remove from heat and add butter and soy sauce.

I get complaints that the &quot;By the book&quot; is to hot for the kids so I typically try and skimp on the peppers and hot sauce.

<p>I&#39;ve converted plenty of &quot;eww mustard on BBQ&quot; pleebes over the years with this one. Including a host of Yankees that now ALWAYS have a jar of this stuff ready in their fridge.</p>
