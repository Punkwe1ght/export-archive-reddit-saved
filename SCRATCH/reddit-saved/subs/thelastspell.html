<h2>Gold Mines: An Updated Guide</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/someitoj </span><span class = "numcomments">13 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastspell/comments/ykij0p/gold_mines_an_updated_guide/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(371)">View full post</button><div id="371" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some time ago, I did a guide on gold mines, how long it took for them to pay off, which upgrades to get, what build orders you could realisticly take with them...</p>

<p>But since then, Gold Mines have been <strong>completely overhauled</strong> to be much more simple.</p>

<p>I will only be looking at the <strong>passive production</strong> of gold mines here. Obviously, when you are spending workers on the mines, it makes them even more efficient.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th align="left"></th>
<th align="left">Cost</th>
<th align="left">Income per night</th>
<th align="left">Days till Break-even</th>

</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Base</td>
<td align="left">60 gold</td>
<td align="left">+25 gold</td>
<td align="left">2,4</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">Upgrade</td>
<td align="left">60 gold</td>
<td align="left">+15 gold</td>
<td align="left">4</td>

<td align="left"><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="left"><strong>120 gold</strong></td>
<td align="left"><strong>+40 gold</strong></td>
<td align="left"><strong>3</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>That is a lot less to consider then before. There used to be 3 upgrades, with a much steeper initial cost and a much more drastic impact.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be looking at 2 scenario&#39;s:</p>

<ol>
<li>You invest in builders day 1 and go for 3 upgraded gold mines on day 2</li>
<li>You invest in 3 un-upgraded gold mines on day 1 and upgrade them on night 2</li>
</ol>

<p>These are both possible on Glenwald where I tested them, given that you <em>sell a bunch of equipment your heroes start with and your first 2 night rewards.</em> I like to just take all the equipment from my ranger and mage, they don&#39;t tend to get hit anyway. </p>

<p>Due to the way the new mines work now, there is little downside to just waiting an extra turn to upgrade them, so you don&#39;t have to put yourself at risk. </p>

<p>Note that this strategy is easier to pull of if you have meta upgrades like <em>&#39;starting heroes have helmets&#39;, &#39;starting heroes have consumables&#39;, &#39;starting heroes have a chance to start with higher quality gear&#39; and &#39;starting heries have a chance ti start with higher rarity gear&#39;</em> as these upgrades all increase the gold value heroes carry on them. Omens like the scavenger or wealth omens also help.</p>

<p>I also include graph lines for single mines, upgraded and un-upgraded.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ilgxjhrxmlx91.png?width=3212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=453d7079587aa6bb10f16d9ceacea88cfdc3d3e7">https://preview.redd.it/ilgxjhrxmlx91.png?width=3212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=453d7079587aa6bb10f16d9ceacea88cfdc3d3e7</a></p>

<p>As you can see, for 3 fully upgraded gold mines, it takes only 4 days to pay themselves off. Interestingly, there is barely any upside to building 3 gold mines day 1 and upgrading them day 2.</p>

<p>There is not alot to say about the new mines. Their value is fairly easy to evaluate. Generally, if you have the funds early on, investing just doesn&#39;t have a downside anymore. The strategy of selling all your gear is also just not necessary anymore. </p>

<p><strong>For context</strong>, the old mines used to be the opposite of the current mines: the base form was useless (only producing 10 gold) but the upgrades made them multiplicatively better (each upgrade generally more than doubled the gold output). So getting one mine fully upgraded  as early as possible was worth selling equipment over because it reduced the overall pay-off time significantly.</p>

<p>Now the upgrade is just a worse version of building an additional mine. Though upgrading does not require space in your city. I like it.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that with the gold mine changes, production buildings and the shop were overhauled, so the use for gold has also changed accordingly. The strategy to get gear used to be either gold mines + shop OR only production buildings. Now, gold mines support the building of production buildings.</p>

<p>I do feel like I&#39;ve lost the choice to go for gold mines now though. Their investment is small and their pay-off is solid. Get them early to kickstart your economy. You are crippling your late game if you ignore them. <strong>But</strong>, since temples and manawells now also provide a daily bonus, I could see an argument that you are trading some permanent stats you&#39;d get if you build these first. I just currently think the bonusses are too small to consider it a big trade-off.</p>

<h2>Beginner's Guide to Crush Night 12 (on Normal)</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Fyrizok </span><span class = "numcomments">12 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastspell/comments/on309i/beginners_guide_to_crush_night_12_on_normal/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(605)">View full post</button><div id="605" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys (my first reddit post) - I decided to put this guide together because I saw a lot of people struggling in the beginning to beat Night 12 on normal. Be warned this is a <strong><em>LONG</em></strong> post. (TLDR at the bottom)</p>

<p>This is not an intro for new players, I assume you have a basic understanding of game mechanics and have done a few runs. If something seems obvious for you it may not be for someone else, this is to get everyone on the same page. I will also try to keep this as spoiler free as possible because Night 12  was fun and surprising (and stressful) the first time I did it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this out of the way, in the beginning The Last Spell is <strong><em>HARD</em></strong> for some and <strong><em>IMPOSSIBLE</em></strong> for most (like me) without Meta upgrades. However, there are tons of Meta upgrades that can and will make you significantly stronger (sometimes overpowered). I&#39;m currently on my 8th run about to finish Night 12 on Apocalypse 2, so I haven&#39;t used / unlocked everything.</p>

<h1>Meta Upgrades:</h1>

<p><strong>Tainted Essence (TE)</strong></p>

<p>I won&#39;t go into detail listing/ranking everything, other people have done that (like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/defmetalTTV/">u/defmetalTTV</a>). This is more to get you to prioritize upgrades. When buying Meta upgrades with TE I want you to ask yourself 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will I use this?</li>
<li>How often will I use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you answered &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;a lot&quot; then you should make it a priority to buy it. There are some obvious upgrade choices and ultimately you will unlock them all, but the order is important for you in the beginning:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actions points (AP) - this one is obvious, you want &#39;em, you need &#39;em, ASAP and as many as you can get</li>
<li>Armor Maker / Wealthy Haven - like AP, you need it, just get it</li>
<li>Additional Mage(s) - this is one of preference, I have 3 mages but after a certain point nothing ever gets close enough to your circle</li>
<li>Mixed Weapon Sets - I think everyone should explore the different weapon types to fit their play style</li>
<li>Various More Weapons (Swords, Shortbow, etc.) - once you&#39;ve locked in your favorites, get more of them! Not only will they fill the loot pool in your favor they&#39;ll also come with bonus stats.</li>
<li>Various Armor Sets - honestly, unless you&#39;re on the wiki you will have no clue what these do. So much like weapons, think about what armor types you use (Heavy, Medium, Light) and go from there</li>
<li>Items Production X - focus on these when you start using Equipment Production buildings, its better loot passively</li>
<li>Hero Generation/Stat/Building/Feature Unlocks (More Mana, Ballista, etc.) - again, based on preference/play style</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blessings</strong></p>

<p>These are purely based on what you have already unlocked and you&#39;ll eventually get them all so I won&#39;t spend a lot of time here. Just treat it like TE, prioritize your play style, get the Gold Mine and Inn. You can always do farming runs to unlock them.</p>

<h1>Hero Stats:</h1>

<p>Now we get to the meat of the game and my favorite part - building out your Heroes. There are huge number of different ways to build your character but <strong><em>the purpose of this section is to get them viable</em></strong>. This won&#39;t make you a min/maxing god but your characters will at least pass a cursory glance.</p>

<p>There are 3 main types of Hero builds  as dictated by the game - Physical, Magic, and Ranged. I personally always run at least one of each, although I know the community currently prefers Ranged (and I don&#39;t blame them). For all 3 types you&#39;ll <strong><em>generally</em></strong> want to focus on the below no matter what their build: (again not covering every stat)</p>

<p><strong>Offense</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Damage, Damage, and MORE Damage - obvious, I know, but <strong><em>your goal is to have enough damage to kill most enemies the first time, every time</em></strong><em>.</em> You&#39;ll want both your main stat damage type (Physical, Magic, Ranged) and the secondary stat Damage, which is a multiplier. I recommend a minimum of 30% main stat and 10% secondary stat. Starting out, you&#39;ll usually have 3 or 4 times the main stat compared to the secondary stat. (i.e. 40% Ranged and 10% Damage)</li>
<li>Poison - this is an optional damage stat which I have come to like. I don&#39;t love it but it compliments Magic builds nicely and ignores armor but definitely requires more management of mobs.</li>
<li>Crit / Crit Power - if you deal direct damage (i.e. not poison) you will generally want this to a certain point. This is a damage multiplier so it&#39;s a good idea to get your crit chance to 25-50% depending on your Crit Power.  I personally always go crit builds because of Mana Collector, and try to maintain 40-50% crit chance and 250-300% crit power (not including perks).</li>
<li>Action Points (AP) - this one is difficult to judge and you should decide on a case by case basis, usually worth it 70% of the time. This is because gaining AP usually comes at the expense of other stats (typically Damage or XP). I recommend 6-8 AP, but most of my characters have 6 (I unlocked the last AP upgrade this morning, so my next run will have 7 base).</li>
<li>Accuracy - the anti-Dodge stat, mandatory for Ranged builds (recommend 20-40), and recommended for everyone else (min of 10) but don&#39;t stack too much of this stat.</li>
<li>Resistance Reduction - the anti-Resistance, treat it like accuracy. Generally 10-20 is more than enough as most enemies don&#39;t have high resist and Magic damage reduces this by half first</li>
<li>Reliability - aka increased minimum damage, nice to have but not necessary, mainly useful for Longbows and other weapons with large damage ranges. Usually Cherry Picking and Confident are enough, but it is fun to always do max damage if you can fit it in.</li>
<li>Secondary Stats (Momentum, Opportunist, Isolated) - these are highly build specific so I recommend not choosing them unless that is exactly what your character is meant to do. Personally, I&#39;ve never gone out of my way for any of these other than Momentum.</li>
<li>Daily Mana Regen - I put this in offense because in the early nights this directly affects how often you can use your skills without outside assistance. <strong><em>Using Gear</em></strong> I try to have at least 3-7 on my melee heroes and 5-10 on Magic and Ranged heroes. Try not to use too many levels on this, usually 1 normal roll is enough.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Defense</strong> - optional for Magic and Ranged builds, highly recommended for Melee/Physical builds</p>

<ul>
<li>Armor - this is pseudo health and regenerates every turn, a great way to keep your heroes alive. I personally try to have at least a little armor on everyone. My melee heroes typically have ~20 armor for every level they are. (i.e. 200 at lvl 10)</li>
<li>Block - flat reduction in damage. <strong><em>Combined with Armor, this will make your heroes incredibly durable</em></strong>. Most enemy damage tops out at around 50-60, my melee heroes will typically have 30-40 block by Night 12. Remember though, I said &quot;most&quot;, bigger baddies (i.e. Axe Cleavers) can hit for 100+ easy.</li>
<li>Resistance - proportional reduction in damage. Should be treated as supplemental to the above, as most enemies just don&#39;t hit that hard so there&#39;s not as much value. If gear has it along with other good stats - great but don&#39;t go out of your way for it.</li>
<li>Dodge - should be treated like resistance, except when stacking dodge for Adrenaline Rush.</li>
<li>Daily Health Regen - nice but not great, only useful when combined with Coagulation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Builds &amp; Gear</h1>

<p>We won&#39;t go over every single build/gear type and combination but I will touch on some best practices and example builds you can use. No matter how you build your character you&#39;ll always want to remember these 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Focused stats - concentrate on 4-6 main/secondary stats</li>
<li>Specialized role - build your hero to do one thing and do it well</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Best Practices / Rules of Thumb</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Focus your hero on 1 main damage type (Physical, Ranged, Magic)</li>
<li>Once you choose your main damage type choose your weapon</li>
<li>Your weapon and its skills will tell you what stats you&#39;ll need to be viable</li>
<li>Every weapon/skills will have flaws, your job is to overcome or work around them</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapon as often as possible - 95% of the time a higher tier version will be better</li>
<li>Don&#39;t ignore accuracy, a dodge means no damage and wasted AP</li>
<li>AoE is your friend, until its not. AoE is expensive both in Mana and AP, try to maximize the damage you do with the AP AND Mana you have</li>
<li>Remember its a marathon, not a sprint - always build your heroes to have high and consistent damage output</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example Builds / Personal Favorites</strong></p>

<p>The below builds are ones I have personally used in multiple runs and know their effectiveness. I kept the gear/perks on the light side because a lot comes down to play style. If anyone else has different example builds for different weapons/concepts they love, let me know and I can add them.</p>

<p><em>Sword Ronin (Physical)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Sword</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Physical Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Momentum &gt; Skill Range &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Armor &gt; Block &gt; Health Regen</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Berserk, Mana Collector/Thrifty, Coagulation, Swift as the Wind</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll start with a melee build because there are mixed feelings about melee. This is an old favorite that you can rely on (unless you&#39;re stunned).  The sword is IMO one of the best melee weapons. With Skill Range you can zip around your quadrant of the map with only 3 AP and average movement. Combined with Momentum, this will ensure anything you hit with your Slice will die (if it doesn&#39;t, just fly around and come back for them). You&#39;ll want at least 30% Momentum and +1 Skill range but I recommend 40-50% and +2. Also I&#39;ll reiterate from the Stats section, you&#39;ll want a minimum of 30 block and for every level of the Hero around 20 armor . Lastly, <strong><em>beware of Stun</em></strong>!</p>

<p><em>Two Sword Ronin (Physical)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Sword &amp; Two Hand Sword</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Physical Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Momentum &gt; Skill Range &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Armor &gt; Block &gt; Health Regen</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Berserk, Mana Collector/Thrifty, Coagulation, Swift as the Wind</li>
</ul>

<p>These all won&#39;t be melee builds I promise. Identical to the previous build but also has the additional Two Hand Sword you can switch to, the added mobility options greatly increase both your damage and AoE. The Two Hand Sword&#39;s Thrust also has a higher base Momentum bonus which means you&#39;re guaranteed to kill something with it. I added the first one just in case some people don&#39;t have Two Hand sword unlocked. Also, I can&#39;t say this enough, <strong><em>beware of Stun</em></strong>!</p>

<p><em>Archer (Ranged)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Short Bow and/or Long Bow</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Ranged Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Accuracy &gt;  Reliability &gt; Skill Range</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Energized, Mana Collector, Thrifty, Confident, Steady Aim</li>
</ul>

<p>The classic choice for defending walls and raining death against hordes of anything. The Short Bow&#39;s main attack has the added benefit of <em>No Dodge</em>, which can let you give up some Accuracy for more damage or other support stats. The Long Bow is more damage oriented and has Isolated on its main attack but you will need a bit more Accuracy to take full advantage of its massive range. I&#39;ve once placed a maxed range (+5 for a total of 19) Long Bow Archer on a watch tower in the northern corner of town and he could reach 50% of the map.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 3 Demon Hunter (Ranged)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Hand Crossbow (optional Short/Long Bow)</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Ranged Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Multi Hit &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Accuracy &gt;  Reliability &gt; Skill Range</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Energized, Mana Collector, Initiator, Crit Master</li>
</ul>

<p>If built correctly, the Hand Crossbow is probably <strong><em>one of the strongest weapons currently in the game</em></strong>. Stacking Multi Hit lets you get more bang for your buck and doesn&#39;t cost you any Mana to hit/kill multiple enemies. Blaze, the 4th skill is 2 AP &amp; 2 Mana for Multi Hit + Propagation which can easily clear out a good chunk of the wave on one flank. Its so strong that one reddit user was able to do multiple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlXeZOpFqXw">solo runs</a> on normal and the highest Apocalypse. (sorry I couldn&#39;t find the original post)</p>

<p>Wizard <em>(Magic) [Insert Harry Potter Meme here]</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Tome of Secrets and/or Wand</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Magic Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Propagation Bounce/Multi Hit &gt; Accuracy</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Energized, Mana Collector, Initiator, Crit Master</li>
</ul>

<p>The classic spell slinger of sorcery. Tome of Secrets&#39; normal attack is a solid damage dealer but Lightning strike is probably one of my favorite skills because I like propagation. Expensive, yes, but effective and if combined with Specialist and Mana Collector perk, you get 2 free chains.  Swapping Specialist for the Wand&#39;s let&#39;s you use Magic Missile to clean up anything that&#39;s left. If you have it unlocked Meteor is also a fun choice.</p>

<p>Cheerleader <em>(Magic)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Wand</li>
<li>Stat Priority: AP &gt; Magic Dmg &gt; Dmg &gt; Crit + Crit Dmg &gt; Multi Hit &gt; Accuracy</li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Cheer, Energized, Mana Collector, Initiator, Potion Throw + Overload</li>
</ul>

<p>This one I&#39;ve moved away from but was super helpful in my earliest playthroughs. Cheer gives an ally in a range of 3 (very short) a 10% damage buff, while the Wand&#39;s Transfer gives an ally 1 AP and 2 Movement. Combine that with Potion Throw and giving someone (i.e. your sniper archer) the Damage Buff potion, they become a force of nature.</p>

<p><em>Plague Master aka Druid (Poison/Magic)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Weapon(s): Druid Staff (optional Magic Orb/Dagger)</li>
<li>Stat Priority: Poison &gt; Magic Dmg &gt; Crit &gt; Dmg &gt; Crit Dmg &gt; Propagation Bounce </li>
<li>Recommended Perks: Potent Toxins, Mana Collector, Initiator, Potion Throw + Overload</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least, the Druid. Poison is the name of the game, say it loud, say it proud, and spread its glory it everyone and everything (except maybe your allies). This build will take a lot more management so I don&#39;t recommend it for beginners as you&#39;ll need to know who will die this turn and where the survivors will go. You will also need to babysit your propagation more so the right monsters get hit twice (for more poison) to die. Single target damage also tends to need more management. That being said, once you get the hang of it, your Druid will easily be able to hold their own.</p>

<h1>Town Management</h1>

<p><strong>Days/Nights 1-4</strong></p>

<p>Economy - <em>&quot;He who wishes to fight must first count the cost&quot; - Sun Tzu, The Art of War</em></p>

<p>War is expensive, you will need gold and lots of it. One of the first Blessings you should work towards is Gold Mine. During a fresh run, my <strong><em>#1 priority is to get a maxed out Gold Mine up and running</em></strong>. When I say max I mean the first upgrade path for production, I only ever get additional 1 worker upgrade (total of 2 uses) because IMO the others aren&#39;t worth it. If you need a few nights to get it max, that&#39;s okay but try not to take more than 3 nights. Also try to upgrade the first mine before building a second one. Yes, it takes money to make money and you should try to only get the best upgrades from the shop.</p>

<p>Defense</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry too much about your walls, if you have the Vintage Walls upgrade or for walls in general, they are meant to be hit so let them distract the horde while you lay waste to them. If you find yourself having a hard time in nights 3 or 4 and have minimal walls remaining, remember that quantity trumps quality here, barricades and diagonals are your friend. A double row of barricades are slightly cheaper than a full line of regular wood walls. Yes, they will kill your barricade in 1 shot but you bought yourself 1 turn. <strong><em>Remember the primary purpose of your defenses early on is to slow the horde down, not to be an impregnable fortress</em></strong>. If you don&#39;t trust your walls at least you still have those destroyed buildings to block the horde and not your precious gold mines...right?</p>

<p><strong>Days/Nights 5-8</strong></p>

<p>Economy</p>

<p>By this point you are either on your last legs or crushing it, there doesn&#39;t seem to be an in-between. If you are the latter, hopefully you have 2-3 maxed out Gold Mines, so what do you spend all of your gold on? It will be a delicate balancing act amongst the Inn, the Seer, the Armor Maker, Blacksmith/Bowyer/Magic Shop (aka Weapon Maker), and Houses. I&#39;ll leave it up to you which you need in any given run but I recommend getting the Armor Maker and Seer ASAP. <strong><em>The Seer can push the Fog back 2 tiles every single day</em></strong> - this is huge. For Armor and Weapon makers, I recommend getting at least the first production upgrade, then balancing between the Item tier upgrades and production upgrades - save worker upgrades for last as only the final worker upgrade makes them all worth it. New Houses should be added as needed to power those additional buildings, don&#39;t upgrade houses until you have built all 6. You will also probably be adding 1 new hero every other night to your roster. Don&#39;t forget to <strong><em>keep your Heroes&#39; gear top-of-the-line, especially the weapons</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Defense - <em>&quot;The best defense is a good offense&quot;</em></p>

<p>Also at this point you can probably afford full rows of regular walls on 2 sides of your town each night, if you can use reinforced walls, do it on the side where your weaker heroes are defending. Alternatively, you can <strong><em>start investing in Ballistas</em></strong> instead of reinforced walls. I prefer placing Ballistas near corners.</p>

<p><strong>Days/Nights 9-11</strong></p>

<p>Economy</p>

<p>Congratulations, you&#39;ve come a long way, your victory is almost assured. By now you&#39;re probably Scrooge McDuckin&#39; it through all of your gold and your Armor Maker and Weapon Maker are running at full steam for your army of 6 Heroes. At this point you&#39;ve probably got money to burn, consider finishing those worker upgrades on your Armor Maker and Weapon Maker and maxing out your Shop. You can also start investing in Scavenger Camps if you want a little extra &quot;<em>umph!</em>&quot; in your defenses. Alternatively you can use your extra gold and upgrade your Ballistas to shoot 2 enemies. (you&#39;re welcome)</p>

<p>Defense</p>

<p>Secondary congratulations, you&#39;ve unlocked Traps! I have honestly only used the damage trap because...uh, well, refer to the Stats - Offense section above. The damage trap will deal decent damage in a 3x3 area centered around the trap, it will only activate if an enemy ends their turn on it, has 2 uses, and does NOT deal friendly fire damage. If you purchased the Watchtowers or Catapults I recommend you start placing them down as well. I personally like putting Watchtowers, Advanced Ballistas, and Catapults in corners and then placings stone walls there. (they can shoot the horde but the horde can&#39;t shoot back)</p>

<p><strong>Day11/Night 12</strong></p>

<p>This is it, this is your hero moment. So close and yet so far. You totally crushed Night 11, most of your 6 Heroes have +4 weapons or better, you have more gold than King Midas hugging the moon, your town is now Helms Deep, and your production buildings are pumping out more gear than a Borderlands 3 boss kill. <strong><em>What could possibly go wrong?!?!</em></strong> The only advice I have for you is to make sure your town&#39;s defenses and Heroes are equally strong on <strong><em>all sides</em></strong>. You will understand what I mean when you use all of the Seer upgrades to gain more info on Night 12. Good Luck, Have Fun, and thanks for reading. And remember - Damage, Damage, and MORE Damage.</p>

<h1>TLDR:</h1>

<ul>
<li>I haven&#39;t done or used everything, this is to help those who haven&#39;t finished N12 on normal</li>
<li>Prioritize Tainted Essence upgrades - ask yourself <em>&quot;Will I use this?&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;How often will I use this?&quot;</em></li>
<li>Unlock Blessings for your play style, Gold Mine, and Inn - you can always do farming runs to unlock any of them</li>
<li>Hero Stats (Offense) - focus on damage (primary and secondary) and crit/crit power to the point where you can kill most enemies in 1 shot reliably</li>
<li>Hero Stats (Defense) - mainly for melee, focus on armor and block, they&#39;ll make you much more durable</li>
<li>Builds &amp; Gear best practices - concentrate on 4-6 main/secondary stats and build your hero to do one thing and do it well</li>
<li>Days/Nights 1-4 (Economy) - #1 priority is to get a maxed out Gold Mine up and running</li>
<li>Days/Nights 1-4 (Defenses) - the primary purpose of your defenses early on is to slow the horde down, not to be an impregnable fortress</li>
<li>Days/Nights 5-8 (Economy) - Consider building the Inn, Seer, Armor Maker, and Blacksmith/Bowyer/Magic Shop and keep your Heroes&#39; gear top-of-the-line, especially the weapons. Prioritize the Seer as it can push the fog back 2 tiles every day</li>
<li>Days/Nights 5-8 (Defenses) - Consider investing in Ballistas, I prefer corner placement</li>
<li>Days/Nights 9-11 (Economy) - use your gold to max out your production buildings and Shop, consider a Scavenger Camp for more Defenses or spend gold to upgrade your Ballistas</li>
<li>Days/Nights 9-11 (Defenses) - use your extra materials to shore up your walls and placing more offensive measures such as Traps, Catapults, Ballistas, and Watchtowers</li>
<li>Day11/Night 12 - make sure your team and town is equally strong on all sides. Good Luck, Have Fun, and thanks for reading</li>
</ul>

<h2>I beat the last spell on run #3. Here's what I learned, my strategy, and my advanced tips</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/ThatEagle </span><span class = "numcomments">24 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastspell/comments/o1anbl/i_beat_the_last_spell_on_run_3_heres_what_i/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(625)">View full post</button><div id="625" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi friends. I did night 6 on my very first run, night 8 on my second, and i beat it on my third. You can check the videos.  Just some background to show that what i am about to say might makes some sens. I played the demo exactly once shortly before the early access.</p>

<p>I value your time, so I&#39;ll spare you the &quot;click the mouse button to attack&quot; type of tips and focus on the biggest tips i can think of right now :</p>

<p>- <strong>The best weapons for the 3 classes</strong> <em>in my experience</em> : Shortbow (hand crossbow comes close but it needs multihits and + propagation to shine, so more RNG dependant, shortbow is solid from the start). Tome for mage. Dagger if you have sources of multihit, else spear. However if you want to learn more, there is a guy who wrote an excellent and very long guide on Steam (not me) i recommend you check it out. You can&#39;t miss it, it&#39;s literally the first guide that shows up for the game.</p>

<p>- <strong>You always want a secondary weapon to complete your first.</strong> Keyword here is complete. It would be too long to do all weapons, so let me cover just those i feel are the strongest.—For instance I really like <strong>shortbow + hand crossbow OR</strong> <strong>Double shortbow</strong> also works pretty well. Smash enemies with shortbow (or tome) and finish the weak ones with multihits from the hand crossbow, it&#39;s very AP efficient. Using shortbow AOE if they are bunched up, or the hand crossbow single target if they are spread out is very convenient. But eventually we want the shortbow to be a unique weapon for the 20% damage and +1 charge, and hire a new hero to focus on the hand crossbow... You always want hand crossbows because they are so versatile, single target, AOE, and the -1 move per hit is just beautiful thing and a life saver. + it leaves space for a shield or an offhand weapon.—<strong>The dagger works well with the spear</strong>, or generally an AOE melee. Smash the huge area with spear, and clean up the other enemies with the ranged dagger ability, preferably in reverse order to benefit from the +1multishot perk on the dagger.—<strong>For mage&#39;s tome, I like the druid staff</strong> as a secondary. It helps you with an additional propagation ability, more single target charges, and utility like slowing down enemies when overwhelmed. But as with the shortbow, we eventually want to end up with &quot;specialist&quot; for the extra charge on the AOE and the +20% damage which increases  ourchance to one shot everything.</p>

<p>- <strong>Defense stats are dead stats.</strong> I completely ignore defensive stats and simply do not get hit 95% of the time. You can watch my streams on twitch, user &quot;drakenkin&quot; if you want to see how i play. So ignore health, armor, block, etc and focus on your damage. Mana regen is a dead stat, health regen, same dead dead dead. Max mana matters a bit early (because it restores mana points by the amount of the increase), but becomes useless once you have mana per crit +15 crit to healthy targets, etc. You will simply get back all the mana from attacking and never need potions, and occasionally you won&#39;t even need to build the mana well itself. (Especially if you have a lot of bonus experience and get the crit per mana ahead of the curve.)</p>

<p>- If you&#39;re not playing with the above weapons, keep in mind <strong>you can win with almost anything if you use the weapon well</strong>. Ok maybe not the sword, that one is just sad. For instance using the hammer with its big AOE stun can make it so the close enemies can&#39;t attack you, and others can&#39;t access you since your sides are occupied by stunned enemies. Effectively serving as walls. If you are using the weapons to their full potential, you will do just fine.</p>

<p>- <strong>The perks</strong>, it&#39;s sad to say but <strong>most of them are useless</strong>. You want the 25xp first. You want either the +multishot, the +souls, or the +50% reliability to single targets. Reliability is a huge boost to DPS on weapons like the shortbow or tome and should not be underestimated. Most likely you want the 50% reliability when healthy and the -1 mana cost per turn also, this alone buys you 2+ more castings of your major AOE per night. Later you obviously want the +15%crit on health targets and the mana per crit. Finally, you want the AP per kill chance in the last line of perks. If you&#39;re struggling with the game, pick the 30% damage to enemies inside the village instead, until you&#39;re more comfortable keeping your village safe. After this you can go back and pick things that make your build better or more fun. But there are very few exceptions to this build order. You can watch my video dedicated to perks (posted yesterday June the 15th called &quot;strategy guide&quot;), it has a lot more in depth explanations of the logic behind these choices. I believe it will really give you clarity on what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not.</p>

<p>- <strong>The seer.</strong> I only use push back the fog like twice over a full run. I like the fog to be close so the enemies can bunch up and I can AOE more easily. My rule of thumb is that if enemies can spawn and attack my walls / building immediately, i will push back the fog... else it&#39;s a waste. Factor in the runners, but not the archers in this. I am very greedy with the fog and i use the villagers for something more useful. Also, I don&#39;t use reveal enemies because i don&#39;t care what comes, it&#39;s just a waste of villagers. I also don&#39;t find looking at quantity per direction useful, since i prioritize move points, i can rotate my heroes to where they are needed most. So the seer is literally just to push the fog a couple of times, don&#39;t let it be a villager sink. You want villagers for the gold, the materials, the items crafting. Using the seer too much will weaken you.</p>

<p>- <strong>Think barricades instead of walls.</strong> Early on, the barricade will soak up 2 hits. BUT you should probably save your materials until day 4-5+ because the first waves are so easy wasting materials is not optimal. Also you don&#39;t care about those ruin walls that you can&#39;t repair, it&#39;s OK to lose them in the first days while you build up your economy. The only thing i would spend materials on early are ballista and catapults since they will help you for the length of the run and they are never a waste. Later on enemies do so much damage than even big walls will fall to 1 or 2 hits, so you might as well spend 7 materials instead of 60 and get more of them. But i have to say that your walls should never be hit anyway (except by archers). Your big walls serve as cover vs archers. Your barricades are the things that will buy you some time should something slip by. Think of your barricades as your first line of defense, and your walls as a backup if something goes wrong. Literally, archers should be the only thing able to attack your walls 95% of the time. Again to see this kind of tactics in action, watch my twitch plays : drakenkin.</p>

<p>- This is stupid and i hope it&#39;s fixed soon. <strong>But equipping an item with +health will wound you</strong>. It increases your max health, but doesn&#39;t add hp points for that. This is important because it disables your 50% reliability perk, or forces you to waste resource on healing. For this reason I would recommend you buy the item, but only equip it once you are already wounded and will heal anyway. Personally i just avoid +health items because i rarely build the healing building until night 7+ (and when i do its because i need it as a wall) as i almost never get hit. And i don&#39;t want to waste gold on health potions early either.</p>

<p>- This one is big! <strong>Learn to prioritize.</strong> Things that can&#39;t reach your walls or heroes can be left last. Focus on the big targets like boomers and splitters, the archers, the fast moving units. If you can&#39;t kill all, think about movement. Can you wound something enough that it loses move points and can&#39;t attack anything on this turn? that&#39;s almost as good as killing it. You have to balance killing with delaying, and this is why the hand crossbow is so god damn sexy. Having 3-4-5-6 attacks with 1 ap (stacking multishot) and having each one of these attacks remove movement from enemies will completely neutralize big meanies like the boomers, lancers, and whatever else is increasing your blood pressure. Have you ever seen a boomer with ZERO move points? it&#39;s a beautiful thing to behold. Keep him there, and explode him when he&#39;s surrounded by walkers. Just like that, boomer works for you now.</p>

<p>- <strong>Tavern heroes scale with your current hero levels.</strong> For this reason, it would be ideal to ruff it up early and stick to 3 heroes for as long as possible, so you can get new heroes that are as high as possible. Basically delay buying new heroes until you absolutely need them. The other thing if this is true is that XP bonuses early on are very valuable. So you really want that 25% xp perk first, and you want to take even more xp stats are you level up early on. Personally i consider taking the xp if its&#39; green or higher even over some decent stats early on, not every time, but let&#39;s just say it&#39;s worth thinking about it twice.</p>

<p>EDIT: confirmed by a dev in the comments below. Here&#39;s the quote <em>&quot;So, actually, it DOES scale with your Heroes&#39; level and not days ;) — There is indeed a single recruitment slot labelled as &quot;high&quot;, but it will offer you a Hero with a level between the average level of your team and the highest level within it.&quot;</em></p>

<p>- Ok this is a fundamental principle. You want to kill things instead of delaying them whenever possible. For this reason, you will always <strong>prioritize damage over stun and utility / tanking stats</strong>, and you will always prioritize weapons like the dagger and spear over the hammer, because those can actually kill instead of wound and stun. What you want to do is kill as many per turn, ideally wiping the wave completely sometimes. If your decisions are always focusing on being able to kill more and more efficiently (instead of defense, tanking, utility, or some other distractions), the game becomes a lot easier.</p>

<p>- <strong>Grab those armors with teleport every. single. time.</strong> Those are amazing. They basically add +4 moves to your hero, and let you jump both enemies and walls. Huge! I&#39;ll take those over anything, and even better they always come with a +1 move on the armor itself. 5 move points from one item, take that and slap it on your melee. It&#39;s so broken-level good.</p>

<p>- The shop can only give you level 3-4 items when fully upgraded. <strong>The only way to get level 5 items is crafting</strong>, and this is why the crafting buildings might seem expensive and superfluous at first, but they do actually have a purpose. That being said, this is only necessary on the higher difficulty when enemies have more HP. I beat the game on normal with level 3-4 weapons just fine and didn&#39;t feel weak by not having higher level.  In fact i <strong>start by crafting armors since those can be used by all heroes</strong>, instead of crafting specific weapons that are only useful for one class. If i had to craft weapons, i would go for ranged or magic so i can find magic ones with +multishot or +propagation. But those can also be found on armors and trinkets, so i still think armors are the optimal priority for crafting. </p>

<p>- To push the previous tip further, because it&#39;s important. Are you under estimating crafting? Think about it this way, you either use the items, or sell them for gold. And those items can sell for 25 gold or more, so it&#39;s no chump money. <strong>Crafting is the only way to boost your gold income when your gold mines are maxed out.</strong></p>

<p>- Possibly obvious, but worth mentioning. <strong>Always repair a wall before upgrading it.</strong> It ends up being cheaper. </p>

<p>- If you have nice gold economy but less materials, <strong>consider using buildings as disposable walls.</strong> I almost never build the temple, but when i do, i do it because i need a cheap 3 tile wall with 150hp. The other cheap gold wall i use is the secondary armory, first one gets upgraded and is well tucked in and safe inside my base, the second one is a shield against the horde. These buildings are 55 and 70 gold, it&#39;s pretty cost efficient to cover a flank. I really like to keep my materials for the occasional wall, the occasional, ballista to focus runners trying to get into my base or whatever is closest, and <strong>most of the materials will go into making TRAPS</strong>. I am talking about the explosive type. They are just amazing. 9 tiles area, multiple charges, it chews up enemies and let you one shot them easier. By the endgame the outside of my village is surrounded by what to think of as the &quot;traps donut&quot;. Mmm donuts. What more, they used to hurt your heroes and buildings, with the last patch they won&#39;t anymore. Traps are just OP, especially the damage ones and the slow ones. Think about alternating them for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>- Small tip, it can be hard to tell exactly where the fog stops. What you can do, <strong>use a barricade or trap to see exactly where the fog starts</strong>. You can do this by hovering these on the edge of the map. This is very useful to calculating where things like runners and archers will spawn and where they can reach. This will help you <strong>decide where to position your heroes exactly to be safe</strong>, and decide if you need to push the fog back with seer or not. </p>

<p>Bonus tip!</p>

<p>- <strong>There are many ways to win this game</strong>, don&#39;t think there is only one path to victory. This game is difficult, but there is plenty of room for different play styles and you don&#39;t always need to min max or use the same ideas to win. For instance, i like to have very few walls, very few static defenses like siege weapons if any (i love traps however, and catapults are very strong), and i like having a lot of move points for rotations. You might like a lot of walls and a lot of ballista or catapults and be able to shoot things with longbows over walls. That&#39;s fine. So even if you read or watch someone over the internet, remain free to experiment your own ideas and play style... that&#39;s where the fun is!</p>

<p>I hope this guide was useful and that you didn&#39;t mind a bit of shameless self promotion too much!</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to request a specific guide, ill be happy to answer.</p>

<h2>Tips for beginners from beginners</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(635)">View full post</button><div id="635" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Really love the game and, now that I’ve spent a bit of time with it, I’ve compiled a few tips I think are important for folks just starting out. These aren’t “winning” tips per se but they will help you get a handle on the game.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many attacks reduce the enemies’ movement. This isn’t well explained by the game but you can easily see their available movement by hovering over an enemy. Enemies that are damaged and have reduced movement should be considered low priority for this reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Some enemies don’t care about engaging you and prefer to attack the town. It’s best if you don’t let them as that will raise your panic level.</p></li>
<li><p>Workers are more useful than they seem at first and are well worth investing in.</p></li>
<li><p>You can upgrade lower level walls to higher level ones, making the flimsier options not so bad as a placeholder.</p></li>
<li><p>The most unfair element of your first few runs is the mist. You don’t have any way to push it back and once it’s against your walls you’re kinda screwed. Don’t worry, there will be solutions for that later.</p></li>
<li><p>Each damage type (melee, ranged, magic) has an inherent bonus. Melee is extra effective against armor for example. Internalize that!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway that’s just a few things I wish I knew earlier. What about you?</p>

<h2>Step by Step Economy Setup Guide Day 1 to 4</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(636)">View full post</button><div id="636" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Welcome to The Last Spell Economy Setup Guide.</p>

<p>This is optimized for a DAY 4 seer (with the presumption that you go Inn on day 5) This assumes you are playing on Apocalypse 2 or below and have none of the meta progression regarding starting gold. You must complete waves with no panic for the math to add up.</p>

<p>A bit of a legend to the numbers (to prove the math works) First number is net change. Second number is current gold.</p>

<p>Day 1. Starting cash 100 gold, 4 workers</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a gold mine (-45, 55)</li>
<li>Upgrade gold mine with 40 gold upgrade (-40, 15)</li>
<li>Work the gold mine. (+25, 40)</li>
<li>Upgrade the gold mine with the 25 gold upgrade and work again (0, 40)</li>
<li>Pick a two tile building and deconstruct it (+14, 54)</li>
<li>Sell any item(starting items are generally worth between 4-6) (+4, 58)</li>
<li>Build a house (-55, 3)</li>
<li>Pick a two tile building and deconstruct it (+14, 17)</li>
<li>Buy your item back (-4, 13)</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 2 Starting cash 148 (110 base +25 mine. 13 starting), 6 workers</p>

<ul>
<li>Work your mine twice (+50, 198)</li>
<li>Upgrade your mine with the 90 upgrade (-90, 108)</li>
<li>Build a new mine (-45, 68)</li>
<li>Upgrade the mine for 40 gold (-40, 28)</li>
<li>Work the mine and then upgrade for 25 (0, 28)</li>
<li>Work the mine again (+25, 53)</li>
<li>Scrap a two tile building (+14, 67)</li>
<li>Build a house (-55, 14)</li>
<li>Scrap a two tile building (+14, 28)</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 3, starting cash 233 (130 Base +75 mines, 28 starting) 8 workers</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade your most upgraded mine with the 200 gold upgrade (-200, 33)</li>
<li>Work that sucker twice (+110, 143)</li>
<li>Upgrade it for 100 and work it third time (-45, 98)</li>
<li>Upgrade your second mine for 90 (-90, 8)</li>
<li>Work it twice (+50, 58)</li>
<li>Build a house (-55, 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 4 Starting cash 343 (Base 180 +160 mines, 3 starting)  10 workers</p>

<ul>
<li>Work your fully upgraded mine (+165, 508)</li>
<li>Upgrade your second mine with the 200 gold upgrade and then work it twice (-90, 418)</li>
<li>Build a third mine (-45, 378)</li>
<li>Upgrade it with the the 40 gold upgrade, the 90 gold upgrade, and then the 200 gold upgrade (-330, 48)</li>
<li>Work the mine twice (+110, 158)</li>
<li>Buy the seer and spend 3 workers to push back the fog (-140, 18 gold)</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 5 Starting Cash 558 (Base 210 +330 mines, +18 gold) 10 workers</p>

<ul>
<li>Etc (generally inn here finish the other two mines, do whatever with the rest of the cash)</li>
<li>If you are feeling strong you can also go for a fully upgraded item building here. I&#39;ll note that this is VERY greedy and may or may not pay off (Upgrade level of item , and then worker production  on it first) Passive last -probably just want the 30 gold upgrade for 10 passive passive production.</li>
</ul>

<p>Saucychemist posted a more optimized build order below in the comments. This is still good enough to win. Theirs is better overall by a decent bit.</p>
