<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I put together this list of tips and tricks I&#39;ve found on <a href="/r/vinyl">/r/vinyl</a>, in the hopes that those who see it can have a nice centralized location to check a bunch of things out. I pretty much searched for posts that had keywords like tips, tricks, or guides then cataloged them here. I&#39;ve been sitting on this for a while,and figured I&#39;d just go ahead and share it. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of good threads that I missed, so instead of spending weeks poking through everything I figured some crowdsourcing would help finish it out.</p>

<p>Without furthur ado, here is the list.</p>

<li>When looking at used equipment you don&#39;t know anything about, do a google search. If nothing pops up on AudioKarma or other forums about it, then it&#39;s probably not that great</li>
<li>When searching on Craigslist, also check common misspellings. reciever instead of receiver might turn up something that&#39;s been overlooked.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-D5S6-Deoxit-Contact-Cleaner/dp/B00006LVEU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374912378&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=deoxit">Deoxit</a> is a fantastic thing to have. It can fix many issues with vintage equipment such as crackly knobs. If you have a can then it can be worth taking a chance on a Goodwill receiver where one of the channels keeps cutting out.</li>
<li>A small piece of Mr Clean Magic Eraser is perfect for cleaning dust off your stylus. Just gently touch the stylus to it. You could glue part of the eraser to a coin to give it some weight.</li>
<li>Add releases to Discogs. This helps everyone out.</li>
<li>DVD storage crates are the perfect way to store 7&quot; records for cheap. There&#39;s things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ideastream-Snap-N-Store-Storage-Accents-SNS01524/dp/B000EFJY3U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374912564&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dvd+storage+box">this</a> from Amazon. In addition, Dollar Tree and Dollar General sell ones like <a href="http://www.kmart.com/united-plastics-mini-crate-black/p-9990000034592911P">this</a> for... you guessed it... $1.</li>

<li>For sleeves, normally it is recommended to buy from a local store. However, the two most recommended places online are <a href="https://www.bagsunlimited.com/c-57-audio.aspx">bagsunlimited</a> and <a href="http://www.sleevecityusa.com/record-sleeves-s/1828.htm">sleevecity</a>. I personally prefer Sleeve City, but whatever. They usually have a 15% off code floating around somewhere, and if you can ship to a business instead of a residence, you could save a few bucks too. My favorites for cost/quality are the <a href="http://www.sleevecityusa.com/resealable-3-mil-outer-lp-sleeves-pack-of-50-p/9222.htm">resealable 3 mil outer sleeve</a> and some <a href="http://www.sleevecityusa.com/Diskeeper-2-0-Antistatic-Record-Sleeves-p/9235.htm">Disckeeper inners</a>. Another great option from Amazon that has Prime shipping are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/INDUSTRY-STANDARD-Plastic-Sleeves-12SE03/dp/B000RA7IZS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375060617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=record+sleeve">these 3 mil outers</a> (nonresealable, but cheaper than Sleeve City). I don&#39;t buy anything less than disckeepers for my inners if I value the record. 80&#39;s hair metal can get the paper sleeves though. Whatever you do, don&#39;t skimp on your outer sleeves, cheap ones can split easily, are &quot;crinkly&quot;, and just don&#39;t feel as good as nicer ones.</li>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty I missed. If you know of any other good posts to include, please link them so I can edit this to reflect that. Also, if you can think of some questions you see asked all the time, post that too and I will search for answer threads to add. More general tips that don&#39;t really need an entire thread would be great. Guides from all over the interwebs are welcome as well. Anything and everything that is helpful is eligble to be added.</p>
