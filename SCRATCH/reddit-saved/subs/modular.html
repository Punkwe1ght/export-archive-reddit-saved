Have logged a ton of time with softsynths in the ~7 months since I started playing around with music production and sound synthesis which taught me a lot about the very basics (shout outs to Harmor and Serum, among many others) of synthesis in general along with some meandering around in the Sound On Sound Synth Secrets article series, but a lot of that doesn&#39;t help tangibly when it comes to modular synths because there&#39;s a whole level of other stuff to learn and internalize when you&#39;re just starting out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping you guys can help with responses about any newbie stumbling blocks you ran into when starting out that may have made you just sit there and scratch your head without having any idea where to go next.</p>

<p>For example, it JUST clicked for me in the last day or so that your envelope generator module normally isn&#39;t supposed to output an audio signal to a mixer or fx module (unless it is - heh), but rather that it outputs control voltage to a VCA or other module&#39;s CV input and that&#39;s how you get envelopes working. The overall lesson being: some modules do CV, some do audio, some do both and it&#39;s probably good to be conscious of this. It&#39;s a dumb one, and I feel pretty dumb for it, but that&#39;s the nature of learning totally alien things. It was also pretty satisfying when I came to the realization; like another small piece falling into place.</p>

<p>Do you guys have anything like that to share? Alternately, is there a better subreddit for this topic?</p>
