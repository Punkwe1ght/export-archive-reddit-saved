<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came here from a thread in <a href="/r/nfl">/r/nfl</a> where some people were saying ray is an example of an athlete getting away with a huge crime and a Ravens fan defending him and getting downvoted to hell.  So I&#39;m not really asking what Ray did, I can Google that, I&#39;m asking how do you guys feel about ray and about what happened? And do you think that we wouldn&#39;t be defending him at all if he wasn&#39;t who he is? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some <a href="http://imgur.com/QKB9iZf">bonus Flacco</a>. Thanks for your help! </p>
