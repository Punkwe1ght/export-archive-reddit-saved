<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, all. I&#39;m looking forward to making my first pot this year sometime soon. I recently returned from a trip to Florida, and they had &#39;authentic&#39; Gumbo on the menus there, so I figured I&#39;d write a post about the subject. I don&#39;t claim to know everything, but I think people could use some pointers. This is not meant as a historical origins or anything, just what it is like in Louisiana in modern times.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am the creator of the <a href="http://jambalayacalculator.com/excel-spreadsheet/">Jambalya Calculator</a> and this guy helped me do it.  Very authentic Cajun (no tomatoes) jambalaya.</p>

<p><strong>Jambalaya Gonzales Style</strong></p>

<p>This recipe is for a 6 quart Dutch oven and feeds 8 to 10 with sides.</p>

<p>3 1/2 lbs pork temple meat (or pork shoulder) or boneless chicken thighs or sausage</p>

<p>Cajun seasoning (or a mix of salt, pepper and garlic powder)</p>

<p>1 lb andouille or good smoked sausage</p>

<p>¾ cup vegetable oil</p>

<p>3 cups long grain rice</p>

<p>3 medium onions, diced</p>

<p>4 green onions, chopped</p>

<p>1 Tbs minced garlic</p>

<p>6 cups broth (or water)</p>

<p>A little more water (for unsticking meat from the pot)</p>

<p>1 Tbs chicken soup base or 3 bouillon cubes (double if using water)</p>

<p>3 Tbs Louisiana Hot Sauce</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cut the pork into cubes, trying to keep a small piece of fat on each (It enhances flavor and tenderness.) Season the meat.</p></li>
<li><p>Brown the meat down really well. Let the meat fry until it starts to stick, then stir. Do that over and over again. Let it stick, then stir. Repeat. Sometimes a little water is needed to cool off the grease. The meat debris that sticks to the bottom of the pot (the gratin) will dictate your color of the rice/jamb. Season the meat each turn as you brown it. After the meat is browned down to dark fry, remove it completely from the pot.</p></li>
<li><p>Next brown down the sausage. Don&#39;t overcook the sausage and fry it too much. Just mildly brown it down – you don’t want to cook all of the taste out of the sausage.</p></li>
<li><p>After the sausage cooks a little, remove from the pot. Drain the grease out of the pot at this time but don’t lose the gratin (brown bits). Then add onions, green onions, garlic with a splash of water and cook till clear looking. This is when you scrape the bottom of the pot getting all the brown gratin from the pork. You will have to add small splashes of stock as you cook to not burn the trinity mix. This is when the color that the jambalaya starts to reveal it darkness. The browner the meat was cooked the darker the gratin will be making this mixture dark as well.</p></li>
<li><p>After the vegetables are cooked (clear looking) add all the meat back into the pot and mix well. Cook all the remaining water out of the pot at this time so the water measurements will be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the broth or water. Add the chicken base or bouillon cubes for added taste.</p></li>
<li><p>After it comes to a rolling boil, start tasting the liquid. You want it to be a tad bit salty because the rice will absorb the saltiness. Add the Louisiana Hot sauce.</p></li>
<li><p>Skim the remaining grease off the top. The boiling water will separate it from the broth.</p></li>
<li><p>After you get the taste like you want it and the pot is on a hard rolling boil, add the rice. Never add the rice until the water is boiling! Let it come back to a boil until the rice starts to expand and is &quot;jumping out the pot&quot;. This is an expression we use due to the hard boiling liquid and the rice entrained in the liquid sometimes comes over the side. This is very important in order to get the rice to “pop”. Let the rice get noticeably bigger/expanded before cutting the heat and covering. You can tell is getting ready when the rice is thickening by stirring your spoon in the mixture. As it thickens it will get noticeably harder to stir. This should be achieved on a HARD boil and it is critical to the rice popping correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>When the rice has started to expand, cut back on the heat to low and cover. Do not lift the lid for any reason. Let this cook for about 25 minutes and then lift the lid and “roll” the rice. Don&#39;t stir it - roll it from bottom to top at 4 different spots. Re-cover and cut heat off. Completely. Let sit for another 15 minutes and then un-cover and eat.</p></li>

<div class="md"><p>Come Back Sauce
makes about 1 ¼ cups</p>

<p>This sauce originated at the Mayflower Cafe in Jackson, Mississippi, where it was the house salad dressing. It got its name because diners kept &quot;coming back&quot; for it. Come Back Sauce pairs well with any kind of fried food (try fried green tomatoes) and also makes a tasty dip for cold boiled shrimp.</p>

<p>Ingredients
1 tbsp. grated onion (using the large holes of a box grater)
1 cup mayonnaise
3 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 tbsp. prepared chili sauce
1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. dry mustard
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</p>

<p>Preparation
Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl and stir well. If the sauce is too thick to drizzle, add 1 tbsp. water to thin.  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>What is in Gumbo?</strong> - <em>Anything that walks, swims, crawls or flies</em></p>

<p>This one may be sort of obvious, but I&#39;d like to clarify. Gumbos can have a lot of things in them, but there are some things a Gumbo <em>has</em> to have.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cuisine">Trinity</a></em> - Trinity is Celery, Bell Pepper and Onions. I usually use approximately equal parts but you can kinda do whatever you like. Don&#39;t write the celery off, though, without it it really loses a component. </p></li>
<li><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">Roux</a></em> - Flour and Oil/Fat, equal in weight, cooked. Could be blonde, could be brick, but your Gumbo has to have a roux. A note on roux:I have found that if you are making a seafood gumbo, you want a lighter roux, with less deep flavor, because it can overpower the seafood such as crab, fish or oysters. Lighter rouxs tend to thicken more, so you need less of them. Chicken and Sausage, or other meat-based gumbos, would generally use a darker roux for more flavor.</p></li>
<li><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_(food">Stock</a></em> - You could probably use water and still call it a gumbo, but that would be a shame. Your taste buds would be as sad as the color of the thing that you made.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of other things that are pretty traditional, and some people would probably argue that Bay Leaves have to be included, but honestly if you have those three central ingredients I think it all counts. What&#39;s next is two different combinations that results in the various ones you see out there, what I&#39;d call the Style and Variety. These are terms I&#39;ve just come up with, don&#39;t take it as cannon.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Styles of Gumbo</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Broadly speaking I believe there are two distinct styles of gumbo: Cajun and Creole. When debate rages about what a gumbo is, I believe most of the time the main problem is that people fail to distinguish between the two styles.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cajun</strong> - These <em>have a tendency</em> to have darker rouxs. Honestly I think of Cajun as the default, it has the three ingredients listed above and can be a number of varieties and that I&#39;ll list below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creole</strong> - Creole gumbos frequently, and I would say possibly have to have the three above, with the addition of Okra and Tomatoes. If you see &#39;red&#39; gumbos in pictures, this is why. Creole gumbos are more likely to be seafood gumbos.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Varieties</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Gumbo z&#39;Herbes</em> - This is a gumbo, made in either of the two styles above, with no meat. Greens are usually (99%) involved, and a lot of them because they cook down. I have seen people throw in a ham bone like any other time when you&#39;d cook greens. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Seafood</em> - There&#39;s no set ingredients for any gumbo, muchless Seafood, but seafood usually includes shrimp and crabs, specifically gumbo crabs. Everything else is just up to the cook. Oysters are not uncommon. Fish fillets sometimes, they usually break up though and I honestly haven&#39;t seen many seafood gumbos using fish. Theoretically you could use any sort of seafood. One thing I have seen a lot of that confuses me is Shrimp and Sausage. I really didn&#39;t see this growing up, and it really kinda flies in the face of what you are attempting to accomplish. Sausage will overpower the shrimp which is a real shame, I&#39;d advise against using it in a seafood gumbo, really. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Chicken and Sausage</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>Meat</em> - Chicken and Sausage is by far and away the most common gumbo I really see in Louisiana. Of course, you can use whatever you want. Other common ones are: Turkey and Sausage (Especially after Thanksgiving), Duck (Sometimes with Sausage), Turtle, Alligator, or combinations. I&#39;ve never seen a beef Gumbo but I&#39;m sure someone out there has made one. Never seen Deer, but Deer Sausage I have. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Other ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Filé</em> - Usually served with the gumbo, next to the salt and pepper. Some people like more, some people don&#39;t like it at all. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Other Seasonings</em> - Bay Leaves are almost always involved, but any other spices or herbs are pretty wide open. Not everything will fit the flavor profile. Usually people will say &#39;Cajun Spices&#39; but there&#39;s no agreement on what &#39;Cajun Spices&#39; are, really. Best bet is a can of Slap Ya Mama&#39;s or Tony Chacheres.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Corn</em> - This harkens back to when I went to Florida. On the picture with the word &#39;Authentic&#39; splashed a half dozen times over it was a bowl of soup with corn in it. I&#39;ve been making Gumbo for 25 years now and I have never once even heard of putting corn in it. You can do what you want, but that&#39;s like throwing corn on pizza (Which I think Switzerland or somewhere does). You can do it if you want but that&#39;s not how anyone in Louisiana I know of does it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, those are just my thoughts. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be flamed to hell and back, but lets hear it. </p>
