<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like the title says....I want to get some good smelling stuff for my house. Interested in thoughts and opinions from you all on what you prefer as far as candles/diffusers/wax warmers, and why you have your preferences.</p>

<p>Also interested to know recommended brands and scents. Do you do different fragrances for bedroom vs living room vs kitchen?</p>
