Such a genius Tek and as I said in the other post I had 14 great extractions. Here is just some of the results. </p>

<p>Fridge step is crucial and following measurements to a the letter. </p>

<p>Also gently drying at the lowest temp in a good dehydrator.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to wash those Jars out with warm water and filter/evap. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing medicine that has proven it&#39;s self time and time again  in group ceremonies </p>

<p>Much love üåµüåµüïâÔ∏è</p>

<h2>my crystalline tek</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(278)">View full post</button><div id="278" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>ever since i posted the picture of my last extraction, i have gotten about 5 requests a day for the tek so i decided to post it on here and share with all of you.</p>

<p>i despine the cutting first, then chop each piece to half the size of my thumb. then i freeze and thaw it twice and save the greenish liquid that comes out after you thaw. then it&#39;s ready to be simmered. </p>

<p>i fill up the pot about 1/3 of the way with water and heat it up. add the cacti pieces, green juice and 100ml vinegar into the heated up water and add more water if necessary, but make sure the water is hot. i like to fill it up close to the rim and add hot water if needed as time goes on. i simmer it for 5 hours with absolutely zero agitation. no stirring, no mashing, and do not let it boil. just simmer. be careful not to let it boil too much because then you&#39;ll be left with goopy resin and not crystals, that&#39;s also why there&#39;s no agitation.</p>

<p>you might have to add more water if it gets low, but make sure it&#39;s hot.</p>

<p>after 5 hours, i pour out the mescaline solution into a pyrex dish. some people recommend decanting the solution, but i find that it doesn&#39;t make a difference. </p>

<p>edit: it does make a difference to decant and filter it, so i would highly recommend doing that before continuing.</p>

<p>i let the solution sit overnight and then the next day it&#39;s ready to be evaporated. if you did it right, you will see some of the crystals form and the liquid will be golden. if it&#39;s kind of murky, that means you&#39;re going to end up with the goopy resin. i put the pyrex dish into the oven at 200 with a fan blowing into it on low until its all dry. i get this metal spatula and scrape it all off.</p>

<p>if you end up with resin, you&#39;re starting material was too dry, you agitated too much, or it was too hot. if you did it right you will end up like crystals from my post that ill link.</p>

<p>i hope this helps you beautiful people out and you have lovely experiences with the crystals.</p>

<p>here&#39;s my yield after 1 simmer</p>

<p>edit: forgot to add that after you do the first simmer, you can freeze the chunks if they&#39;re still bitter and repeat the process and if you take them together, you&#39;ll have a really good trip. im into low doses now, so i just take 1 simmer at a time. i usually only do 2 simmers, but i just finished my 2nd simmer of the same cutting and it was still bitter, so i stuck it in the freezer and i will do the whole thing again. for the 2nd simmer, you only have to do 4 hours. im not entirely sure about the 3rd simmer, but maybe do 3-4 hours just to be safe, but that will be less potent. the 2nd simmer is usually pretty strong, like pretty much as strong as the first simmer</p>

<p>here&#39;s the yield after my 2nd simmer</p>
