<h2>“Modern” design of experiments and algorithmic experimentation [Q]</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Direct-Touch469 </span><span class = "numcomments">20 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/14huqpw/modern_design_of_experiments_and_algorithmic/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(6)">View full post</button><div id="6" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Experimental design has been known to be a very “old” area of research in statistics departments. As everyone is talking about ML/DL hype, important topics like experimental design seem to get lost in discussion. I was curious and looked for what research actually goes on in experimental design. How this field is moving forward. With big tech companies needing to do lots of experimentation, I’d imagine there has been work in this area.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that there’s a whole body of literature, on designing experimental design methods based on optimization procedures. Bandits, some techniques with reinforcement learning, and other optimization algorithms have been used in experimental design. This seems quite interesting that the current state of experimental design is doing this kind of work, by using algorithmic/optimization approaches.</p>

<p>My question to you all, is that is this an area which gets much support in statistics departments? I think I only saw a group at CMU that works in this, but other than that maybe in biostats depts. if anyone here had done research in this area, could you speak to things you have researched or worked on in the context of algorithmic/optimization approaches.</p>

<h2>[Q] Bayesian statistics!</h2>

<p>Im not a very proficient statistician, but I love the subject and have been learning it through the last few years whenever I had the time just because I believe its amazing.</p>

<p>Although that being said, I was able to grasp concepts such as regressions and propensity/entropy matching etc. When it comes to Bayesian statistics, my mind just doesnt bend to the concept. I feel that my mind is stubborn with some concepts which is not making any sense. Hence I had a few questions:
1. Why Bayesian?
2. Where have you applied Bayesian?
3. Have you found a difference in Bayesian vs frequentist stats? In other words, when would you consider Bayesian statistics?
4. Did you have a similar difficult learning curve?
5. What resources helped you?</p>

<p>I’m a Data Analyst with a Physics background, and just wanted to get thoughts on my question above.</p>

<p>Typically, I would think that a larger sample size means you’ve got more statistical power, a smaller confidence interval, and ultimately more evidence to back up any conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p>

<p>Is there literally any situation where it’s better to have a smaller sample size, as opposed to a larger one? (Other than less data perhaps being easier to work with)</p>

<h2>[Q] What are the best analyses to use on my Fitbit data?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(121)">View full post</button><div id="121" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>Apologies if my questions are too basic for this sub. I want to learn statistical analysis methods and how and when to apply them. If there&#39;s a better sub for this kind of post, please let me know!</p>

<p>I have ADHD so looking things up doesn&#39;t work me well. What <em>does</em> work for me is thinking up personal projects that are relevant to me to work through. Just some numbers that have some significance to me that I can use to learn from, and having a direction to go in.</p>

<p>Now to my current project...</p>

<p>I have a very small data set (so far it&#39;s 57 records) that I have been recording of my daily health stats measured by my Fitbit. The list is long but I can put a list in the comments in case it helps generate some ideas.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of the potential inaccuracy of data recorded with my Fitbit device and some of the variables seem arbitrary, so I&#39;m more interested in the relationships between different variables and measuring trends than the actual figures themselves. No one is going to see this data or these insights thankfully.</p>

<p>How do I analyse the relationships between variables or the impact one (or more) variable has on another? For example, if I change my medication, does that affect my resting heart rate, or my sleep quality, and how significant is the effect? Are there other possible statistical analysis methods that I might not know even exist that I can learn to use to gain different insights?</p>

<h2>[Education] Computer Science, Biostatistics, Health Informatics – best for biomedical data science?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(123)">View full post</button><div id="123" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>tl;dr – Trying to choose a master’s program to do research in data science, in a biomedical/clinical context. Options are health informatics, biostatistics, and computer science.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! I graduated with my bachelor’s in Biomedical Sciences this past spring, and have been exploring career options since then, including working at a clinical job, a research job, and self-learning programming/advanced math.</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize I enjoy specific aspects from each experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data visualization: I enjoy analyzing and communicating research visually, pulling from background courses in biostatistics and graphic design.</li>
<li>Research methodology: I noticed that the subject matter didn’t matter (ranging from cell biology to public health), but rather I take interest in how research is structured and designed, and how other computational methods could be applied (e.g. drawing from my science background to see how predictive machine learning can be used in biomedical imaging, epidemiology, etc.)</li>
<li>Clinical component: I’d still like to have a clinical/healthcare approach to things, e.g. not closing doors on the (pipedream of an) idea of being a clinician-scientist of sorts</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, an ideal career of mine would consist of collaborating with various physicians and research groups. This includes working on designing research projects, applying statistical and computational methods for data analysis, and ultimately visually illustrating and communicating the results of the research (e.g. for the public and/or to other researchers).</p>

<p>Does such a career exist? I’m looking into Masters’ programs to explore the subject matter further, but it seems to be an intersect between computer science, biostatistics, and health informatics. What seems most appropriate from my experience/interests, alongside finding a job afterward?</p>

<p>Some side thoughts/notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Health informatics was the first thing I came across. Programs I’m looking at are 2 years with internships included. However, they seem more focused solely on management and policy of electronic health records (versus software development or data science), and I’m not too sure how this would translate out to other data science industries in the case I’m needing to pivot fields? Plus, a fair amount of the job descriptions also consider candidates in statistics and CS, but not the other way around</li>
<li>Biostatistics programs are 1-2 years long and some also have internships. They focus more on statistical theory alongside other public health concepts. However, I’ve also read that pure statistics might be more theory than I actually need, versus the software skills which data science employers look for?</li>
<li>Computer science programs are 2 years long, but I’d be finding internships on my own. Computer science is the least familiar of the fields to me, so I don&#39;t know how relevant the skills are in this program to my interests.</li>
</ul>
