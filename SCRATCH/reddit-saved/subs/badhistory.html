<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So one day I found myself arguing with a fairly typical &#39;ratheist&#39;, and the conversation turned to the Council of Nicaea. He was trying to convince me that Nicaea was &quot;where the Bible was rebooted, in a manner of speaking&quot; and that &quot;Until then, Jesus was just a prophet.&quot;</p>

<p>But this thread is not about that conversation. This thread is about <a href="http://www.livescience.com/2410-council-nicea-changed-world.html">the link he provided as &#39;proof&#39;</a>.</p>

<p>For starters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That summer [of 325 A.D.], 318 bishops from across the empire were invited to the Turkish town of Nicea, where Constantine had a vacation house, in an attempt to find common ground on what historians now refer to as the Arian Controversy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, all 1800 bishops of the church were invited. Only 318 of them actually attended. This was an time, after all, when travel from one corner of the empire to the other took months. (According to <a href="http://orbis.stanford.edu/">Stanford&#39;s map of travel in ancient Rome</a>, the fastest trip from Corduba to Nicaea would have taken over two months).</p>

<p>Second, &quot;Turkish&quot;? Really? Nicaea is located in modern-day Turkey, sure, but before that it was a Byzantine metropolis, a Roman provincial capital, and a Greek colony. The Turks were still roaming the Central Asian steppes when the council was held, and wouldn&#39;t put their name on Asia Minor for another thousand years at least.</p>

<p>Third, &quot;vacation home&quot;? The author refers to the &#39;Senatus Palace&#39;, Constantine&#39;s imperial residence and center of government for the province of <em>Bithynia et Pontus</em>, as a &quot;vacation home&quot;? I wouldn&#39;t be nearly as appalled if the author hadn&#39;t doubled down, calling it a &quot;lake house&quot; a few paragraphs later.</p>

<p>But, to be honest, all of this is merely place-setting and appetizers for the real badhistory main dish:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christian doctrine at the time was muddled and inconsistent, especially when it came to the central question of Jesus&#39; relationship to God. Jesus was as eternally divine as the Father, said one camp led by the Archbishop Alexander of Alexandria. Another group, named the Arians after their leader Arius the preacher, saw Jesus as a remarkable leader, but inferior to the Father and lacking in absolute divinity.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In a savvy move that would put today&#39;s shrewd politicians to shame, the compromise proffered by Constantine was vague, but blandly pleasing: Jesus and God were of the same &quot;substance,&quot; he suggested, without delving too much into the nature of that relationship. A majority of the bishops agreed on the compromise and voted to pass the language into doctrine.</p>

<p>Their statement of compromise, which would come to be known as &quot;The Nicene Creed,&quot; formed the basis for Christian ideology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Just wow. I can&#39;t say where the author got her history, or her theology, but that&#39;s about as flatly wrong as it is possible to be.</p>

<p>There is nothing &quot;vague but blandly pleasing&quot; in using the term &#39;consubstantial&#39;. It wasn&#39;t even a compromise. Arianism was completely and utterly routed, and Arius and his few followers were excommunicated (and Arius himself exiled) as heretics.</p>

<p>Now for the details. The dispute in the Council was expressed in a technical dispute over Aristotelian metaphysics. The Greek term in question was <em>ousia</em> -- variously translated &quot;form,&quot; &quot;being,&quot; &quot;essence,&quot; and most commonly in this context, &quot;substance.&quot;</p>

<p>Think of it this way: right now, you&#39;re probably sitting in a chair. The chair might be made of wood, or plastic, or metal. It might be in one of a hundred different shapes, thousands of possible sizes. Yet whatever the details, it remains distinctly a <em>chair</em>. Its &quot;substance,&quot; in the metaphysical sense, is the very &quot;chair-ness&quot; that lets us speak of a category of thing called &quot;chairs&quot; despite all the differences between each individual chair that we&#39;ve ever personally seen or sat upon.</p>

<p>There were three main factions in the Council of Nicaea.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Arians, led by Arius himself, argued that Jesus and the Father were <strong><em>heteroousia</em></strong> or <em>anomoios</em> -- which means &quot;unlike&quot; or &quot;differing in substance.&quot; They argued that God the Father possessed a fully divine nature, but that Jesus (&#39;the Son&#39;) possessed something else entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a splinter group of Semi-Arians who favored the term <strong><em>homoiousia</em></strong> -- which means &quot;similar in substance.&quot; This was a rather amorphous position that argued that, while Jesus and the Father didn&#39;t quite possess the same nature, they didn&#39;t have different natures, and that while Jesus wasn&#39;t quite equal to God, he was basically kinda &#39;God-like...&#39; yeah. This didn&#39;t sway many bishops at the Council and was pretty thoroughly shot down. It wasn&#39;t until after the Council, after pure Arianism had been declared anathema, that many former Arians picked up this argument, to try to smuggle their former position into Christian doctrine under this mantle.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally there was the anti-Arian faction, led by Athanasius &#39;the Great&#39; of Alexandria and supported by the vast majority of bishops at the Council. Athanasius argued that Jesus and God the Father were <strong><em>homoousia</em></strong> -- that is, &quot;same in substance&quot; or &quot;consubstantial.&quot;  In other words, Jesus and the Father share the same divine nature, the same &#39;what-ness&#39; that makes them both fully and equally God.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When the Council of Nicaea approved the use of <em>homoousia</em> in the Nicene Creed, it was not rubber-stamping a &quot;vague but blandly pleasing&quot; compromise proposed by a savvy (and theologically evasive) Emperor. &quot;Consubstantial&quot; was not vague, not bland, and not at all pleasing to the Arian bishops whose doctrine was declared anathema. &quot;Consubstantial&quot; was as precise a term as the Council of Nicaea could possibly have used to oppose Arian teachings.</p>

<h2>6 reasons why you should read history books and view professional lectures instead of following YouTube history channels</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>I&#39;m not writing this post to criticize a certain channel, or to discourage people from visual learning, or to discourage people whom do not want to dive deep into history and just stay at the gates</p>

<p>In fact, Visual learning is one of my favorite methods to learn, if done right. and there are some fascinating channels out there that does its best, but people need to get their ideas about history right. and use it wisely, History is a very sensitive matter, specially if it has projections on our modern day life. </p>

<p>History can be used to build bridges, but some others use it to build walls. so even if you need to just accumulate an amateur knowledge about it. you need to do it right so as not to get wrong conclusions. here is why you should take History channels on YouTube with a big grain of salt</p>

<h1>#1 History is not about battles and Generals</h1>

<p>History often gets shortened into Political history, the study of political and national aspects of nations, even this political history gets shortened into strategy, wars, battles and generals. more focused about elites and nobles, not the entire nations</p>

<p>of course ancient politics and wars are indispensable part of studying history. but it is neither the only nor the most important, there is cultural history, religious history, technological history, societal and economical history, archaeology and engineering. even morals, laws and norms through the ages are studied within history too</p>

<p>there is little-to-no interest in these areas while they are the most important reasons why people study history. it&#39;s all battles and politics, and basically i can&#39;t blame these channels. they make money from subscriptions. catchy history is necessary for them.  </p>

<h1>#2 no one cares about sources</h1>

<p>it is not that most of these channels ignore using sources (though some of them do), but when they do, they mostly use sources from one author, with a single perspective, without bothering to refer to the accountability of the author among academics, or even mentioning the sources for you to check (hint: it&#39;s mostly Wikipedia). some of them makes ads in a subtle way for online courses so that you get the impression that this is their main sources. when you check it, you will find what they say is different.</p>

<p>i won&#39;t even dare to mention archaeological evidences, no one cares about silly excavation</p>

<h1>#3 unlike lectures and books, you don&#39;t know much info about the owners of these channels</h1>

<p>This is important, and mostly forgotten. when you get a book, you read their Curriculum in the foremost of the book. so you get the idea of the accountability of this person. when you view a lecture, you know which university that hosts that, thus you get an idea about how reliable it can be.</p>

<p>however, in most cases, this is not true for history channels, some of them are completely anonymous, without any chance to know what progress they did in studying history, what are their degrees, what are even their names, Do they even know how researching is done? what do i have in hand as a fan to trust what they say? </p>

<h1>#4 details are not so &#39;clickbaity&#39;</h1>

<p>usually, you can know a pro from an amateur when it comes to details. many events in history requires a lot of details and backgrounds and even backgrounds to the backgrounds. it&#39;s not that people decided that &quot;hey guys, let&#39;s go kill each other!&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s do that!&quot; </p>

<p>like nowadays, there are so many factors and so many details usually get ignored in the middle. because at the end of the day, you want to explain some history in 10 minutes, you have to cut from here and from there and focus on the event itself. and sometimes it delivers the wrong impression about it</p>

<p>to best demonstrate this, i have to use an example, imagine explaining that the Syrian civil war happened because of the US and Russia</p>

<p>this statement needs so much clarification in addition to the fact that this is not entirely true, but this is how some channels deal with discussing events from the past </p>

<h1>#5 historical details are susceptible to change, sometimes entirely</h1>

<p>most people imagine that history is a definite, closed source material, and there is no room in it for new data and renewing (or even rewriting) what we previously knew about the past. it&#39;s a story that we only need to verify according to newbies</p>

<p>specially in the very ancient histories, there are huge uncertainty about data either due to lack of artifacts, or sources, or even mentioning. and some events do have theories that are equally possible, almost everyone fill the gaps with his own words that fits the story, even though this might have never happened</p>

<p>the youtube history channels often deals with the material we have in hand on the even as definite, thus making their narration sounds like an amusing movie in which we know the details for sure. even for things we are certain of. there is no room for possibilities with them </p>

<p>it&#39;s much like science, new archaeological data can make you change everything you know about something</p>

<h1>#6 bias</h1>

<p>Humans form opinions, and part of these opinions include philosophies, thoughts, ideologies and religious beliefs, no one is safe from the vice of taking sides in history, so it&#39;s important for the one who receives data to be aware that bias is almost unavoidable. so eventually, everyone has to form their knowledge in history through various sources. </p>

<p>this can be vital in other reasons too because, with anonymity, political and national biases play a role in the message some channels deliver. specially when talking about modern history (like WWII), so it&#39;s important not to let your knowledge exclusive from one place. you will eventually mislead yourself</p>

<h1>Edit: you can consider it #7 too.</h1>

<p>wars are dealt with in history channels as a game, something exotic that everyone should pay attention to. actually, it was the exceptions even in the past, and people back then tried to avoid wars too. no one is happy about a mass killing event. the way wars introduced in these channels feels like an exotic experience for fans whom never been into one, other than how it should be introduced, a horrible development of events. maybe this jingoist attitude towards war either feeds fans a jingoist agenda about history in general or just a way to attract followers through clickbait policy</p>
