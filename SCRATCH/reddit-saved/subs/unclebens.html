<p>Few edits : Buying a syringe skips the Spore Print step, you probably only need about .75 CC per bag, I’d recommend Shroom Scout’s ‘hole punch’ and ‘Capri sun’ methods for inoculation but both work great, and buy coco coir from a pet store! Good luck :)</p>

<h2>My first grow yielding 10+ mason jars and what I learned (some basic tips for first timers and science)</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(805)">View full post</button><div id="805" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I purchased a 10ml syringe from a website and 6 1 lb bags of rye berry bags from Etsy. Each bag got a a little less an a ml of syringe a was shaken, taped over the hole and set to spawn for a few weeks. When the bags were almost inoculated I broke it all apart, shook and allowed for a few days to spawn the rest. </p>

<p>For the bulk substrate I used equal parts of year old horse manure, coco coir, and vermiculite. I through in a tbs of gypsum powder(idk the efficacy). Sterilized it in the oven. I think 170 F for a few hours did the trick. Allowed to cool, mixed with the spawn in a sterilized tub and left to germinate the bulk substrate. </p>

<p>I apologize if this is common knowledge but I couldn’t find it before my first grow and here’s the basics. </p>

<p>You need your tub to be sealed, in a dark area to allow the tub to turn into a white brick of mycelium. It can chill like this for quite some time. In nature, this would be like mushrooms under dirt until they eventually send a strand to the surface which causes a mushroom to grow. </p>

<p>The addition of light and oxygen on the mycelium is what causes pins, and ultimately mushrooms to form. Moisture is important here, stale air will aid mold grown. It’s not the end of the world, just increase air flow and decrease humidity till it recedes. </p>

<p>Adding heat to the spawning substrate increases mushroom growth up to 80F then it becomes detrimental. More temp means better environment for bacteria to grow. </p>

<p>Ratios in the substrate don’t make too big of a difference. This isn’t a super exact science. You need a clean( anally clean is not necessary) area and growing medium. Life wants to find a way</p>

<p>Mushrooms spoil with moisture, heat and light. I store mine in not super packed jars with 2 desiccant packets each in my cabinet. </p>

<p>All in all, I ended up with 10 ish jars. I had a lot of fun, second time will not be nearly as nerve racking. </p>

<p>If you have a critique to my modified tek, lmk</p>

<p>Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk, hope this helped someone 🙂</p>

<p>EDIT: so there’s one thing I’m still debating. After my first flush the pinning of mushrooms slowed on the top of the substrate. I think because spores and mold coated the top of the mycelium preventing pinning. There was a dark layer on top of the whole brick, looked like it was suffocating any pins that came to the surface. Things only grew from the sides of the container once the top was covered. I contemplated slicing off the top of the brick to expose fresh mycelium but I had so many mushrooms that I didn’t bother. </p>

<p>They just keep on coming for at least a month from time of first pinning </p>

<p>Pinning on the sides and bottom of the tub is a bitch to deal with. By no means I survived and only lost one or two mushrooms (I also for a few days left the tub alone with just a tiny breathing hole and a puddle of water on the bottom because I went on vacation and no one to watch the mushrooms. Came back and still got another jar the next week 🤷‍♂️. Do your due diligence to keep the sides dark.</p>

It holds ten quart jars, my preferred method of rye sterilization for syringe inoculation AND G2G. Dont let newbies tell you dif. Rye berries soaked in a weak coffee, water, and one pinch of gypsum then brought to just a boil while stirring and then turning off the burner, let cool a minute, Then load the jars and PC. This method is far from new. These rye berries will produce the strongest cubes and pans imo. And dont trust all these YouTube vids. Read Roger Rabbits book.
