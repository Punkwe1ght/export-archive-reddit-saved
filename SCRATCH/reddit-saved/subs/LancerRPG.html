<h2>What is HA theme?</h2>

<p>Like, IPSN is the one with the most military feel, their mechs are Very straight foward, durable and they like to fight.</p>

<p>SSC are obviously oriental themed, with lots of stealth and assassination, they would rather have any form of defense except being tanky.</p>

<p>Horus is mythology themed and they&#39;re either a hacker plataform or doing something weird.</p>

<p>HA Just seens to be tanky and have geometrical desing. But I can&#39;t see a phylosophy that translates into their gameplay for most of the mechs.</p>
