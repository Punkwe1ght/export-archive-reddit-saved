<h3>The Dragon Ball holders and their storylines</h3>

<p>Now for a TL;DR recap of everything that&#39;s happened so far...</p>

<p><strong>Goichi &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/go13151">GO1</a>&quot; Kishida</strong> | <em>Local Scene</em>: Osaka, Japan | <em>Sponsor</em>: Cyclops Osaka</p>

<p>GO1 enters the DBFZ finals with the 3 star ball and the well-deserved title of anime legend - as of 2019, he has been competing in and winning fighting game tournaments for over a decade. A music gamer turned fighting gamer, GO1 first made a name for himself in Melty Blood with his earliest recorded Ws dating back to 2009. He was a god in that game - and other anime titles as well - known for his amazing defense that even <a href="https://twitter.com/HellaBrett/status/974805801205317633">gave Melty&#39;s developers problems</a>.</p>

<p>GO1 started traveling overseas and attended his first EVO in 2015. That weekend, he won a total of 4 anime side tournaments - Melty, Aquapazza, UNIEL, and Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax. In 2016, he started competing in Street Fighter 5, placing 4th at EVO and 7th at Capcom Cup that year. At that time, he was also playing Guilty Gear, KOF, BBCF, and even dabbling in Marvel.</p>

<p>The January 2018 release of DBFZ saw GO1 truly become a household name. For four entire months, he was <em>unbeatable</em>. GO1 himself began the storyline that would define the beginning of competitive DBFZ: he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mixupnight/clip/PleasantBlindingWatermelonSoonerLater">challenged SonicFox</a>, the dominant American player. Their first meeting at Final Round was one of the most hyped up and <a href="https://twitter.com/ATLfinalround/status/973234940547620864">event-ized</a> matches in FGC history - a real life Battle of the Gods. To the surprise of few who had followed GO1&#39;s career, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KimaiR1xHY">won by a landslide</a>, then took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt7I0P2KzpI&amp;t=1864s">the tournament</a> 2 days later. And the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66h6dI-UfVA">Blue Hallway</a> exhibition. </p>

<p>GO1 reigned supreme until Combo Breaker, where he finally took an L to SonicFox&#39;s new team, which Fox specifically put together to crack GO1&#39;s defense. Even after that, GO1 continued to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk7O75MpglU">deliver the hype</a> and consistently place top 4 at every tournament he entered. As the fates would have it, his rivalry vs SonicFox took center stage at the Grand Finals of EVO. </p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, GO1 traveled to UFA and secured his spot in the world tour finals by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01tK5NT-FY">coming back on HookGangGod</a> after a bracket reset. GO1 has since been taking it easy in tournaments due to his tendinitis. He is currently training his new team of Piccolo/Bardock/SSJ Goku. His recent break by no means indicates he&#39;s &quot;washed up&quot; as some stream monsters say - after a whole year of DBFZ competition, the number of players who have taken a tournament set off GO1 can still be counted on one hand.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Dominique &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/sonicfox5000">SonicFox</a>&quot; McLean</strong> | <em>Local scene</em>: New York, NY | <em>Sponsor</em>: Echo Fox</p>

<p>SonicFox is to American fighting games as GO1 is to anime. It would still be a little disingenuous to peg SonicFox as any one type of fighting game player, because he plays <em>all</em> subgenres of fighting games - 1v1, versus, anime, and 3D. Not only does he play multiple fighting games at the highest level, he dominates multiple fighting games at the highest level. At age 20, he is already a 4 time EVO champion with titles in 3 different games, and that doesn&#39;t include the side tournaments he&#39;s won. Fox has become somewhat of a controversial figure since he&#39;s so adept at pushing buttons both in and out of fighting games; however, two things can&#39;t be denied: he&#39;s deservedly on a shortlist of fighting game GOATs, and the FGC would be much less interesting without him in it.</p>

<p>Fox&#39;s FGC story began in 2013, when at age 14, he started to draw the ire of the NRS community for completely taking over Injustice: Gods Among Us tournaments. He got his first EVO win in IGAU in 2014 and then continued his NRS dominance all throughout Mortal Kombat X&#39;s lifespan - he added two more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca7NrAXcEXQ">EVO titles</a>, 3 ESL championships, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2i--tikO9w">13-0 money match victory</a> against Perfect Legend to his resume. While NRS titles were his main games, he also competed in tournaments for UNIEL, Dead or Alive, and Skullgirls. In time, his dominance in Skullgirls grew as strong as his dominance in NRS titles - his primary competition was dekillsage, now his current teammate and DBFZ training partner. Fox also became a top 5 MvCI player in 2017. </p>

<p>Fox was unstoppable at DBFZ locals upon the game&#39;s release; his Black/Hit/16 team ran a train through everyone. Chris G was the first person to pose a threat to him, taking a set off of him at Winter Brawl, but Fox ran it back in losers and <a href="https://youtu.be/VQPNVWzaI7A?t=7958">6-0&#39;d him in Grand Finals</a>. He enthusiastically accepted GO1&#39;s challenge, but come Final Round, he found himself thoroughly outclassed for the first time in his entire fighting game career. Fox, no stranger to maining the entire roster of every fighting game he plays, dropped his entire team and picked up a new one. He came back stronger than ever at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_9sHGo_ew4">Combo Breaker</a> and became the first person to ever defeat GO1. At last, he silenced the detractors who claimed that Fox only won games with &quot;no competition&quot;.</p>

<p>His Cell/Kid Buu/Gotenks team still had a tough time against certain players, so following losses at CEO and Summit, Fox dropped his entire team yet again and prepped a new squad for VSFighting and EVO - Bardock/Zamasu/Android 16. Developing the Bardock/16 shell paid off - he won the second Dragon Ball at VSFighting and capped off his storied rivalry with GO1 by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvENi3el5w">winning EVO</a> following a controversial-yet-legal side switch.</p>

<p>After EVO, he tried out several new characters with the Bardock/16 shell and ultimately found success with the first character he was known for using - Hit, who had long been written off as low tier by almost everyone except Fox himself. With that team, he was finally able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnOOzGs7rRo">halt Kazunoko&#39;s post-EVO win streak</a>. He&#39;s taking that team with him to the finals - he has yet to lose a tournament with it.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Ryota &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/kazunoko0215">Kazunoko</a>&quot; Inoue</strong> | <em>Local scene</em>: Tokyo, Japan | <em>Sponsor</em>: Godsgarden</p>

<p>When Kazunoko enters a fighting game tournament, it&#39;s not a question of &quot;will he get a top 8 medal?&quot; rather, it&#39;s a question of &quot;how many top 8 medals will he get?&quot; Since 2008, Kazunoko has been making a name for himself in multiple fighting games, namely Guilty Gear and Street Fighter. Like SonicFox and GO1, he&#39;s a true multi-game and multi-subgenre champion - while he focuses on his main games, he plays others on the side such as Marvel and BBTag. </p>

<p>The crowning achievement of his fighting game career thus far is probably his victory at Capcom Cup 2015, where he took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHB2umnbImU">Grand Finals</a> over Daigo. His Yun is so iconic that many DBFZ commentators still make references to it while watching his Yamcha. In 2016-2017, he did very well in his two main games, GG Xrd and SFV, getting 3rd at Capcom Cup 2016 and top 8 in GG at EVO 2 years in a row.</p>

<p>Kazunoko picked up DBFZ as a 3rd main game in 2018. He was always a top player and a lock for top 8, even back during Final Round when he played A Gohan/Goku Black/Vegeta. However, like absolutely every other DBFZ player, he was overshadowed by the GO1/SonicFox rivalry that was the focus of tournaments for the first 5 months of the game&#39;s lifespan. </p>

<p>The May patch brought a nerf to Vegeta&#39;s assist, and Kazunoko made a gutsy team change: he picked up Yamcha, a very off-meta character who was seen as nothing but an assist. The new Kid Buu/A Gohan/Yamcha team did decently well at Combo Breaker, pretty good at the Summit of Power (who can forget the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMu9R2lc-Go">solo Yamcha comeback</a> on dekillsage?), and finally at CEO a couple of weeks later, it destroyed everyone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIgN4fe7G6w">GO1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WRW0RXgsQ">SonicFox</a> looked lost as they got caught by Yamcha again and again. Kazunoko won his first big major and his first Dragon Ball. </p>

<p>After the August patch, Kazunoko switched his point character from Kid Buu to Gotenks. He won TWFighter. He won <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBcAPw9MOLg">SCR</a>. He won <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgKI5VtodLs">SEAM</a>(Dragon Ball #2). He won all of his locals and most of his casual sets. He was so dominant that fellow Tokyo player Acqua made an anti-Kazunoko club.</p>

<p>Although SonicFox finally broke his winning streak at Canada Cup, Kazunoko&#39;s gatekeeping was far from done. He picked up right where he left off, winning the 6 star ball at the Japan saga and the 7 star ball at Couch Warriors Crossup. Thanks to Kazunoko winning 4 of the 7 saga events, there will be 4 single elimination LCQ tournaments. Kazunoko might enter all of them wearing a fake mustache and an alias just because he can, but hopefully he decides to leave some tournaments for everyone else to win and we&#39;ll just see him on Sunday. No matter how much whining there is about his cheap Gotenks/A Gohan/Yamcha team, remember that he pioneered the team, and he is <em>by far</em> the best at playing it. </p>

<p><strong>Eduardo &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/hookganggod">HookGangGod</a>&quot; Deno</strong> | <em>Local scene</em>: New York, NY | <em>Sponsor</em>: NRG</p>

<p>Unlike the other 3 finalists, HookGangGod is a newcomer to the FGC. DBFZ is the first game he traveled to offline events for, and that makes his accomplishments all the more impressive. </p>

<p>Hook did decently well in his tournament debut at Winter Brawl, getting 17th place, but stream monsters began to take notice of him following a streak of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdL0YFtxLOo">very strong NLBC performances</a> (and being the #1 guy in ranked doesn&#39;t hurt). While SonicFox was taking a break from locals, Hook showed up and mopped up the competition. His laid back demeanor and unique team, starring the supposedly low tier Piccolo, immediately earned him many loyal Twitch subscribers, while his results earned him a sponsorship from NRG.</p>

<p>Hook&#39;s initial win streak didn&#39;t last forever, as SonicFox eventually returned to NLBC and demonstrated how to deal with Hellzone on wakeup. Still, Hook came to play week after week, gradually improving and getting rid of his online habits. He consistently made top 8s, but his true breakout performance came at the Summit of Power, where he won very exciting sets against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsca4JgVq0c">GO1</a> and his tournament demon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54qOOFrSBAY">SonicFox</a>. Two months later, he secured the 4 star ball and his ticket to the finals at Thunderstuck in Mexico.</p>

<p>After a long break from offline tournaments, Hook took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRPWqB2MrWU">Frosty Faustings</a> with Piccolo/Bardock/Vegeta. Hook&#39;s team has been relatively consistent throughout the life of DBFZ - Piccolo, SSJ &quot;the bf&quot; Vegeta, and current meta character to hold the shell together. He plans to use that team to loop some assholes at the finals this Sunday.</p>
