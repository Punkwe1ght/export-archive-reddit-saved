<p>A strong strategy is to use otters in the early game to buff one pet over and over, usually another tier 1 pet. You&#39;ll learn how to manage this effectively the more you try it and see what works. Scaling tends to be very good in this game, so otter, giraffe, rabbit, penguin, bison, monkey, cow, seal, dragon, and black cat are all worth playing around with to see if you can make them work. There&#39;s no one-size-fits-all technique though, scalers (or anything else) aren&#39;t an &quot;always pick.&quot; The value of different pets will always change based on what&#39;s going on in your particular run.</p>

<p>The more you play, the more you think about the trade-offs. Should I buy this swan to get income for the future, or are my stats struggling so much that I need the 3/8 crab and meat instead to survive the next couple rounds? Every decision affects every other decision, so you can always dig deeper if you want to make a more informed choice. What/when to freeze and how long, whether or not to buy food or roll for a shot at duplicates or better stuff, what&#39;s the right order for my team and has that changed since last round, does such-and-such pet fit with what&#39;s going on or pave the way for a strong future set up, is the thing I&#39;m trying to do coming too late in the rounds or not, what can I do if the best pet for my needs doesn&#39;t show up, etc.</p>

<p>Tons of rounds are won or lost by a single health or close to it. Small optimizations pay off greatly in this game, so it&#39;s worth figuring out the minutia of how the game mechanics and interactions work, no matter how tiny. There are lots of kooky little details to explore.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to get good at SAP by reading tier lists or basic advice on the internet. Probably your best bet is looking for streamers who play really well and seeing how they think about the game. Of course, nothing beats your own experimentation and analysis. That&#39;s the fun part anyways IMO.</p>

<h2>I know these games are MAINLY RNG, but when do you sell your tier 1s and when do you keep them?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(477)">View full post</button><div id="477" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Played auto battlers before, this one’s definitely unique so having a little trouble getting past 5th round usually. </p>

<p>I know every game is different, but if I keep getting tier 1s for an easy level 3, I should take it right? Even if later I get later tiers, should I keep the level 3 tier 1s?</p>

<p>When do you sell? </p>

<p>I understand synergies and builds, I’ve played auto battlers before, but I see conflicting strategies saying to sell for the higher tiers when you can, but I’ve seen plenty when I vs them having level 3 pigs, crickets, fish, or ants and wrecking me lol.</p>

<p>My instinct would be, if I keep getting repeat pets, then focus on level 3? Never sell if my level 3 is past a certain attack and defense like 10+ or 15+ or is there ever a time you’d sell your highest attack and defense guy or should you just focus everything on your early level 3 if you get lucky and build around them?</p>

<p>I’ve seen guides but they’re always tips like about the archetypes and tips about SPECIFIC builds but I have difficulty finding how to effectively transition into later tiers and when to sell my pets or keep and buff a tier 1.</p>

<p>Sorry if I repeated myself a bit lol. If you have some tips and/or videos focused on transitions and working with what you got, lemme know please :)</p>
