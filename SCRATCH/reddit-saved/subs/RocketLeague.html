    <p>After playing Rocket League for a couple of days, I still suck. But as I am very competitive in anything I do, I wanted to talk about training routines.</p>

<p><strong>One major tip I can give you:</strong> training is actually just solidifying muscle memory and neural connections in your brain. This process cannot distinguish between &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; outcomes. What this means is that training only works when you succeed in over 50% of your tries. 
This means you should stop doing that all-star aerial training where you get 20% score, and start going back to that pro striker training where you generally score about 70%. Keep in mind I am purely talking about muscle memory and reflex training here, which is separate from internalizing knowledge. </p>

<p><strong>Two free play training routines I picked up:</strong>
1) Alternately hitting the ball with the front and back of the car to improve ball handling to improve your control of backwards driving.
2) Keeping your car in the air while flying a circle around the pitch following the stadiums walls to improve aerial control.</p>

<p><strong>Two tips for improving immediately:</strong> 1) Turn off your ball-cam before you take your shot. The ball cam is useful for not losing track of the ball, but with ball cam off, your whole screen will move when you adjust your aim instead of only your car, so it&#39;s visually easier to align your shot.
2) Play duels. During duels the result of every shot you take and every save you make is immediately clear. As such, feedback is much clearer and you&#39;ll learn faster.</p>

<p>Have you guys developed any other training routines that might help me in return?</p>
