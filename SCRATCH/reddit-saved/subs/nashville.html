<div class="md"><p>You pretty much nailed it. You&#39;ve got the right coffee shops.</p>

<p>Here are some alternatives if you&#39;d like:</p>

<p>Indian: Bombay Palace (has meat options, and slightly better tasting food IMO. Close to Woodlands)</p>

<p>Burgers: Burger Up (has some innovative burgers and good ambiance)</p>

<p>Gourmet middle-eastern: Epice (&lt;-- must try)</p>

<p>You got Marche right for brunch, but check out Tavern if you can. The wait can be quite long because the food is good. Or, Fido if you are feeling like having brunch any time during the day any day of the week. And good coffeeshop ambiance.</p>

<p>Bars:</p>

<p>I&#39;d lose Pinewood. </p>

<p>Try 2 Bits. Tons of free games (all sorts: from arcade to console to board) And its adjacent bars on Demonbreun.</p>

<p>Try Tavern. And its adjacent bars in Midtown (Broadway Brewhouse, Red Door...very close to Patterson&#39;s. You can walk after a drink at Pattersons)</p>

<p>12 South Taproom, for when you need a nice place to drink good beer in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Belcourt Taps. For good burgers and beer with undiscovered live local music daily. Stone&#39;s throw from Fido. Bonus: catch a movie at Belcourt theater (double bonus: access to a full bar inside)</p>

<p>To do:</p>

<p>Take a tour of Corsair Artisan Distillery close to downtown (need to reserve ahead). Or breweries: Yazoo, Jackalope, Fat Bottom, Black Abbey. Definitely try our award winning Corsair Vanilla Gin. Tis the season for a GnT.</p>

<p>Around dusk, take a walk across the river near downtown on the pedestrian bridge. Bring a camera. There will be incredible views.</p>

<p>Visit art galleries on 5th Ave. If it&#39;s the first Saturday of the month, there is an art crawl that starts at 5ish and links all the galleries. They have free wine and music.</p>

<p>Visit the world&#39;s only life size replica of the Parthenon at Centennial Park.</p>

<p>Visit Franklin downtown for some historical architecture and artisan shops.</p>
