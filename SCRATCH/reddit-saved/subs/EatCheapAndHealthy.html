<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I needed to eat cheap and healthy for a long time because I was broke, but after being back in work for a while I decided I wanted a sous vide now that I could afford things like that again. The sous vide is great, but that&#39;s not a particularly cheap way to cook. The main take away from the whole thing is that I bought a vacuum food sealer for making things sous vide and also inadvertently changed the way I eat things.</p>

<p>It might seem kind of pointless. You might say you can do the same thing with tupperware or whatever but now I make all of my food for work weeks in advance, keep them in individually portioned bags in the freezer and just take out a mix of different meals for the week, lots of choice instead of eating that one big pot of chilli for the week. The food keeps for a very long time in the fridge and I&#39;ve read online that it can keep for literally years in the freezer.</p>

<p>I make everything in huge batches, seal and freeze them and whenever I or the missus don&#39;t feel like cooking, we&#39;ve got a freezer full of food that&#39;s very nearly as good as fresh. All for the fraction of the price of the micromeals you get from the store.</p>

<p>You can make all kinds of meals, I&#39;ve even made mini sunday roasts with gravy. All kinds of pasta work well, even ones you can eat cold like tuna and sweetcorn pasta. Curries work really well, as does chilli. I like making just regular chicken and veg bags too, veg stays really good this way. Rice and beans too.</p>

<p>The sealer I bought was a fancy one for £60 ($90) but you can get them as low as £40($60) but you can probably get cheaper if you shop around. I realise that&#39;s a lot of outlay but the convenience means I&#39;ve cut down on eating takeaway, I no longer buy lunch in work. I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably paid for itself in the nearly 2 month that I&#39;ve had it.</p>
