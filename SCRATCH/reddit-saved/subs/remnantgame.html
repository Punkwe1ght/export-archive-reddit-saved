<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p><em>(Italicised sections will generally be non-essential information that is more useful to beginner players who are new to Remnant&#39;s mechanics, and anyone wanting to understand my justifications for any opinions and biases about summoning build choices. Feel free to skip over them and get to the meat of each section if you&#39;re an experienced player and don&#39;t need everything explained).</em></p>

<p>Hi Remnant community. This is my first ever attempt at a build guide for any videogame, so please go easy on me. To date, I&#39;ve played just over 300 hours of Remnant across multiple builds. This build got me through all Story Mode difficulties even after the summoning nerfs, and my recent discovery that summons seem to be intentionally hitting weakspots gives even more incentive for players to try a summoning build. Although I haven&#39;t tried the build in hardcore, it has turned out to be quite tanky and low-risk; so I would assume it is probably hardcore-viable too (will confirm eventually).</p>

<p>A few things before I get started:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am Australian. Armour is not a typo.</li>
<li>If someone else has already made a similar build guide, I apologise for any accidental copying, and I am happy to acknowledge you in my guide. In an active community like this one, builds guides can start to overlap; but I haven&#39;t seen any up-to-date comprehensive summoning guides since the nerfs, and I&#39;d like to make that contribution to the community. This is as much a build guide as it is a collation of all the information about summoning that I have been able to pull together from hours of research over the course of making and playing the build.</li>
<li>I primarily play solo, and so my build will focus on the versatility necessary to survive without teammates. In a team setting, it may be more useful to specialise, or use team-based items (e.g. Mender&#39;s Charm to give the Elder Set buff to allies). Adjust the build accordingly if you are playing co-op. I may add some footnotes about co-op tweaks later.</li>
<li>There are a lot of general-purpose armours and trinkets with broadly applicable utility - they can be useful in any build, but they also don&#39;t define any build. I will only be mentioning items that specifically augment summoning, so don&#39;t take me not mentioning a general-purpose item as me saying it has no place in the build.</li>
<li>Do not use Curse of the Jungle God just because it&#39;s a boss weapon with a summon mod. In its current state, it is absolutely not worth taking up a weapon slot.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s get into the build!</p>

<h1>2. Choosing an Archetype:</h1>

<p><em>Ultimately, the choice is up to you since you can buy most archetype equipment immediately upon starting the game; but for a build like this, there&#39;s really no good reason to pick anything other than the Ex-cultist.</em></p>

<p><strong>Reasons to pick the Ex-Cultist:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Cultist armour set is a core part of the build due to its mod generation bonuses.</li>
<li>You get immediate access to the Spirit trait that you cannot buy if you choose a different archetype; instead, you have to get lucky and roll a specific mini-dungeon to obtain it (see &quot;Traits&quot; section for details).</li>
<li>Mender&#39;s Aura is a great all-purpose starting mod, especially for new players</li>
<li>But swap that damned coach gun out for a Hunting Rifle ASAP!</li>
</ul>

<h1>3. Weapons</h1>

<p><em>Non-boss ranged weapons are compulsory as we need empty mod sockets to equip summoning mods. Because we will not be using armour or trinkets to buff weapon damage or reload speeds, I prefer to use versatile weapons that have no significant shortcomings such as long reload times, short range, or small magazines. However, you can really choose any non-boss weapon that works for you.</em></p>

<p><strong>Recommended Long Guns:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Assault Rifle - One of the best jack-of-all-trades non-boss weapons in the game. Perfectly balanced for range, DPS, magazine size, and reload speed. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">completing Supply Run (Monkey Key mini-dungeon) in Sorrow&#39;s Field on Earth.</span></li>
<li>Hunting Rifle - In my opinion, this is the best starter weapon in the game, and can be taken through all content. Slightly less versatile than the Assault Rifle, but particularly useful for more open maps where you may start to feel the Assault Rifle&#39;s range drop off. Starting weapon for the Hunter, or can be purchased from Rigs in Ward 13 at the start of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recommended Hand Guns:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Submachine Gun - My personal favourite non-boss Hand Gun; although that&#39;s not saying much since the non-boss Hand Guns are pretty lacking overall. Covers close-range combat, pairing well with the Assault Rifle and Hunting Rifle. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">accessing the locked room on level B2 of Ward 13.</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">Use the Ward 13 Keycard to open the door on B2,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">grab the fuse from the room on the left at the end of the first hall,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">use it to open the door on B3,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">turn the fuse box back off to deactivate the fan on B3,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">grab the Ward 13 Master Key from the room behind the fan,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">return to B2 and go to the end of the second hallway,</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">use the Ward 13 Master Key to unlock the door at the top of the stairs, and the Submachine Gun will be on one of the tables in the room.</span></li>
<li>Magnum Revolver - Probably the only other viable non-boss Hand Gun for this build. You probably don&#39;t want to pair this with the Hunter Rifle as having two round-by-round reloading weapons can be tedious in a pinch. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">getting the Lucky Coin to randomly spawn on Earth, and then giving it to Ace.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Melee Weapon:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Butcher&#39;s Flail - Really the only viable melee weapon for this build, as the free Corrosive proc gives a nasty 15% damage boost from all sources, and is the only way to further buff summon damage using a melee weapon. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">alternate killing the Unclean One in the Butcher&#39;s Both on Corsus.</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">To get the alternate kill, sneak downstairs and interact with one of the giant pots until the screen fades to black and the Unclean One makes his way downstairs.</span></li>
</ul>

<h1>4. Armour</h1>

<p><em>Current armour options for summoning builds are very limited. In fact, I believe the Elder set is the only set that directly buffs summon damage; other sets that buff specific damage types and mod damage only affect the player. You can use defensive/utility pieces if you&#39;d prefer, but a lot of these will be pretty useless in higher difficulties without specific investment, and you will take a huge hit to your summon DPS.</em></p>

<p><strong>Essential Armour Sets:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Elder Set - Buffs all damage for 20 seconds after the player consumes a Dragon Heart. The only set actually capable of buffing summon damage in the entire game. Essential for the build - especially in higher difficulties. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">surviving the siege at Martyr&#39;s Sanctuary on Yaesha.</span></li>
<li>Cultist Set - Slowly generates mod power over time, increases the mod generation of all weapons, Mod generation helps to keep maximum summons up at all times, universal mod charge regardless of weapon use allows secondary weapon to be fully charged more often. Starting set for Ex-Cultist, or can be bought from Rigs in Ward 13.</li>
<li>In my opinion, a mix of 2 Elder set pieces, and 1 Cultist set piece is the ideal combination; as you&#39;re maximising the summon damage boost from the Elder set while maintaining the quality-of-life that comes with being able to build mod power for both of your summons faster and regardless of what weapon is being used. I find that one piece is enough to always have two charges on my Hand Gun mod without even having to use it. You can run full Elder set for maximum damage - especially if you are in a party - but you will need to be careful with your mod power.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Suggested Armour Combinations for Maximum Fashion:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Yaeshen Conjurer - Elder Headdress, Elder Raiment, Cultist Britches</li>
<li>Wandering Occultist - Elder Headdress, Cultist Duster, Elder Leggings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optional Armour Set:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adventurer Set - Good for gathering a large amount of resources early in the game. Keep equipped as long as the benefits of other armour sets are unnecessary for your difficulty. Tunic and leggings given at the start of the game, goggles earned by <span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating 5 bosses in a row in Survival Mode (requires Swamps of Corsus DLC).</span></li>
</ul>

<h1>5. Trinkets</h1>

<p><em>Again, trinket choices are fairly limited for a summoning build. There are currently only two trinkets that interact directly with summoning. Which trinket you choose will largely decide your ring choice and playstyle.</em></p>

<p><strong>Amulets:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Soul Anchor - Increases summon duration, and gives you a stacking melee and ranged damage buff for every summon you have active. Encourages keeping summons alive as long as possible, and combining summoning with gunplay. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">completing the Re-Animator event on Yaesha.</span></li>
<li>Vengeance Idol - Increases all damage (including summons) by 30% when the player is below 50% health. 50% health makes you extremely vulnerably - especially at higher difficulties. Encourages hiding or kiting while damage buffed summons take care of DPS. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">random spawn on Yaesha.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rings:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sagestone - 30% increased Trait Rank experience. Essential at the start of any build when you don&#39;t really need a second ring to survive. Grab it early to benefit from it. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">random spawn on Earth.</span></li>
<li>Soul Link - Recover 5% of minion damage as health. Makes you very tanky with sustained summon DPS. Well-suited to Soul Anchor. Incompatible with Vengeance Idol as it will keep putting you above the 50% health cut-off for the buff. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">spawning a Monolith in Rhom Adventure Mode and exploring the small cave beside the structure.</span></li>
<li>Celerity Stone - Increases consumable use speed, including Dragon Heart. Can make using your Dragon Heart to activate the Elder set buff a lot safer by shortening the animation time. Especially helpful if you haven&#39;t maxed the Glutton Trait yet. Useful with both Amulets. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">locating item (other than the Ricochet Rifle) on a corpse in the he Forgotten Undercroft on Yaesha.</span></li>
<li>Soul Ember - Reduces summon health to 60%, but adds an explosion on death/time out. Does not work for Seeker beetles, and so is only really useful on Rattle Weed and Seed Caller Root Hollows as they are the only summons to get close enough for the explosion to work. Well-suited to Vengeance Idol, and the damage buff affects the explosion too. Incompatible with Soul Anchor as your summons will constantly be dying long before they time out. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">destroying all of the hanging pods in the Circlet Hatchery on Corsus (I am unsure if this location only spawns in Adventure Mode with the Swamps of Corsus DLC, or if you can get it in Story Mode too).</span></li>
<li>Ring of Supremacy - Increases all damage by 20% when no damage has been taken for 5 seconds. <strong>WARNING:</strong> This interaction does not currently work, but will as of the next patch. Don&#39;t use it yet, but this will become a very powerful option for boosting summon damage as of next patch. Will presumably be useful with both amulets. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating either final boss on Yaesha in Hardcore Mode - Story Mode and Adventure Mode both count (a.k.a you can start a hardcore character, activate a Yaesha Adventure Mode, get the Ravager for your final boss, play the Ravager&#39;s lullaby to avoid the fight, and still get the ring as a reward).</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>You might be wondering which playstyle I think is better. There used to be a cool interaction between Vengeance Idol and Soul Ember where the HP reduction of Soul Ember would automatically proc Vengeance Idol&#39;s damage boost on summons, making them glass cannons with a more powerful explosion at the end while you could stay on full HP. Unfortunately, I checked and this no longer seems to be the case. But even if it was, Rattle Weed&#39;s taunt feels unreliable if enemies have already aggro&#39;d onto you (which they often have because stealth doesn&#39;t work very well); and even on root hollows, the explosions seem to be quite unreliable and not worth the hassle. Therefore,</em> <strong><em>IN MY OPINION</em></strong>, Soul Anchor is a superior choice, and the rest of this guide will focus primarily on a Soul Anchor playstyle. I will still briefly mention Vengeance Idol alternatives for if you&#39;re, y&#39;know, into &quot;that sort of thing&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Trinket Loadouts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Early-Game EXP Farming - Soul Anchor, Soul Link or Celerity Stone, Sagestone</li>
<li>Safe and Tanky - Soul Anchor, Soul Link, Celerity Stone</li>
<li>Damage-Focused - Soul Anchor, Soul Link, Ring of Supremacy (as of next patch)</li>
<li>Vengeance Idol Alternative - Vengeance Idol, Soul Ember, Ring of Supremacy (as of next patch)</li>
</ul>

<h1>6. Mods</h1>

<p><em>This may sound cliche, but each summon really does have its own purpose in the game, so rather than give you the two &quot;best&quot; ones, I&#39;m just going to talk about what each summon does, what function it serves, and what sort of situations you should use it in. Since my guide is focusing on Soul Anchor, we&#39;re going to be wanting to max out our possible summon count and keep that roster going whenever possible.</em></p>

<p><strong>Soul Anchor:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Iron Sentinel - Summons up to 2 static Turrets that fire hitscan projectiles. Excellent for blocking choke points and kiting in a single area. Equip to main weapon as you&#39;ll be needing to re-summon at each new fight location. Obtained by: <span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating the Vyr Construct outside Wud&#39;s shop on Rhom.</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">To activate the Vyr Construct, socket the Control Rod obtained from the Houndmaster and Maul boss fight.</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">To get the control rod, you must deal a significant amount of damage to the rod sticking out of the Houndmaster&#39;s head so that he is killed by a no longer controlled Maul, then kill Maul.</span></li>
<li>Seed Caller - Summons up to 2 root hollows that chase after enemies and use slow, powerful melee attacks. Equip to off-hand weapon as the root hollows follow you around and will not need to be constantly re-summoned. Cannot reach some bosses that stay out of the combat arena. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating the Mangler in the Tangled Pass on Earth.</span></li>
<li>Beckon - Summons up to 2 floating Wasteland Skulls that fire slow-moving, high damage ranged projectiles. In my opinion, a less versatile ranged summon damage option compared to Iron Sentinel due to the travel time of projectiles. However, still useful to double up with Iron Sentinel for extra ranged damage against slow-moving enemies that melee units cannot reach. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating Raze in the Lair of the Eyeless on Rhom.</span></li>
<li>Seeker - Summons up to 3 Beetles that follow the player until an enemy comes close, at which point they will rapidly move towards the enemy and blow themselves up, damaging the enemy. Not a great pairing with Soul Anchor as it becomes tedious to maintain all 3 Beetles just for 25% more bonus weapon damage. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">alternate killing Cessnya, the Iskal Queen in the Queen&#39;s Temple on Corsus in Adventure Mode.</span> <span class="md-spoiler-text">Just as you&#39;re about to make Cessnya transition from phase 1 to phase 2, make sure one of the large stalactites is between you and the queen. When she puts out her paralysing mist, wait for her to stand right beneath the stalactite, and shoot her to break the mist. While she is vulnerable, shoot at the stalactite until it breaks off from the roof of the cavern, impaling Cessnya and killing her instantly.</span></li>
<li>Rattle Weed - Summons up to 1 taunting Rattle Weed. Do not use this with Soul Anchor. You are screwing yourself out of a 25% of bonus ranged and melee damage. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">killing Shroud in the Hidden Sanctum/Tainted Well on Earth.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vengeance Idol:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Iron Sentinel and Beckon are pretty neutral in a Vengeance Idol build - not bad, but not exceptional either.</li>
<li>Seeker is well-suited to this playstyle as you can send Beetles out from behind cover, but bear in mind that Soul Ember will not proc if Seeker Beetles blow themselves up. Given that the Beetles don&#39;t proc Soul Ember, I have to wonder if they are even tagged as a summon or if they are considered a mod, as this would affect which traits they scale with etc. I plan to clarify this in the future by tracking Seeker damage as I level up Evocation and Invoker. If anyone else has already tested this, please let me know.</li>
<li>Seed Caller&#39;s Root Hollows are the best mobile summon for use with Soul Ember as they chase after enemies and increase the chances of explosions hitting.</li>
<li>Rattle Weed pairs well with Seed Caller when using Soul Ember as you can lure enemies and any pursuant Root Hollows to a single position, resulting in grouped up explosions hitting multiple enemies. However, you will be at the mercy of the Rattle Weed&#39;s inconsistent ability to taunt.</li>
<li>Given that Vengeance Idol&#39;s buff is not affected by summon count, technically you could throw in other useful mods like Song of Swords; but at that point you&#39;re barely playing a summoning build and you may as well just play something else.</li>
</ul>

<h1>7. Traits</h1>

<p><em>Given there&#39;s no Trait Rank cap and you can technically max out all traits on a single character, I thought it would be better to just rank traits into a few categories based on relevance to the build. I&#39;ve only included methods for obtaining essential traits or this section would balloon like crazy. Check the Wiki for how to obtain any non-essential traits.</em></p>

<p><strong>Essential:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Elder Knowledge and Scavenger - Max them out first so you can reap the benefits ASAP. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">playing the tape recorder in a side room of Ward 13 Floor B2 for Elder Knowledge, and giving the Tarnished Ring to Reggie for Scavenger.</span></li>
<li>Survivability traits - Anything related to health, stamina, and defences. Level as needed. All of these traits are either starter traits, or earned automatically throughout the story campaign.</li>
<li>Swiftness - Increases movement speed. As essential for any build as any other survivability trait, but max this one out ASAP because you&#39;re going to be doing a lot of kiting for your summons. Obtained by<span class="md-spoiler-text">playing 1-1-3-4-1-1-3-2 on any bell puzzle on Yaesha when labelling bells from left to right.</span></li>
<li>Invoker - Damage-boosting trait for summoning. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">killing 100 enemies with summons in a single playthrough.</span></li>
<li>Spirit - More mod power generation = more summons more often. Max quickly. Starter trait for Ex-Cultist, or obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">completing Supply Run (Monkey Key mini-dungeon) in Sorrow&#39;s Field on Earth.</span></li>
<li>Glutton - Faster consumable use. You&#39;ll be using your Dragon Heart all the time and the slow animation makes you incredibly vulnerable; so this trait is crucial. Obtained by<span class="md-spoiler-text">defeating the Unclean One.</span></li>
<li>Blood Bond - Defers up to 15% of damage dealt to you to your summons. Stacks with aggressor&#39;s bane for some nasty damage mitigation in higher difficulties. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">redeeming two Cryptolith Sigils at a Monolith in any Adventure mode.</span></li>
<li>Exploiter - Increases weakspot damage. <strong>WARNING:</strong> I am uncertain as to whether this boosts summon weakspot damage as by the time summons started hitting weakspots more often, I had already maxed the trait. I will update this when I have a chance to test it, or if someone is able to test it for me. Obtained by <span class="md-spoiler-text">killing 150 enemies with weakspot damage in a single playthrough.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Useful:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Catalyst - Increases your chance of getting a Corroded proc with your Butcher&#39;s Flail if you don&#39;t have time for a charged attack.</li>
<li>Rapid Strike - Increases melee speed. Faster melee attacks = more chances for a Corroded proc.</li>
<li>Arcane Strike - Helps with passively generating mod power from melee hits.</li>
<li>Concentration - Soul Anchor provides plenty of summon duration, but you can never have too much of a good thing, right?</li>
<li>Triage - Increased healing effectiveness. A good place to spend points at the end of the build; but you get plenty of healing from Soul Link, so it&#39;s only really useful on the highest difficulties.</li>
<li>Potency - Increases consumable duration. Synergises well with Triage. Also works on status-clearing consumables and extended buff consumables.</li>
<li>Mind&#39;s Eye, Trigger Happy, Quick Hands, Executioner, and Kingslayer - All of these traits boost weapon DPS in various ways, slightly increasing overall DPS and mod generation rate; but will not help your main source of damage.</li>
<li>Warrior - Increases melee damage. The Corroded proc is more important than the damage, but every little bit contributes to total DPS and mod generation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Multiplayer traits - Varying degrees of usefulness if you play co-op. Level accordingly.</li>
<li>Luminescent - Similar use to Scavenger and Elder Knowledge but for Lumenite Crystals. Only invest in this one if you&#39;re struggling to keep up with boss weapon upgrade material requirements.</li>
<li>Handling - I&#39;ve never needed this to control weapon kick, but take it if you&#39;re struggling to hit your targets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not Required:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Evocation - Boosts mod damage. Does not affect summons. Useless for this build since all mod slots are occupied by summons.</li>
<li>Footwork - Increases aim-down movement speed. So negligible that you should only be investing in this if you have nothing else to spend the points on.</li>
<li>Shadow Walker - Supposedly decreases enemy awareness range, but this has never seemed to do much for me and is useless in boss fights.</li>
<li>Sleight of Hand - Weapon swapping is almost instantaneous anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h1>8. Gameplay Tips</h1>

<p><em>Frankly, summoning feels like the most hastily implemented combat mechanic in the game; but this is not necessarily a bad thing, because hasty implementation results in some unexpected interactions that can be a lot of fun. I love janky but fun mechanics, and they give summoning a lot of unique situational utility.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Focus on getting all of your summons out and activating the Elder set buff ASAP before too many enemies have closed in on you. With Soul Anchor, your summons should last the duration of the fight, allowing you to focus on kiting and killing at full strength, rather than getting caught out in the middle of a summoning animation.</li>
<li>You can&#39;t dodge roll during the summoning animation; but you can sprint. This is why maxing Swiftness as early as possible is important. Always be sprinting while you are summoning to avoid damage to yourself, but also to reduce the chance of an AoE attack killing your summon as soon as it spawns.</li>
<li>Summons are susceptible to friendly fire. This is a good reason to use Iron Sentinel for most gameplay, as you can position Turrets on the edge of combat where you are less likely to accidentally shoot them. I do not believe that the Suspicious trait reduces this damage as it only affect damage dealt to the player, not the amount of damage done by the player to allies. If your heart is really set on using Vengeance Idol and Soul Ember, this mechanic allows you to pop summon explosions early - although you will be sacrificing the DPS of the unit itself, and reducing the power of the explosion.</li>
<li>Summons are also susceptible to enemy AoE damage, so don&#39;t summon anything right before a big attack from an enemy; and consider if you might be able to avoid an enemy&#39;s attacks altogether (e.g. summoning Wasteland Skulls with Beckon to avoid a ground AoE attack).</li>
<li>Iron Sentinel Turrets do not move and take up space. Because summons do not draw aggro from enemies, they can be placed in narrow choke points to block enemies enemies from entering, while you can dodge roll between the Turrets freely. This is especially useful for deadly enemies like Root Juggernauts, who can be corralled into a hallway and kited as you slowly whittle them down while avoiding return fire. Melee enemies with a charging animation (e.g. Root Hulks/Gorefist) will get stuck on the Turrets - locked into their charging animation, but never able to end the animation by attacking the player (devs, please don&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; this; summoning needs all the help it can get and it looks hilarious). Even in an open space, if you are luck enough to place two turrets very close to each other, and position one of these enemies correctly, you can lock them into place between the turrets without the need for a choke point.</li>
<li>Once Root Hollows have defeated any enemies around you, they will often begin to roam far away from you across the map seeking out the nearest enemy. Again, because summons cannot aggro enemies, this allows you to sit tight in a safe hiding place while your Root Hollows wreak havoc on your helpless enemies.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll add more as I think of them and people suggest them.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>9. Quick Start Guide</h1>

<ul>
<li>Choose the Ex-Cultist for your starting archetype.</li>
<li>Use versatile, non-boss weapons.</li>
<li>2x Elder set pieces, 1x Ex-Cultist set piece for armour.</li>
<li>Soul Anchor &gt; Vengeance Idol.</li>
<li>Swap between Soul Link, Celerity Stone, and Ring of Supremacy* depending on the situation.</li>
<li>Use Butcher&#39;s Flail as your melee weapon for the free corrosive proc.</li>
<li>Stick primarily to Iron Sentinel on your Long Gun and Seed Caller on your Hand Gun; but don&#39;t be afraid to mix up summons depending on the situation; but don&#39;t use Rattle Weed with Soul Anchor.</li>
<li>Focus on traits that improve your survivability, mod generation, and summon damage (summons do not scale with mod damage).</li>
<li>Exploit the bugs and quirks of summoning mechanics to leverage every last bit of power out of the build - you will need it in higher difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Will only be relevant as of the next patch.</p>

<h1>10. Summary</h1>

<p>Well, that&#39;s about all I can think of for now. If anyone has any suggestions, or is able to clarify anything I wasn&#39;t certain on, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any feedback and constructive criticism you have to offer. Otherwise, I really hope you enjoyed my guide, and I hope it encourages you to give summoning a go if you haven&#39;t yet. Of all the builds I have tried in Remnant so far, summoning has been by far one of my favourites - so consider bringing a few conjured companions with you as you venture into the Subject 2923 DLC next month!</p>

<p>Im a big fallout 76 , RDR2, and far cry fan but need a break from them. What really sold me was the random generated levels and boss fights,  this takes me back to my Diablo 2 glory days. Any tips for newbies? Also can you pause the game in single player (kids and online games are tough) ? Hopefully get some time today to play!</p>
