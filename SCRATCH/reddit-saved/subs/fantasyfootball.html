<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.smartfantasy.com/tools/smartcheatsheet/">Hereâ€™s the link</a></p>

<p>If you missed last year&#39;s version, here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2dcdx4/ive_spent_the_last_few_weeks_creating_a_web_tool/">reddit thread of the release.</a></p>

<p>Hey guys! Sorry for the delay. Hopefully we got this thing out in time for your drafts! </p>

<p>SmartCheatsheet is a free web tool that takes in your league settings and generates a customized cheatsheet based on those settings. From there, you can reorder players, create custom tabs, choose from over 150 stats/metric columns, sort on anything, and even draft off of the cheatsheet. SmartCheatSheet isn&#39;t a narrow recommendation engine that drafts for you. Nor is it an overly complicated and hard to navigate series of checkboxes and text fields. It&#39;s an accessible, comprehensive collection of tons of stats, presented in a completely customizable, sortable, drag-and-drop interface. <a href="http://www.smartfantasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slideSmartCheatSheet.png">Here</a> are <a href="http://www.smartfantasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/slideLeagueSettings.png">some</a> <a href="http://www.smartfantasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/slideColumns.png">screenshots</a>.</p>

<p>New features for the 2015 version include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag and Drop reordering</li>
<li>Faster drafting, reordering, and general load times</li>
<li>Custom tabs - create unlimited tabs, each with their own columns, filters, and sorts</li>
<li>Hundreds of columns to choose from and ability to order them</li>
<li>On the fly column sorting</li>
<li>Ability to reorder your ranks based on column sort</li>
<li>VORP (Value Over Replacement Level) column based on up-to-date projections</li>
<li>Player Search</li>
</ul>

<p>Features we&#39;re still working on and WILL be available soon</p>

<ul>
<li>Keepers</li>
<li>Resizable columns</li>
<li>Player Notes</li>
<li>Player News</li>
<li>PRV (Position Rank Value)</li>
<li>Steal/Reach metric</li>
<li>Consistency Metric</li>
<li>Ability to Edit/Delete leagues</li>
<li>More Auction value columns</li>
<li>More IDP Support</li>
<li>Player tiers</li>
<li>Print/Export functionality</li>
<li>Mobile version</li>
</ul>

<p>If league creation is taking a while, please bear with us, as there are a lot of calculations to make and probably a lot of people hitting our server. Once it&#39;s loaded, though, the data will be saved in cache and speed should no longer be a problem!</p>

<p>Check it out, give us feedback, and follow us on twitter @SmartFantasyNFL to see when new features get added (which will happen pretty much every day until the season starts.) We will also be sending out product updates through our mailing list, and answering any questions you may have on here! Hope you guys like it!</p>

<p>--EDIT: Forgot to mention: due to time constraints, this tool is optimized for Chrome and Firefox only, and currently not optimized for mobile. It may work on other browsers, but it hasn&#39;t been tested. </p>

<p>--EDIT: Our server is getting hammered right now but we&#39;re trying to keep up with it. We&#39;re monitoring the responsive time on the site. We&#39;ll adjust the size of our server to accommodate. Please hang with us if things are slow (it is launch day today)</p>

<p>--EDIT: Looks like league creation is completely down. We&#39;re working to get it back up and will report back when it is!</p>

<p>--EDIT 8/14 10:10 AM CST: It may take us another day to get league creation up again, we&#39;re going to take it down for now. We apologize for the inconvenience and will email everyone on the mailing list when its ready to go again.</p>

<p>--EDIT: 8/17 11:47PM CST You may have noticed that we&#39;ve got the tool back up and running. It&#39;s still got a few bugs so once we fix those we&#39;ll make another big post with updates. Follow our twitter feed for more up-to-date news.</p>

<p>--EDIT: 8/18- The tool has been officially rereleased. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3hij1m/smartcheatsheet_2015_round_2/">Here&#39;s the new thread</a></p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I play in a league that has no waiver system (which is a terrible, terrible system in my mind) - players are never on waivers. They are literally free agents at all times. During games, immediately after they are dropped, you name it. Anyway, as much as I dislike this system, keeping a close eye on the add/drops in this league can get pretty competitive. Does anyone know of any smartphone apps, or any 3rd party program, that will notify/e-mail me whenever there is an add/drop transaction in a Yahoo league?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a professor of Prescriptive Analytics at the University of Miami and I wrote a two-part blog post on how to use an optimization model to create a fantasy football team that maximizes its point projection, while respecting several different league constraints (budget, team composition, flex player, etc.). I show how to model requirements of different online leagues and provide a sample Excel sheet. If you know of a useful/specific/weird requirement of a fantasy league that isn&#39;t addressed by my model, let me know and I&#39;ll write a follow-up post explaining how to do it. I&#39;m not making money out of this. My motivation for putting this together came from several questions I received from students who take my class.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9hsg2x4qtkr44b/Example%201.xlsx?dl=0">Link to BeerSheets</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this mock draft is to show you the basics of BeerSheets and value based drafting. There are multiple draft strategies out there (0RB, VBD, late round QB, etc) and in general BeerSheets can help with all of them. BeerSheets provide a combination of aggregate values and aggregate rankings, along with historical and ADP information, to give you the information you need to make an informed drafting choice. They&#39;re designed to be printed out and crossed out during the draft so that at every pick you have a snapshot of who is available. BeerSheets are formatted with six columns including name, team/bye, player rank according to FantasyPros in round.pick format, the number of weeks last year that a player was elite, startable, and played, the mean player value, and finally the percentage of positive value left in that position after the player is drafted. The columns are shaded, alternating gray and white, to indicate how players are grouped together into tiers. The rank column is formatted to provide ADP information. When the value is struck through a player is taken at least a round ahead of their rank. When underlined or double underlined they are taken one or two (or more) rounds afterwards.</p>

<p>Value Based Drafting (VBD) is a drafting method that relies on the assumption that a player&#39;s value can be compared across positions by comparing the points a player scores relative to a baseline. The idea is that, beyond a certain level of performance, a player will be replaced and therefore has no value. By comparing the difference in projected points betIen a player and that baseline you can get a sense of how valuable a given RB is relative to a QB. The problem with VBD is that it is only as good as the projections, and historically draft projections have been very poor (on the order of 60% accurate at best). VBD assumes perfect performance and may not necessarily take into account the upside or risk a player has. It also fails to take into account the consequences of missing games (Tom Brady, for example, has a projected value equivalent to Jay Cutler over 16 games). </p>

<p>The primary purpose of this example is to provide a basic guideline for BeerSheets and how they can be used. This is not <strong>the</strong> way to use BeerSheets; in the end they are a tool and it&#39;s up to you to decide how they are best implemented. The most important thing at the end of the draft is that you are personally happy with your team, and often that may mean going with your gut or knowledge not on a sheet of paper. Often you will see examples of where there is no clear choice, and you may decide your team would be better off doing something different. That&#39;s okay! Let me know what you think below.</p>

<p>This is a ten team, half PPR league with 1QB, 2RB, 3WR, 1TE, 1FLX, 1DST, and 1PK. Scoring is otherwise standard. I randomly chose to go with the fifth overall pick, which tends to lend itself well to a VBD strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 1.5:</strong> The WR and RB tiers have the highest values at this stage. Todd Gurley is at the top of his position and is the only player left in his tier. However looking at his value you see that it&#39;s very close to DeAndre Hopkins and AJ Green (6.9 vs 6.8). I see that Gurley is ranked higher (6th overall vs 8th or 9th), but that the WR position has less value left (73% once the tier is exhausted vs 86%). Given the disparity in PS I go with DeAndre Hopkins. </p>

<p><strong>Pick 2.6:</strong> With Gronkowski gone the selection is once against between RB and WR. I see that the remaining RB in his tier is Devonta Freeman, while multiple players are spread over the WR position. Freeman&#39;s value lies within the tier that ranges from Dez Bryant to Mike Evans so I can consider them equal there. I&#39;m left with a difficult decision. Going by player rank within the tier would suggest going with Dez Bryant, who is ranked over half a round ahead of the rest of his tier. PS doesn&#39;t help as they generally overlap. Given that he is the only player remaining in his tier, and the large number of WRs left, I go with Freeman. The hope is that at least one player from the Bryant to Evans tier will be left and make the decision easier. That said going with Bryant would make perfect sense here. Remember the numbers are just a guideline; pick the team and the players you&#39;ll be happy with. </p>

<p><strong>Pick 3.5:</strong> Once again I find ourselves picking between the last RB of a tier and the entire suite of WR. Our gamble from the previous round didn&#39;t work as planned as every player from the Bryant to Evans tier is gone. As before McCoy&#39;s value overlaps him with the tier from Cooks to Watkins, and as before his PS value also doesn&#39;t help. The rankings also overlap, although there&#39;s a chance that Watkins could be there on the turn of the fourth. I&#39;ve also reached the point where QBs and TEs may come into play, but their rankings suggest they&#39;ll be available in the fourth round. I go with LeSean McCoy. Again one could make an argument for picking a WR, but I&#39;m willing to bet (again) that a WR from the tier will be available. Maybe this time I&#39;ll actually be right.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 4.6:</strong> FINALLY. The gamble paid off. Watkins is the last player of his tier with a value higher than any of the RBs. While Watkins value does overlap with Reed and the tier of Newton and Rodgers, their PS values are significantly higher indicating much more depth is available. I go with Watkins. He&#39;s the clear choice as the last player in his tier while having lower PS than equivalently valuable players in other positions. This represents a very important decision point, as I&#39;ve decided to forgo drafting a QB or TE even though the value is comparable. This may force me to stream players or reach later on.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 5.5:</strong> Now things start to separate. The top tier of TEs is gone and the first QB is also off the board. I still need a QB, TE, WR, and flex assuming our strategy is to fill out our starters before going for depth. The available tiers seem to have QB ahead of WR, WR and TE generally overlapping, and RB a tier behind. Fortunately I&#39;ve filled out my starting RBs already so I can continue to target players based on value instead of need. I could go with Rodgers, who wins out on both ranking and projected value, but with plenty of other QBs left I may want to wait. Any argument I&#39;d make for Olsen would likely apply better to Rodgers so the TE position can wait. With RB&#39;s value being so low the final option is WR or QB. I go with Maclin. His ranking is only three spots behind Rodgers and more importantly the positional scarcity of the WR position is extremely low. </p>

<p><strong>Pick 6.6:</strong> There was a chance that Wilson would make it back to us as the underline underneath his ranking of 5.8 indicated his ADP was more than a round behind his rank. Unfortunately that didn&#39;t happen and I&#39;m seeing positional scarcity start to fall everywhere. QB has two players that share a tier but have a round between their ranks (and in the case of Brees I see that like Wilson his ADP is a round after that). TE also has two players but their rankings suggest they&#39;ll be around in the 7th or even the 8th round. RB and WR both have a single player left in their tier and similar PS values. Do I take a QB or fill out our flex? I go with Jones. While getting Luck would be a pretty awesome luxury the projections suggest that Brees will provide similar value and be available next round. Matthews is tempting (and is arguably the better choice from a raw value perspective) but looking at the rankings of the players in the next tier it looks like there will be more WRs available than RBs. </p>

<p><strong>Pick 7.5:</strong> Looks like I made the right choice, several more RBs were taken but surprisingly not a single WR. Several players go ahead of their expected draft position, most notably Brees and Fleener. I&#39;m left with the bottom half of both the QBs and TEs all sharing the same tier, which means I can wait. Once again I&#39;re deciding between RB and WR. I go with Matthews, as value alone makes this an easy choice.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: 8.6:</strong> A run of WRs, RBs, and TEs leaves us in a rather precarious situation with only two QBs and three TEs left in the &quot;starter&quot; tiers. However picking up those players would necessitate making a sacrifice on value as both the RB and WR groups still have significant value left. Looking at the draft board it seems like I&#39;m the only team without a TE, and only one other team lacks a QB. With that in mind I can likely afford to wait another round or two (or just punt entirely and embrace streaming, which is very viable in a 10 team league). I go with Hill. Of the remaining players in the WR and RB columns he has the lowest rank and it looks like at least one team is almost certain to grab a RB. There are some arguments against taking players on the same team who are bunched together (since Bernard is right next to him), and in that context I could easily see Gore also being a good option. </p>

<p><strong>Pick 9.5:</strong> Sure enough there was a huge run on RBs but surprisingly I also saw two TEs taken. That leaves me with the QB10 (Rivers) and TE10 (Witten) remaining. Looking over their ADP it seems likely that Rivers will be taken soon, but Witten&#39;s projection has him going in the 14th. That said there is still a ton of value in the WR spot (and given their ranks it&#39;s not likely that any of them will be there for long). I go with Parker. Although John Brown is ranked one spot lower, Parker&#39;s mean value projection is higher and he doesn&#39;t share a bye week with any other WR. Normally ignoring bye weeks is a good idea but I like to use it as a tie breaker.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 10.6:</strong> As expected a run on WRs and RBs took out a lot of players. The TE and QB situation remain as they were before with one player remaining in a tier above the rest. I go with DeSean Jackson. This runs the risk of someone getting a QB2 before I get my QB1, but this will provide me with a significant amount of depth and allow me to focus on streamers and other players as our skill positions are now largely locked up.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 11.5:</strong> With another run on RBs and WRs it&#39;s time I picked a QB. I&#39;ve waited long enough and get Philip Rivers a full round after his rank says he should go.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 12.6:</strong> Now I&#39;m starting to hit the bottom of the barrel. Unfortunately Julius Thomas was picked up which is a shame because his ranking is in the tenth and that would have been a nice steal. With six WRs and 4 RBs I&#39;m looking pretty good for starters and depth and only my TE spot remains unfilled. At this point I can reach a bit and grab Eric Ebron, hoping that Witten will be available on the turn back.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 13.5:</strong> Unfortunately this round reveals one of the flaws of this draft sheet; the devaluation of suspended players like Tom Brady. Having Brady would have been an excellent complement to Rivers, but because he is so low on my sheet I overlooked him. Otherwise the round was an expected array of RBs and WRs with Bennett also going off the board. At this point I can stick with the plan and pick up Witten. It should be noted that FantasyPros considered both Ebron and Witten to be a slight reach, and in retrospect had I picked up Reed in the fourth I could have instead gotten more depth for those positions.</p>

<p><strong>Pick 14.6:</strong> At this point I&#39;m focusing on lottery picks, PKs, and DSTs. Looking at our sheet I see a massive number of QBs who will likely be there on the waiver wire and therefore I probably can afford to not draft a QB2. Given that Kenneth Dixon is the best ranked player between the RBs and WRs remaining he&#39;s a reasonable pickup.</p>

<p><strong>Picks 15.5 and 16.6:</strong> I pick up Gostkowski in the 15th as he&#39;s been consistently the highest scoring kicker in the last few years. Arguably he&#39;s consistent enough to warrant an even earlier pick, and this is another example of where waiting on QB and TE has forced my hand. Finally I end our draft with the Cincinnati Bengals. While the New England Patriots are technically ranked higher, their first four games don&#39;t feature Tom Brady and frankly I&#39;ll be streaming them anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> In the end FantasyPros gave me a C+, saying the team was at the very bottom for starter quality and very top for depth. My QB and TEs aren&#39;t anything to cheer about but should prove passable. I have strong starters for RB and some depth that can also serve as a flex. WR provides us with solid starters and plenty of depth, with a nice combination of high floor players and high ceiling picks. In retrospect I would have likely gone a bit heavier on WR and then drafted more RB depth, possibly even going 0RB. Drafting Luck in the 6th would also have been a luxury that would have allowed me to focus on depth and not worry about my QB situation. Regardless these are minor quibbles. </p>

<p>I hope this guide proved helpful and gives you a sense of how BeerSheets can be used in a draft. Let me know what you think!</p>

<h2>Better D/ST scoring: It's What We Deserve</h2>

<div id="5jspua" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do these numbers mean anything to you? 0, 6, 13, 17, 27, 34, 45, 100, 199, 299, 399, 499, 549</p>

<p>They&#39;re the standard D/ST scoring tiers on ESPN (and maybe other sites) for Points Allowed and Yards Allowed. At each tier the D/ST loses a chunk of fantasy points (usually spread from +5 to -5), resulting in a +10 boost to your team score at kickoff, only to teeter and (usually) trend towards negative over the course of a 3-hour game. It&#39;s really annoying to watch your projection shoot up, then taper off, and if the opposing team returns an INT for a TD... that counts against your D/ST as well because default scoring settings (again... on ESPN, at least) don&#39;t differentiate between a Pick 6 and passing TD.</p>

<p>Having been dissatisfied with ESPN&#39;s default scoring for D/ST for several years now, I set out to find a better scoring format that more closely mirrors how scores happen for positional players. I implemented most of the scoring settings below in a dynasty league I started this year on Fleaflicker, and so far the response has been positive, though there is a learning curve to offset years of being brainwashed by chunked tiers that can go really negative really fast.</p>

<p>I want to share my settings with you, for you to implement at your own discretion, because I hate the default D/ST settings so much. So while this scoring format isn&#39;t regarded as perfect, it is totally preferential and, in many obvious ways, better than most default settings. I&#39;d like to use IDP one day, but my league(s) have been resistant to the idea.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ol>
<li>Treat D/ST like a player, starting with zero points at kickoff and trending positive throughout a game. </li>
<li>Negative point totals should only occur rarely (like when Dez caught a single 10yd pass a couple weeks ago, and fumbled it). </li>
<li>Top D/ST squads should not outperform top positional players on average (bc we don&#39;t want to draft D/ST in high rounds).</li>
<li>There should be clear value for any elite D/ST compared to good, middle, and bad defenses just like we have tiers of players at other positions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here we go... we&#39;ll start with the easy stuff. There&#39;s a <strong>TLDR</strong> at the bottom.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Easy Stuff</h2>

<p><strong>Defensive TDs of any kind are worth 6 points.</strong> Just like a TD for a skill player, you gotta credit the D when they directly put points on the scoreboard. Counts for INT and FR.</p>

<p><strong>Punt/Kick return TDs are worth 8 points</strong>. I like to give a boost for return TDs because they are momentum shifters and won&#39;t receive a <em>natural</em> bonus from turnover points. And, some leagues already give value to return yards but I find that&#39;s hard to balance since nearly every return nets 5-25 yards and there are many returns every game. Running a kickoff to the 20 yard line isn&#39;t an accomplishment, but adding a 2pt bonus to a return TD compensates for the yards they must&#39;ve covered to take it to the house. /rant</p>

<p><strong>Turnovers are worth 2 points.</strong> Whether it&#39;s an Interception or a Fumble Recovery, it&#39;s worth 2 points. I like to split Forced Fumble and Fumble Recovery (1 point each) but you do you.</p>

<p><strong>Safeties are worth 4 points.</strong> Not only is it 2 points on the scoreboard, but it&#39;s also a turnover. So it&#39;s 4 points total because math.</p>

<p><strong>2-PT Conversion Returns are worth 4 points.</strong> They put 2 points on the board for the team and prevent 2 points from the opposing team: a 4-point swing in theory. They can shift the momentum of a game just a much as a Safety, if not more so (just ask the Falcons from Week 13).</p>

<p><em>Using only these settings</em>, we&#39;re looking at a top-tier D/ST putting up 105-125 points over the course of a season. The top five D/ST for 2015 (again... using just these settings) would&#39;ve been </p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Four of these teams look familiar as high performers last year, so we must be on the right track. <em>If you&#39;re a nerd and wondering who the bottom D/ST squads are with these settings, it is the 32. Bears and 31. 49ers with barely 30 points each.</em></p>

<p>We still need to boost these scores and get them to be more comparable to skill positions, whose elite talent is scoring 250-300 per season, but we&#39;ll come back to that, as we have yet to address sacks, blocked kicks, etc. Spoiler: our target for top D/ST is 200 points but again - it&#39;s your preference how powerful you want them to be.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Negative Mechanisms</h2>

<p>First (or second... but who&#39;s counting) let&#39;s get our negative mechanisms in place for really bad defensive play. Reviewing the <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-yards-per-game">average yards allowed per team</a> in 2016 and 2015, we see an <em>average</em> yards allowed per game is 350 and 353, respectively. So if that&#39;s an <em>average</em> day for a defensive unit, let&#39;s not trend negative until we&#39;re beyond that.</p>

<p>So <strong>let&#39;s trend negative after 400 Yards Allowed</strong> and do the same calculation for Points Allowed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/offensive-points-per-game">a table of offensive points per team</a> and <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/special-teams-points-per-game">another table for special teams points per team</a>. Teams averaged 21.9 and 21.6 total Offensive+Special Teams Points in 2016 and 2015, respectively, so <strong>let&#39;s trend negative after 25 Offensive+Special Teams Points Allowed</strong> for our D/ST scoring. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vg-kbtl3PvYYOMss_VD8Eg0KadoAUt5NxO7EkUFz258/edit?usp=sharing">I put all these averages into Google Sheets</a>.</p>

<p>Now... how quickly should we trend negative upon reaching our thresholds? I arbitrarily picked <strong>-2 points per 100 yards allowed beyond 400 (-0.02 per yard) and -2 points per 10 points allowed beyond 25 (-0.2 per point)</strong>. We&#39;ll see how that plays out later, and we can adjust if necessary.</p>

<p>With our negative points plugged in, our top 5 D/ST squads in 2015 are the same, but reordered: </p>

<tr>
<td align="center">5</td>
<td align="left">Eagles</td>
<td align="right">87</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The Eagles moving down on the list indicates they had some games where their defense gave up a lot of points/yards. The Broncos stout D moved up because they were always stingy. These top squads would&#39;ve scored 84-119 fantasy points in 2015 using only these settings. <em>Our bottom feeders would be 32. 49ers and 31. Bears, scoring 15 and 18 points, respectively. Ouch.</em></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s move into the more volatile settings: Sacks, Blocks, etc. These will boost our overall points by quite a bit.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Volatile Settings</h2>

<p><strong>Sacks are worth 1 point.</strong> We can&#39;t make them worth 2 points (bc they&#39;re not equivalent of a turnover) and 1.5 feels too close to equal, so 1 <em>feels like</em> the sweet spot to me. As a rule, just say they&#39;re worth half a turnover (in case we change our turnover points later).</p>

<p><strong>Blocked Kicks are worth 3 points.</strong> Not only are they in many ways like a turnover (worth 2 points) but they&#39;re also a momentum shifter, which should hold value. &quot;Kicks&quot; applies to punts and field goals.</p>

<p>Now our top 4 D/ST units are scoring 140-160 points, a big change in the direction we wanted. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re getting closer, and maybe you&#39;re done. This might be all you want with some minor tweaks, but for me, there are a couple more items I like to add. These are more controversial, and some are not customizable on ESPN. But they&#39;re all available on Fleaflicker. Choose your flavor.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Controversial/Unconventional Settings</h2>

<p><strong>Tackles For Loss are worth .5 point.</strong> Often overlooked, I regard a TFL the same as a sack but occurring on rush attempts and screen passes. They don&#39;t usually result in the same negative yards and aren&#39;t as highly praised as sacks, so at half the value of a sack, TFL boosts our overall D/ST scores by 30-40 points, taking our #1 D/ST right up to that 200 mark. That&#39;s great! Stop here if you are happy. But I want to keep going.</p>

<p><strong>Passes Defended are worth .25 point.</strong> Also overlooked, but more reliably recorded in box scores than <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/09/18/nfl-tackling-history-stat-leaders-lavonte-david">Tackles</a>, are passes defended. It&#39;s common (critical, even) in IDP formats, but is forgotten/almost never used for D/ST.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth-Down Stops are worth 1 point.</strong> While not <em>actually</em> a turnover, a stop on 4th Down is definitely a WIN for the defense, and deserves some value.</p>

<p><strong>Three and Out Drives are worth .5 point.</strong> Every change of possession presents an opportunity for a defense to make a stop, and that is another WIN moment that deserves some value. These occur more frequently than 4th Down Stops, and are arguably not as significant, so I only assign it half a point.</p>

<p>So now all of our top D/ST from 2015 are putting up over 200 points, and I want to adjust them down. So I&#39;m going to revisit our negative points and increase the impact there.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Adjust To Your Preference</h2>

<p>We saw that on an average week, an NFL offense scores 21.x points and accumulates 350 yards. So we set our negative trend to start above those metrics (25 points and 400 yards), but now maybe we realize even an <em>average</em> RB is going to have a fumble once in awhile, so let&#39;s move that needle for D/ST so our average units take more of a hit. <strong>Let&#39;s shift our negative trend to 300 yards allowed and 20 points allowed.</strong> Now the Broncos, whose defense had an incredible year (won the Super Bowl, in case you forgot), is sitting pretty with 248 points.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Wanna shift even further? Let&#39;s try reducing our threshold for points down to 14. Now the Broncos would&#39;ve scored 239 last year, and the Steelers (#5 D/ST) weigh in at 189. The bottom 2 squads are the 49ers and Saints, with 78 and 90 points, respectively. </p>

<td align="right">189</td>

</tbody></table>

<p>Still seems high? Keep adjusting until you find the balance you want. Perhaps leave out the controversial bonuses or any settings your fantasy site doesn&#39;t support. I&#39;m going to increase the rate of negative trending from points allowed. I&#39;m gonna make it <strong>-2 per 8 points allowed beyond 10</strong>.</p>

<p>Especially if you detest counting Yards Allowed against a D/ST (because of trash time, &quot;bend don&#39;t break&quot; coaching philosophies, etc.), increasing the impact of Points Allowed is critical to finding a suitable balance. This final adjustment looks pretty good to me considering the 2015 Broncos performed uncommonly well, so this is where I&#39;m stopping.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>What we&#39;ve ended up with is a reasonably strong group of D/ST units with similar variance among top 5/top 10 as other positions have. And, when kickoff happens you won&#39;t see an inflated projection because of an immediate 10-point bonus to your D/ST. Cheer for defensive playmakers the same you would offensive playmakers, because your D/ST performance is grounded in defensive success, not failure.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>TLDR</h2>

<p><strong>TL;DR Enable D/ST to score points like other positions: starting at zero and trending positive throughout a game, instead of starting with 10 and teetering. Scoring settings are as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>+8 points per Kick/Punt Return TD</li>
<li>+6 points per Defensive TD</li>
<li>+4 points per Safety and Conversion Return</li>
<li>+3 points per Blocked Kick (FGs and Punts)</li>
<li>+2 points per Turnover (INTs and FRs)</li>
<li>+1 point per Sack</li>
<li>-2 points per 100 Yards Allowed beyond 300 (adjust to buff/nerf scores overall)</li>
<li>-2 points per 10 Offensive/Special Teams Points Allowed beyond 14 (adjust to buff/nerf scores overall)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unconventional settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>+1 point per 4th Down Stop</li>
<li>+.5 point per Tackle For Loss</li>
<li>+.5 point per Three and Out Drive</li>
<li>+.25 point per Pass Defended</li>
</ul>

<p>Total D/ST result is best scoring 220-240, worst scoring 75-85 per season.

<p>Don&#39;t use if your league considers it cheating.</p>

<h2>FFL Exploratory Data Analysis (Kaggle) and Tableau Dashboard</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(299)">View full post</button><div id="299" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As part of teaching myself Python, I wanted to do my own digging into what easily attainable metrics correlate most closely with fantasy production. I see articles all the time that mention certain metrics that are most predictive of future performance, but I rarely see actual correlation calculations.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in the answers to any of the questions below, consider taking a look at my analysis on kaggle ( <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/davidwismer/fantasy-football-exp-data-analysis-2015-2019">https://www.kaggle.com/davidwismer/fantasy-football-exp-data-analysis-2015-2019</a> ).</p>

<p>This analysis aims to explore the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which metrics are most correlated with a player&#39;s performance in the upcoming year? </li>
<li>Which metrics correlate most with a player&#39;s performance in the upcoming game? What time period is most appropriate when looking at a player&#39;s past games (prior game, 3 games, 5 games)? </li>
<li>How do key metrics change depend on the player&#39;s position? What about if different scoring systems are used (PPR vs. Regular, for example)? </li>
<li>How closely do individual game attributes like over/under, implied team points, weather, or playing surface impact fantasy production? </li>
<li>Do any available offensive line metrics correlate with fantasy production for different positions? </li>
<li>How can we evaluate rookies?</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s by now means an exhaustive analysis, but maybe you can glean something from it. I also prepared the data to be loaded into a Tableau public file. You can find a set of Tableau dashboards here ( <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.wismer#!/vizhome/FantasyDraftKit/RankingsDash">https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.wismer#!/vizhome/FantasyDraftKit/RankingsDash</a> ). You can create your own visualizations that look like the screenshots included below.</p>
