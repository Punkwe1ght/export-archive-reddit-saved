<li>Grind up 1 oz of dried mushies &amp; put into wide mouth mason jar.</li>
<li>Measure out 300ml everclear and pour over the grinded mushies in the mason jar. (anything 100 proof or above is good)</li>
<li>Use a fork to mix the substance whenever you remember (I did it about twice a day) , and close lid <em>tightly</em>.</li>
<li>Let sit for 24+ hours (the longer the better imo).</li>
<li>Use coffee filter to filter out the liquid into 2nd mason jar. (Make sure to squeeze the extra water out but be careful bc if the filter breaks you‚Äôll have to re-filter.</li>
<li>Place filtered extraction on a medium sized plate and place that plate in a room where there no bs flying around in the air. (I used my mycoroom). </li>
<li>Allow liquid to evaporate to either 25ml (supposedly 1g per ml, sim tested this extract and it the most wonderful clean anxiousness non-nauseous experience you could have off 1g.) </li>
</ol>

<p>To get the goo, you just extract until there is no liquid left. </p>

<p><em>yes you can use a fan on LOW to speed up the extraction process but my extraction took about 2-3 hours to get down to 30ml with the fan. And this one took 2 days without the fan.</em></p>

<p>ENJOY ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• The extractions are highly recommended speaking from experience, yes it takes time but the result is much cleaner in the best ways.</p>

<h2>Seven months after I started this journey, my first flushes</h2>

<p>‚ÄìWorking with agar is the only way to go. My first attempt was with an inoculation to a grain jar. I got all the way through to spawning to bulk with no noticeable issues then lost by tote to trich in less than a week. Agar is indispensable in terms of helping you isolate clean healthy strains. Buy a 500 pack of petri dishes on Amazon (you&#39;ll need a lot), then read and follow BOD&#39;s agar TEK: <a href="https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/21922023">https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/21922023</a></p>

<p>‚ÄìSterile technique is obviously critical, and there are little unexpected things that can mess it up. For example, for a while almost all my plates were getting contaminated. I couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on because I was being so careful, until after describing my technique in extreme detail to another user they pointed out that I was sterilizing my blade inside the SAB. The flame creates air currents, which was spreading contam. I started sterilizing my blades and inoculation loops outside the SAB and my contam rate dropped dramatically.</p>
