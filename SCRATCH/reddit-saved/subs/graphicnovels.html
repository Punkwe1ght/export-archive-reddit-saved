<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read through most of From Hell.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t sure if there were really any sort of traditional mysteries that weren&#39;t with ghosts or zombies....</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I bought -- Ex Machina, The Fade Out, Queen and Country, and Hawaiin Dick at my local comic shop.</p>

<p>I looked at all of your suggestions and also talked to the guy who works there and hopefully found some cool stuff.</p>

<p>My wife is an illustrator and maybe I need to just write the kind of comics I want to read ;-) </p>

<p>THANKS EVERYONE!!</p>

<h2>Graphic Novel of the Week Discussion Thread: "Underwater Welder" by Jeff Lemire</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Jeff Lemire. That name holds a lot of weight in the comic industry these days, and for good reason. With books such as this one, Essex County, Descender, Sweet Tooth, Animal Man, Trillium, and the upcoming AD: After Death and Roughneck being in his repertoire it&#39;s no wonder Lemire is a heavy weight. His art is uniquely crude and brilliantly detailed at the same time, and his stories are often a keen exploration of the human condition in the most blue-collar of ways. </p>

<p>This book, The Underwater Welder, Lemire&#39;s solo effort after writing and illustrating Sweet Tooth for Vertigo and being hired to write the newly released (back in 2012) Animal Man for DC&#39;s New 52, is the perfect example of what he has to offer. While there are a few flaws with this book, it still is held in highest regards in the Graphic Novel and Comic book community. </p>

<p>The story is about a man named Jack Joseph, an underwater welder on an oil rig, and his struggle with his young wife and becoming a new father while dealing with his own father&#39;s death. The obvious imagery is that being essentially locked in his current position (where&#39;s he going to go? he&#39;s on an oil rig for Odin&#39;s sake) he is forced to confront his fears and his past. Despite the obvious, Lemire delivers it with his characteristic style, black and white panels with many panels being without dialogue at all. Although this book is vastly different from his previous work Sweet Tooth, in the way that it doesn&#39;t experiment as much and it doesn&#39;t take as many artistic risks, the concept behind it and his vision takes it up and beyond. </p>

<p>My favorite quote from the comments section of goodreads.com is this: &quot;Memory is a beast, savage and merciless&quot;. I feel like that perfectly embodies the driving force in this book, his memories and past are hindering him from stepping into the future, a future that is bright and filled with love. Jeff Lemire has always been good at delivering those messages. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Possible Discussion Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Where does this book sit in terms of Lemire&#39;s bibliography for you? </p></li>
<li><p>Does the art help advance the message behind this book or is it a secondary though when reading through it?</p></li>
<li><p>Like I said, Lemire is a heavyweight in the industry, but he isn&#39;t without his flaws, like many. What, if any, might be considered a flaw in this style of primarily raw writing that Lemire is so keen on? Does he step on his own feet sometimes?</p></li>
<li><p>What was your introduction to Jeff&#39;s work? First impressions?</p></li>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: I&#39;ve since added additional lists, many of which are from <a href="/u/ugly_duck">/u/ugly_duck</a>, which have changed the totals some. </p>

<p>Over the last few months there have been many, many websites with “Best of 2016” lists concerning comic books and graphic novels. If you’ve looked at a few, you may have noticed some of the same books on different lists and seen some unique to only that list.</p>

<p>I went through over 100 different “Best Of” Lists regarding comic books and graphic novels and combined them into a spreadsheet. There are 1,918 different listings of books from these websites. I should note that I’ve included books that were given honorable mentions. In short, if somebody thought it was a good book that you should check out, it’s on here.     </p>

<p><a href="http://jamiecoville.com/blog/blog/2017/01/29/the-combined-best-graphic-novels-of-2016/">The list is here, with some summary results. You can also download the excel spreadsheet if you&#39;d like.</a></p>
