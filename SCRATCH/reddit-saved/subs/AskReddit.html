<h2>What "I know it sounds weird, but just try it" thing do you swear by?</h2>

<div class="md"><p>I had a job doing this for awhile. </p>

<p>I was a &quot;guest experience captain&quot; at buffalo wild wings. The most fun thing was convincing people to try strange combinations of sauces.</p>

<p>So many damn people came in, tried honey BBQ, liked it and never tried another damn thing. That mentality was maddening to me, in sauces and in life. </p>

<p>So I told them hold on here. I would come out with every sauce we had and a bunch of free fries. &quot;We are going to find you a new sauce today.&quot; Then one by one I would go through the sauces with them until they were too spicy. But EVERY SINGLE TIME we would find a sauce that they even liked more!</p>

<p>Then for people that had actually tried a lot of sauces I would break out my &quot;I know it sounds weird, but just try it&quot; which would be mixing sauces. Spicy garlic and lemon pepper? Just try it, it is awesome. Mixing Thai Curry and Parmesan Garlic, sounds weird just try it. Mixing the Teriyaki and the southwest ranch? Hell yeah.</p>

<p>Basically just try new things in life, otherwise you won&#39;t know if you are truly living life to it&#39;s full potential. Even with sauces. </p>

<p>EDIT: I am getting more messages than I can keep up with. </p>

<p>So, yes you can mix two sauces together and have them tossed in the back and brought out to you.</p>

<p>Also for the sauce recommendations:</p>

<p>One thing I did quite often on birthdays. I would get every single sauce and seasoning out on the table and mix them together. ( you have to do it right or it tastes like ass.) But I would mix them together and have everyone at the birthday table try it. It often tastes actually pretty awesome. A lot of people ask to keep the sauce mixture and dip their wings in it.</p>

<p>Teriyaki and Asian Zing together. </p>

<p>Mango Habanero and Asian Zing</p>

<p>Spicy Garlic and Parm Garlic</p>

<p>Desert Heat and then dip in caramel</p>

<p>Lemon Pepper and Wild</p>

<p>Buffalo ( the seasoning) and Parm Gar</p>

<p>Chipotle BBq and Caribbean Jerk</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I got linked to <a href="/r/BestOf">r/BestOf</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7zhhsy/former_buffalo_wild_wings_employee_explains_the/">Here</a> Which I am embarassed to say has completely made my day.</p>

<p>Also, Need some love for <a href="/u/Poem_for_your_sprog">u/Poem_for_your_sprog</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7zepcu/what_i_know_it_sounds_weird_but_just_try_it_thing/dunszmq/">Here</a></p>

<p>EDIT 3: More sauces before I leave for an event tonight</p>

<p>Sweet BBQ Mixed With Chipotle BBQ</p>

<p>They Did it for Awhile - Honey BBQ with caramel and salt</p>

<p>Asian Zing and Parmesan Garlic - Weird but worth the try</p>

<p>I also did a whole presentation for doing taste tests paired with beer. Maybe i&#39;ll add that later. </p>

<p>Also, I have gotten a few PMs about bringing back Jammin&#39; Jalapeno. I do not work there anymore. But I can pass on the message the next time I go get some wings. </p>

<div class="md"><p>A reverse kegel is essentially the relaxation of the pelvic floor. Instead of flexing a muscle to stop ejaculation, a reverse kegel releases that built up tension before climax, without releasing your load. Once you get the hang of it the reverse kegel almost feels like a superpower. I&#39;ve gone 15+ minutes of PIV at a time consistently by keeping relaxed and using the reverse kegel. Make sure you&#39;re practicing the regular kegel before you try the reverse though, otherwise you&#39;ll find it difficult to locate the right muscles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.risingmaster.com/reverse-kegels/">Here&#39;s</a> a guide I used to get me started. Give yourself a couple of weeks before you expect results. I promise it&#39;s worth it.</p>

I wish every American knew about the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), their propaganda side-kick State Policy Network (SPN) — and the tremendous damage they have inflicted on our democracy. 
No one who has watched them in action over past 20+ years could be too surprised about Trump presidency.
If anyone is interested in learning about ALEC basics, Bill Moyers report is good who/how/why overview.
