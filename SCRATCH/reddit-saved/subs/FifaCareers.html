There&#39;s only 3 new skills moves this year, and they are all in the 5-star tier.  </p>

<p><strong>Skill Moves</strong><br/>

<div class="md"><p>Here is a list of players I always look at signing. Most of these guys are teenagers with high potential and with decent pace and skill moves/weak foot.</p>

<p>GK - Alex Remiro, he is 21 so a bit older. I mainly use him because he is 6&#39;3&quot; and has GK long throw trait.</p>

<p>LB - Rico Henry, very high pace and young with decent potential.</p>

<p>CB - Jeremiah St Juste, he has really good pace and is 6&#39;1&quot;.</p>

<p>CB - Axel Tuanzebe, also 6&#39;1&quot;, with decent pace.</p>

<p>RB - Erick Aguirre, young with good pace.</p>

<p>CDM - Timothy Fosu-Mensah, tall, strong and with decent pace for a CDM. He can also play CB and is 6&#39;4&quot;.</p>

<p>CM - Pablo Galdames, 4 star skills, decent pace and good defending stats for a CM.</p>

<p>CM - Lewis Cook - similar to Pablo above but with 4 star weak foot and 3 star skills.</p>

<p>RM - Emre Mor, 4 star skills high pace and high balance &amp; agility. He is so much fun to dribble with. Feels like Messi.</p>

<p>LM - Rafik Zekhnini, excellent pace with 4 start skills &amp; weak foot. He plays a lot like a young Ronaldo.</p>

<p>CF - Moses Simon, excellent pace, agility and balance with 4 star skill and 5 star weak foot.</p>

<p>You may already know about some of these.</p>

<h2>Bait and Switch Transfers</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have realized after a few months that you can avoid other teams coming in for a player you want by pulling a bait and switch. You identify who you want, and then identify a player roughly the same age, in the same position, and of the same rough overall. You enquire, and then put in a lowball bid on the second player, the one you don&#39;t want, and then wait until they return with a no, and make a reasonable bid, then around this point I often see the other teams come in like pira√±as, so I then go and put in a reasonable bid on the guy I want, and watch the others fight over the guy I didn&#39;t want while I easily sign the one I want. I have yet to lose a guy I actually want to get using this method. </p>

<h2>Guide to Regens</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/wuglin </span>
<span class = "numcomments">37 comments </span>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/595uro/guide_to_regens/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('595uro')">View full post</button>
<div id="595uro" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted a shorter version of this as a reply in another thread previously, but I keep seeing questions about regens coming up so I thought I&#39;d make this its own post for better visibility. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my list of the best regens (85+ potential) that usually happen in seasons 2-4, along with what to search for in position(s), nationality, league, and status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zlatan: ST, Sweden, Premier League, &quot;Has potential to be special&quot;</li>
<li>Lahm: RB/CDM/CM, Germany, Bundesliga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Pepe: CB, Portugal, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Cech: GK, Czech Republic, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Buffon: GK, Italy, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Iniesta: CM, Spain, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Robben: RM/RW, Netherlands, Bundesliga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Ribery: LM/LW, France, Bundesliga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Barzagli: CB, Italy, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Bravo: GK, Chile, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Dani Alves: RB, Brazil, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Mascherano: CB/CDM, Argentina, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>And seasons 5-6:</p>

<ul>
<li>CR7: LW/LM/ST, Portugal, La Liga, &quot;Has potential to be special&quot;</li>
<li>Modric: CM/CDM, Croatia, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Thiago Silva: CB, Brazil, Ligue 1, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Sergio Ramos: CB, Spain, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Godin: CB, Uruguay, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Chiellini: CB, Italy, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>David Silva: CAM/LM, Spain, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Handanovic: GK, Slovenia, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Marchisio: CM/CDM, Italy, Serie A, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Miranda: CB, Brazil, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Cazorla: CAM/CM/CDM, Spain, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Kompany: CB, Belgium, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Koscielny: CB, France, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Filipe Luis: LB, Brazil, La Liga, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
<li>Mandanda: GK, France, Premier League, &quot;An exciting prospect&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>And lastly, a few general notes on searching for regens: </p>

<ul>
<li>Regens will always have the exact same nationality and position(s). </li>
<li>Players don&#39;t always retire at the same age - in your save, it might be a bit earlier or later than on my list. </li>
<li>If a player has been transferred to a different league before his retirement, search within that league rather than the league listed above. </li>
<li>If you can&#39;t find the regen in the proper league, search in free agents. I typically search free agents (ages 21 and below) at the beginning of each season anyways - look for players with lots of green in their technical skills. These are usually players with at least &quot;Showing great potential.&quot; </li>
<li>You won&#39;t be able to see the regen&#39;s status if they are &quot;Loan Listed&quot;. </li>
<li>I believe 21 years old is the max starting age for a regen. </li>
<li>Work rates/weak foot/skill moves/height are all randomized - so good luck! </li>
<li>To automatically find lots of high potential regens, set two of your Global Transfer Network searches to &quot;Pacey + Promising&quot; and &quot;Strong + Promising&quot;, respectively. You&#39;ll find plenty of regens with at least &quot;Showing great potential&quot; after the first few seasons. </li>
</ul>

<div id="d98j9so" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>It is a little misleading even if you scout for any type of player.</p>

<p>Lets say we want to find a winger and scout for any type for some reason. We follow this picture so we go to Japan where the chance of wingers is 40%. However, we want a good winger, and the chance of platinum players in Japan is only 3%, meaning that just 1.2% (=0.03*0.40) of the players we scout is a platinum winger.</p>

<p>Compare this to Brazil where the chance of wingers is 30% and the chance of platinum is 15% mean the chance of platinum wingers is 4.5% (=0.30*0.15), more than 3 times higher than the chance in Japan!</p>

<p>I think a more accurate way would be to do this multiplication for all countries and types, which results in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5H6GsIk.png">this table</a> (thanks to excel), which is very different from your recommendations in OP.</p>

<p>Do note that I have written chance which is not very accurate as then we would be finding 100% GK&#39;s in each country, but they are certainly more indicative of the relative chances of a great player of each type per region than OP. I realize now that I am a bit negative towards your post but please don&#39;t see that as a personal thing, I am only trying to get the most accurate information out. btw if you want the excel file to use for your website or anything just say so and I&#39;ll upload it somewhere.</p>

<p>Of course this still ignores the effect of what you tell your scout to look for which is almost certainly very important as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Near the end of the year (late May early June since season restarts after June), put 95% of your money into your wage budget and offer players you don&#39;t mind getting rid of new contracts all huge contracts (for Pounds max is 890,000 and Dollars is 1,000,000). Make sure you have some money left in your transfer budget as you have to pay the signing on fee for your player, if it&#39;s zero all contracts get declined. Do that to as many players as you can. In the next season, you will start with whatever amount of money the board allocates to you (money doesn&#39;t actually carry over from season to season, they say it does but it doesn&#39;t). So next season the board allocates you however much (in my second season as Arsenal I believe it was around 80 million transfer, 2 million wage or around there). You find a player you want to buy, or just a random player and go to buy them, but when you do include the player you gave the massive contract to as well. For example in my Arsenal career I would give Debuchy a contract of 890,000 in June, when the new season turns over I would go to buy some random, for instance buying Reece Oxford from West Ham. I would offer them 2 million plus Debuchy. When they accept you gain back all that wage from last season. Doing this with multiple players easily gives you hundreds of millions. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been playing career mode with both Dortmund and Liverpool, and although I&#39;ve been doing well and love them both, I wanted to move on to something a bit more challenging, albeit with a bigger sense of achievement at the end.</p>

<p>I chose FC St. Pauli (2. Bundesliga), mainly because they&#39;ve got nice kits, a decent squad and I&#39;ve got a massive soft spot for them cause of their club culture. I&#39;m going to use the +60% starting budget for a little boost, but for the sake of a little realism I&#39;ve decided to refrain from using the Financial Takeover, as I feel that would kind of undermine the club values.</p>

<p>As this is one of my first times doing an RTG, I&#39;m not too familiar with the lower-league must-buys, and I&#39;m seeing if you could help a bit. In career modes I like to play a gegenpressing, attack/counter-attack-oriented style, with formations often rotating; but usually being a 4-2-3-1, 4-3-2-1, 4-4-1-1 or 4-1-2-1-2. With this in mind, what young, high-potential players would you recommend?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I like to buy young (&lt;25) players in preparation for the future, so most careers I tend to raid Dortmund&#39;s youth prospects (Take Mor out on load and buy him later, buy Pulisic and Passlack), and if I have a decent amount of money Emre Can is an absolute gun in the defensive half. </p>

<p>Timo Werner (Lawnball Leipzig, ST) is a common signing for me, as well as Timon Wellenreuther (Schalke, GK). Leonardo Bittencourt (Koln, LM) is a great signing for a mid-table team, as well as Kasper Dolberg (Ajax, ST). For lower-table clubs, Conor Chaplin (Portsmouth, ST) is a must, and if you happen to be playing on 16 (don&#39;t know how he is on 17) Marcel Hartel (Koln, CAM) grows an absolute INSANE amount, by the third season he&#39;d gone from a 59OVR reserve to 81OVR and playing for the national team.</p>

<li>Playing Home or Away (You are much more likely to win home matches than away matches) </li>
<li>(And the hidden factor, counter formations. Where you counter the opponents formation with a stronger one. <a href="http://www.fifauteam.com/fifa-16-ultimate-team-formations">Source for counter formations</a>. Haven&#39;t tested this personally. Just can&#39;t be asked.</li>

They all play like Barcelona, they never get beat in the air, they seem to have a telepathic knowledge of your every move etc.</p>

<p>Well I recently started playing around with the slider settings and after using a community set that was being experimented on by the amazing folks over at Operation Sports it felt like playing a different game. Recently Matt10, the thread creator and Fifa mad scientist streamed a new set based off his favourite fifa 16 sliders. After making a couple of personal preference tweaks to it, I have to say this is honestly the most fun I&#39;ve had playing against the AI in career mode since maybe fifa 06 or 08. Teams play varied styles, they arent perfect with their passing anymore but still a threat, they get beat in the air if you have the right players and most importantly you can tackle and win the ball back from them without wanting to claw your eyes out.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest if any of you are getting too frustrated with FUT or playing the AI and want to try something different give this set a go, and I will state the specific sliders that are personal preference. All credit goes to Matt10 over on OS sports for this set, I am just relaying the information to you guys.</p>

<p>Slider Settings(User first)</p>

<p>Sprint Speed - 50/50</p>

<p>Acceleration - 49/49(can change to 48/49 if you want)</p>

<p>Shot Error - 50/55 (personal pref, can be 55/55 too)</p>

<p>Pass Error - 50/60 (personal pref, can be 50/55 or 55/60)</p>

<p>Shot Speed - 49/49 (personal pref for user, can be 50/49)</p>

<p>Pass Speed - 35/25 (This is crucial to a better game, highly recommend you stick to this)</p>

<p>Inj Freq - 50/50</p>

<p>Inj Sev - 50/50</p>

<p>GK ability - 50/50</p>

<p>Marking - 40/40</p>

<p>Run Freq - 45/45 (50/50 is fine too, I prefer this)</p>

<p>Line Height - 60/60  Line Length - 50/50  Line Width - 50/50</p>

<p>Full Back Pos - 20/25 (25/25 or 20/20 is fine too)</p>

<p>FT Control Error - 50/55 (Arguably personal pref, I like this)</p>

<p>I play on Legendary difficulty with 10 min halves and slow gamespeed. I recommend you try it with the same settings and later adjust according to your needs. Please feel free to leave any questions/feedback/abuse on how this worked out for you, I can say I&#39;m having a blast so far. </p>

<p>I&#39;m streaming these slider settings right now @ <a href="https://twitch.tv/TommyTyrantinho">My Twitch</a> if anyone is curious to see how they operate.</p>

<h2>The loan glitch. What it means and how to do it.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles('39v4pg')">View full post</button>
<div id="39v4pg" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve ever been underwhelmed by the development of a player you&#39;ve signed and can&#39;t understand why then hopefully this post helps!</p>

<p>Virtually everything involved in the loan glitch can be done in the squad status screen. Firstly I&#39;ll explain all of the &#39;statuses&#39; (stati?) and what they represent.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&#39;Recently joined from *** for ***&#39;. This will be a player&#39;s status who you have recently signed and will remain until the next transfer window.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;At the club since ***&#39;. This tells us that the player has a potential of less than 80.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Has that something special&#39;. The same as the status above, but only appears when the player has the flair trait.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Showing great potential&#39;. The player&#39;s potential is in the range of 80-84.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Exciting prospect&#39;. Potential is in the range of 85-89.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Has potential to be special&#39;. Potential is 90+ (technically 90-94 as potential cannot be higher than 94.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Make note of these. They are important!</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the loan glitch will not work effectively on every player. The criteria for players that we can effectively perform the loan glitch (ones that we are in control of) is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Must be aged 21 or under. If not the squad status screen will not show any status referring to their potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Their overall must be at least 60. If not, then again you won&#39;t be shown any status referring to potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Their current potential must be at least 70. This is important because the loan glitch can only alter a player&#39;s potential by 10 at the most. If the current potential is less than 70 it cannot go up to 80, therefore there is no status that tells is if it has changed. It is also important to note that when you sign a player his potential will change. So if you sign a player who has a potential of 75 it could drop to below 70 without you knowing. Keep this in mind if you are finding the glitch is not working.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I&#39;ll list the steps of how to perform the glitch.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pick the player you want to glitch, making sure he meets the criteria listed above and note his status.</p></li>
<li><p>Put him on the loan list. Doesn&#39;t matter of it&#39;s season or short, but it is cheaper to recall a player who is on a short loan.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for a loan offer from another team. Doesn&#39;t matter who it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept the offer.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Go into the squad status tab and find your player. The loaned players are at the bottom of the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Open your player&#39;s profile by clicking X or A.</p></li>
<li><p>Select &#39;recall from loan for ***&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>Back out of that screen by pressing O or B and scroll back up the list to find your player.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>His potential had now changed, it may have gone up or down. Refer to the status as mentioned above. If you are not happy with how the potential has changed, for example he was originally &#39;exciting prospect&#39;, but is now &#39;showing great potential&#39; then exit out of your career mode, load it up again and repeat steps 6-9.</p>

<p>It is easy to do. I have done this successfully to the same player multiple times in the same transfer window. Theoretically you could take a player with a potential of 70 and glitch him to 94. I haven&#39;t done this, but might give it a go.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Happy to answer any questions.</p>

<h2>Loan Glitch in FIFA 16 - Guide/FAQ</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of questions about the loan glitch and how it&#39;s changed. I&#39;m pretty sure I got it figured out, so figured I&#39;d share...</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the loan glitch?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/39v4pg/the_loan_glitch_what_it_means_and_how_to_do_it/">See here</a></p>

<p><strong>Is it still present in FIFA 16? is it the same?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s still there, but there&#39;s one major difference: instead of bumping a whole &#39;level&#39; of potential each time (Showing Great Potential to Exciting Prospect, for example), the potential now usually only changes 1-2 points. It can, in rare cases, jump 3-4 points (maximum is apparently 5) but this is rare.</p>

<p><strong>So what difference does it make?</strong></p>

<p>2 key differences:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bumping up players now takes a lot more time. If once you could make a 81 potential an 91-94 in 2 loans, now you&#39;ll need 5-7 loans, depending on how lucky you are. It&#39;s a lot more annoying now.</p></li>
<li><p>Players are capable of upgrading potential <strong>within a status</strong>. For example, if the potential jumps from 81 to 83, the player will remain &#39;Showing Great Potential&#39;. Meaning you can&#39;t use the status to figure out if the potential went up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Is there a workaround for this?</strong></p>

<p>For 1, not that I&#39;m aware - you&#39;ll simply need a lot more loans and patience.</p>

<p>For 2, luckily there is. </p>

<p>In FIFA 16, when a potential is chagned, <strong>the player value also rises/drops accordingly</strong>. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you loan out a player who&#39;s value is 6m, than recall him. If he comes back valued 5m, you know the potential decreased. If he comes back valued 6m, it&#39;s the same, and if it&#39;s 7m - you&#39;re succesful and his potential is raised.</p>

<p>It can also rise and drop different quantities - his value might go up by more money if his potential jumped more. Generally, the higher a player value is, the bigger the jumps/drops will be. So in that example, you might want to reload until there&#39;s a bigger jump - if the player comes back valued 7.5 or 8, you know his potential improved by more.</p>

<p><strong>What else does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>Well, you may have noticed we don&#39;t really need the player status anymore. Which now means that the loan glitch <strong>isn&#39;t limited to players under 22</strong> anymore. You can bump up anyone under 30. I&#39;ve had success bumping up potential of 25 and 26 years olds. Which makes the glitch a lot more useful.</p>

<p>Generally, if you&#39;re patient enough, you could make your whole team (players under 30) loan listed every transfer window - and bump the potential of each and every one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Is this method perfect?</strong></p>

<p>No, and there&#39;s still more to discover. The value trick doesn&#39;t always work - particularly, it doesn&#39;t work with really young players. I&#39;ve had youngsters (Aged 18) jump from &#39;Great Potential&#39; to &#39;Exciting Prospect&#39; without any value change. Other youngsters will only go down in value, but not up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not completely sure of what the exact rules are for young players, but I&#39;ve had a 100% success rate with players aged 20 or above.</p>

<p>If you have anymore questions, please ask.
Thanks for reading :)</p>

<h2>FIFA 17 Youth Academy & Lock To Player Style Career Mode Megathread</h2>

<div id="564jpa" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>FIFA 17 Youth Academy &amp; Player Lock Style Career Mode Megathread</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>This will be an evolving megathread about what I&#39;ve found about the FIFA 17 Youth Academy and the only way to play a RTG (road to glory) style career mode, &quot;Lock To Player&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Each year I pick a low level team with cool uniforms -- this year I&#39;ve selected Al Qadisiyah FC from Saudi Arabia-- and build them up from League 2. I also replace the worst League 2 European teams with the riches teams in the world then fill up then move them into the Premiere league (staring with my Real Madrid) and let the rest of the Premiere league teams fill out the Championship so once we win league 2 we have an ever-escalating challenge. Adding to that challenge is the fact that I only play with 1 player with great pace and a 4* or 5* weak foot rating (usually the best winger or ST/CF depending upon how the version of FIFA plays and if my team needs me in the center to score enough to be competitive -- FIFA 17 does not). I will sometimes get lucky and get a player early on with a 5* weak foot and good physical growth that I can play the entire career mode with.</p></li>
<li><p>I will return to this post throughout the hours, days, and months to come to post about the youth academy and the lock player lock career experience because I don&#39;t see anyone doing it how I want it done.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>My Current Team</h1>

<ul>
<li> Season 2 (Feb. 28th): I now have a FANTASTIC squad of 51 youth players 18 &amp; under and a full youth academy of quality players --including the 14 year old-- with a couple more players waiting in the youth reports. My current development strategy is to train their OVR to 60 and get them to Has Potential To Be Special then let natural progression take it from there for all but a specific few of them. I only keep players with good work rates, SPD of 67 or better (really 70) unless they are a CM/CDM, 5&#39;7 or taller (nearly all of starting XI is between 5&#39;10 - 6&#39;7), and at least 3* weak foot (for all players) except for 1 winger who is HPTBS and has great stats with a 2* weak foot and 4* skill moves.</li>
</ul>

<h1>General Observations</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>The scouts reload on the day your season starts now from what I can tell.</p></li>
<li><p>Scouts and their trips are slightly more expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Youth academy player weak foot ratings are DRAMATICALLY improved this year. I actually had 4 straight decent or high potential players from the same scout, my only scout at the time, with 5* weak foot yesterday. And defensive players (or non-attacking players) tend to have less weak foot and skill move ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Work rates seem more in line with players positions this year. Attackers are more likely to focus on attacking. And midfielders seem to have specific styles of play, often emphasized by their work rate.</p></li>
<li><p>The taller players are the lower their AGI and BAL stats tend to be. But, they typically have higher STA if they were the &quot;physically strong&quot; type when scouted (which they usually are).</p></li>
<li><p>Player&#39;s potential doesn&#39;t show if they&#39;re rated below 60 OVR.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Youth Academy Player&#39;s Stats &amp; Growth</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>14 year olds are in FIFA 17 (<a href="https://i.redd.it/y2pg1zhcwopx.jpg">https://i.redd.it/y2pg1zhcwopx.jpg</a>)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the top attributes and player value listed when you click on a scouted youth player before adding them to your youth academy to determine what caliber of recruit your dealing with. Value over $100K is a good starting point. Around $500K is 58-60 OVR.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Youth Players can now either play any of the 3 positions listed by a 5<em>5</em> scout or just the last 2 (left to right). More testing needed, But it&#39;s definitely not the middle position all the time any more.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It is possible for player&#39;s physical or skill stats to grow as much as +4 in a single month. Happens rarely, but it&#39;s possible. (+4 is the most I&#39;ve seen to this point, haven&#39;t noticed it in mental stats yet)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>There appears to be a cap on youth academy player SPD in the youth academy. I haven&#39;t seen a youth academy player go over 75 in the academy yet in 2 careers. They didn&#39;t appear to grow physically in the academy, but I need to do a lot more surviving with on this to figure it out officially.</p></li>
<li><p>CPU players doesn&#39;t appear to consolidate all their growth to May 1st this year. More info to come...</p></li>
<li><p>Physical growth isn&#39;t consistent this year because for the most part it&#39;s random whereas skill growth settles into different, clearly discernible patterns for different players. Physical growth is there, and it can be consistent, but due to the randomness it can often be slower than what would be ideal for youth academy players starting with OVR below 55-60+. I did get a star young striker to grow +7 SPD in 1 year in my 1st career with reloading and in my new career I have just grown a 17-18 year old 6&#39;6 CF (physically strong) +11 SPD in 1 season with 1 month left (+3 SPD on April 1st alone). The problem is many of his 16-18 year old teammates have grown between nothing at all to +3 SPD. And this is for players starting from 60 - 75 SPD. Still looking for SPD growth correlations or patterns... Something to help get it started because getting that 1st +1 can be hard.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>(UPDATE: The issue with growth appears to be that physical growth is more random than skill growth and harder to come by --which makes little sense for a 16 year old-- and lower rated players with high potential seem to be growing at the same rate as higher rated players with similar potential. I currently have a team of extremely highly rated players out of the academy with extremely high potential. I will be reporting back about their growth as I play through the seasons)</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hopefully there will be a patch for development of lowly rated youth player&#39;s with high potential. Physical stats and untrainable stats grow too slowly for these players especially, as does general growth overall. PI&#39;m seeing players who started with 46-54 OVR at 16 and 17 years old with Exciting Prospect and Has Potential To Be Special potential statuses rated in the 60s at 20 years old.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>I&#39;m testing the random month of may growth on my players who are still in the youth academy...</em></p></li>
<li><p>There is something really weird going on with physical progression. I&#39;ve used the simulation glitch to pass by the change of the month from July to August at least 15 times in a row now and most players show either a +1 to SPD or ACC or nothing at all, and no one with more than a +1 to their OVR. Hmmm...</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE: My players didn&#39;t grow for the month where I glitch simmed through the 1st of July 15 times or so. And they didn&#39;t grow on August 1st either. They did go back to growing on September 1st. Still testing...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TESTING: I&#39;m currently (10.4.016) simulating a few seasons ahead to see how my youth players grow and if they get a jolt to their physical stats somewhere down the line...</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>TESTING RESULTS: I simulated 2 full seasons ahead and saw similar growth to that of my 1st career. Has Potential To Be Special players are still typing out at around 70-74 OVR at 19-20 years old. This is in large part because their physical stats were still growing slowly. Fastest plates were 81-82. Now I&#39;m back to my session and I&#39;m going to scout a winger with the 75 SPD max and sim and re-sim each month focusing on that single player&#39;s physical growth. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Mental stats grow slowly for young players. Can&#39;t say if the mental growth picks up as they get older yet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There doesn&#39;t appear to be a &quot;yearly growth cap&quot; in any category this year. (But there does appear to be a SPD cap of 75 in the academy)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Still looking into this but there appears to be limited physical growth for youth players in the academy.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Scout Future Stars</h1>

<ul>
<li>Not worth using right now. Wait until they patch youth growth, etc. Then you&#39;ll get more bang for your buck. Either way, those players are no better or worse than the top talent you get through the academy regularly.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Youth Academy Player Type Notes</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Wingers produce the most consistently fast players, and the most LW/RW and a lot of CF, usually 66-75 SPD and ACC when between 50-65 OVR.</p></li>
<li><p>Technically Gifted, as of now, produces the most ST, a good amount of CF, and the most LM/RM, with some CM/CDM in there as well. Usually between 62-71 SPD/ACC.</p></li>
<li><p>Physically Strong produces a lot of tall players, ST, CF, CB, and LB/RB.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of where I play players by player type:</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>ST/CF = Winger, Physically Strong, Technically Gifted (train finishing stats)</p></li>
<li><p>LW/RW/LM/RM = Winger</p></li>
<li><p>CAM/CM/CDM = Playmaker, Technically Gifted, Physically Strong (train finishing stats -- barely effects OVR)</p></li>
<li><p>LB/RB = Physically Strong, Defensive Minded (train crossing, short passing, vision, and heading)</p></li>
<li><p>CB = Physically Strong (train heading and defending)</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Loan Glitch</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>The loan glitch works. Use the player value and potential rating if it&#39;s shown to manage it.</p></li>
<li><p>Players sometimes grow by as much as +2 in certain stat categories when returned from loans.</p></li>
<li><p>Players OVR can go up when returned from loan. (Usually coincides with their potential raising)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Players&#39; growth doesn&#39;t reset when loaned this year.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Players in good form can typically be loaned out enough to reach Has Potential To Be Special within 3 transfer windows. I had 1 winder get loaned out 4 times in 1 transfer window using the simulation glitch.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Simulation Glitch</h1>

<ul>
<li>I think the ability to get multiple months of progression by glitching to the next month and back has been nurfed. I&#39;ve consistently seen my players get either 1 month&#39;s growth or none at all. Once I didn&#39;t get any growth the next month either.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Financial Loan Glitch</h1>

<ul>
<li>Give a player a ton of money in weekly wages, then loan that player out on a short loan, then go into Office -&gt; Finances -&gt; Budget and make your Wage Budget $0, then pay the fee to recall the player. Viola, now you have more money and that player is back on your team. Rinse and repeat and your team is rich.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Transfer Deadline Glitches</h1>

<ul>
<li>This is something else I did last year that still works. If there are multiple open days left before transfer deadline day, if you do the simulation glitch then reload, transfer deadline day will show up on the day it reloads to. So, that means you get more time to make transfers, loans, etc. Also, if you enquire about a player at the end of deadline day they can be signed after the transfer window ends. This includes after the real deadline day. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Player Signing Potential Glitch</h1>

<ul>
<li>Player&#39;s potential change when you sign them from a new team or as free agents. Check their value before the signing and afterward to make sure it changes for the better.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Youth Player Wages</h1>

<ul>
<li>In contract extension talks youth players don&#39;t ask for the wages you would have to pay them if you signed them from another team or the free agent pool. They seem to ask for $200/week more than their currently being paid.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Youth Academy Player Training Tips</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Over training&quot; a specific skill can cause the player to gain momentum in the gritty of that particular skill and grow ASTRONOMICALLY in that stat in a single year. I&#39;ve repeatedly had players grow +20 or more points in a single season in FIN, BAC, DRB, etc. (+27 FIN is the highest I&#39;ve had so far). Once you get the ball rolling on that stat&#39;s growth and make it 1 of or the highest stat for the player it&#39;s almost as if the game sees it as the player&#39;s style and that stat or 2 or whatever blossoms at an astronomical pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to point 1, in the current season I&#39;m in I will be tracking the player&#39;s growth for what I suspect may be a user &quot;May bump&quot; or sorts. Somewhere in the later parts of the season my player growth changes, that much I know. I just don&#39;t know when or why. I&#39;m looking into it...</p></li>
<li><p>It appears the best strategy so far this year is to not train players in any stats that raise their OVR until they are much, much older to give the physical growth a chance to really kick in because they consistently grow tons physically when they&#39;re 16, 17, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually use this time to balance out their stats. So I raise defending stats for wingers. I raise free kick stats. And be sure to raise all your CM FIN and POW because they barely effect those player&#39;s ratings, but obviously make them dramatically better players to play with.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>&quot;Lock To Player&quot; Style Career Mode</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>UPDATE: FIFA has listened to the YouTube complainers way too much. When wanna be hardcore YouTube players score 2 goals in a game with terrible teams against terrible teams they complains the game is too easy. This is significant because every league in FIFA scores less goals, usually far less goals, in the game than they do in real life. ENGLISH LEAGUE 2 averages 3 goals a game. LEAGUE TWO!!! When was the last time you watched someone play 3 games FIFA on YouTube in an episode of their redundant series where 9 goals were scored? (That doesn&#39;t happen much.) And if there were, did they complain? (Of course they did. Cutzy just did it because he scored 3 goals in 1 game 1 time -- for the 1st time all season.) And like I said, FIFA hears these completely inaccurate voices and creates a game where I recently locked to 1 player and watched the ball suck to the computer&#39;s team nearly every touch of the ball EVEN AS I turned the sliders more and more against the computer&#39;s team. Myself and my teammates shoot nearly every shot directly at the goalie&#39;s feet and midsection, no matter where the goalie is standing in the net, with Goalkeeping set to 0. I then turned down the shot error to 25 and my team went on to fire LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ON TARGET SHOT DIRECTLY INTO THE GOALIE! What this is pointing out to you is that FIFA cheats the human team to an astronomical degree that can only really be seen when you lock to 1 player and watch your team get out of the way when the ball is bouncing to a computer player and lose LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE battle for the ball. I&#39;ve sat and watched my teammates make 9 straight passes DIRECTLY TO the computer&#39;s team after we&#39;d struggle seemingly endlessly to regain possession because EVERY SINGLE TIME we poked the ball away it went directly to a computer teammate or possession was regained by the computer player on the ball. THIS IS 100% A RESULT OF FIFA HEARING ALL THIS DUMBASS BITCHING ABOUT THE GAME BEING BROKEN IF THERE&#39;S SPACE ON THE FIELD AND IF THERE ARE ACTUALLY 3-4 GOALS PER GAME... LIKE IN REAL LIFE! Play some games locked to a player on a low level team playing against a team of equal talent and watch. Being cheated isn&#39;t simulation, fairness, or ok in any situation. And having things be harder than they should be isn&#39;t ok or helpful for you in any situation. And those who tell you that&#39;s the case or complain are, by definition, idiots and a part of the problem.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>UPDATE: Lock to player style cannot be played on legendary difficulty and every slider set (including operation sports&#39; community sliders -- horrible). The difficultly level itself slants EVERY SINGLE THING in the direction of the computer&#39;s team including speed, ball protection, 1st touch error, everything. Then the slider set will even set everything even or in the favor of the computer. Still today OS&#39;s sliders make the computer faster than the human team even though they already are. Complete bullshit. Put in their current settings, set the game to legendary difficulty, lock to your LW, and watch how your team gets 24% of the possession for the game if you don&#39;t play with a possession style where literally every pass and move is the most conservative choice possible. If you try to make any sort of a long pass or anything you will end up with 20%-36% possession and nothing higher. B.S. I will have to release some gameplay settings which will look HORRIBLE because they won&#39;t be in the favor of the computer and you all will cry and bitch and moan. But it has to be done.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>I switched to World Class, default settings, locked to player. Cheating all over field. Pass completion was 10% lower than the cpu. After 60 minutes they had 1 shot, 0 on target. I had 0 shots. All garbage. I&#39;m going back to Madden (which has the same issues, just with more manageable options) until an update is released or until I can figure out a way to work on Pro difficulty and have the CPU still have a change to score some goals. Completely disappointed in this B.S.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Since they introduced the lock to player feature (way back when I&#39;ve never played a single game of FIFA controlling the whole team. This is by far the best way to play the game and experience the finer points and beauty of the AI and physics of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>In my career mode I play each season with only 1 player and I let the CPU control the rest. This is MUCH BETTER than the way most people play their career modes because the &quot;storylines&quot; that build and etc. are actually true to the skill and style of your team, not the individual ability of the human player. When some player on the team of someone controlling every player &quot;can&#39;t score&quot; in front of goal that&#39;s THAT HUMAN PLAYING THE GAME not being able to score. The way I play, with just the 1 player, when players move into space or finish or choke in front of the net, or make great long passes, etc. it&#39;s actually them doing it. Whenever a great long pass connects I check the replay to make sure I know who made that pass because it wasn&#39;t me, it was actually that player and you can come to see how they play differently based upon their ratings and size. Playing this way on the PRO camera puts you ON THE TEAM, rather than autonomously being the team.</p></li>
<li><p>The sliders people put out aren&#39;t as great for this type of play though. when people play as literally every player on a team they generally gain an advantage over the CPU and ever year the sliders come to represent that. That advantage must be removed if you&#39;re playing player lock or else you will consistently feel the constant advantage the CPU players have over your CPU controlled teammates and it&#39;s MADDENING.</p></li>
<li><p>Other than that though you can genuinely play in a way that is FAR more engaging and creates a real story and team the way these RTGs and Career Mode YouTubers do not. Everything is just them playing everything then screaming &quot;This player can&#39;t play&quot; and etc. For the record, I told CUTZY to do this last year but he bitched about how, &quot;Nobody likes it and he can&#39;t afford to lose subscribers.&quot; That&#39;s code for, &quot;I&#39;m not creative enough to see just how much better what you&#39;re saying is than what I and everyone else has been doing. I told him that&#39;s not leadership, he didn&#39;t get that either. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see some player lock career mode series pop up once this gains popularity. I would&#39;ve started my own years ago, or even this year, but I can&#39;t make movies, play this game entirely too much, play Madden 17, play NBA 2k17, and make this series for you all right now. Not enough time in the day, week, or month. lol</p></li>

Over the years many of my contributions about career mode and the youth academy have been used without people knowing where they actually came from. That&#39;s another reason I started this thread.

<h2>Have you loan-glitched anyone to 'potential to be special' in 17?</h2>

<div id="d9owid1" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>Loads of times, yep.</p>

<p>I have a theory (which I&#39;m not sure anyone else believes in) as to why sometimes it seems next to impossible to get someone up to the next notch of potential (ie great potential to exiting prospect, or EP to HPTBS).</p>

<p>I&#39;m a complete loan glitch whore as I always have one career each FIFA (normally my first one) where I totally unrealistically try to get every player in my squad to the highest possible OVR, so I&#39;ve got a fair bit of anecdotal evidence to support this theory, but no hard evidence - I think there probably is a way to test and prove it, but I already believe it so I&#39;m not really bothered about convincing myself further.</p>

<p>Anyway, my theory is that not only can potential change when you bring players back from loan (or buy them), it can also change when you send them out (or sell them).</p>

<p>Consequently, sometimes when you loan someone out - let&#39;s say it&#39;s someone who&#39;s in your squad to begin with and you know their potential is exactly 87 - their potential drops by the maximum possible (say 4 points) when you loan them out. </p>

<p>So, once you&#39;ve loaned them, you save the game and try recalling, and no matter how many times you try, the best you can do is get them back at the same level they were before - because the maximum of +4 can only cancel out the original -4.</p>

<p>Of course, the most valid objection to my theory is that the value doesn&#39;t change when you loan them out - but maybe that&#39;s because they&#39;re now at another club so you just don&#39;t see it/know it. </p>

<p>Anyway, my way around this is to add another layer to the already tedious process of loan glitching which is to save the game BEFORE I&#39;ve accepted the offer (save 1) and then save again (save 2) after I&#39;ve accepted it. Then I do maybe three or four recalls using save 2 and if none of them are getting the player back in a better state than when I sent them out, I go back to save 1, accept the offer again, make a new save 2 and try again. That fails, do save 1 again, etc. until eventually you get what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>Fucking time consuming, but honestly, it does work for me.</p>

<p>Another thing - with younger players (17,18,19), a lack of value change doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the potential hasn&#39;t changed - sometimes it&#39;ll stay the same and the potential will go up to the next level. No idea why this is.</p>

<h2>How to cheat your way to extremely high rated players.</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just thought id share a method I havent seen on the sub on how to cheat your way to super high rated players within a season.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create a player in a position and nationality you want your player to be, make them as old as possible and set their rating very high. Their name and appearance, height, specific attributes, etc will be replaced by random during the process.</p>

<p>Step 2: This player will retire after the first season. This will create a &#39;regen&#39; (a young player generated by the game to replace the retired player, the &#39;regen&#39; <em>only</em> shares the <em>potential ability</em>, playing positions and nationality of the retired, everything else is randomised.</p>

<p>Step 3: Find the regen by searching 16-22 year olds of your nationality and position of choice. Proceed to be extorted for an undeniably world class player as he is generated at a random club within the league he retired.</p>

<p>Step 4: Buy the player. Put him in your team</p>

<p>Step 5: Bury the shameful feelings of cheating deep beneath 14 seasons of glorious goals.</p>

<p>Why go through the hassle of all this when you can create players freely at the rating you decide? So you can post on Reddit claiming your 98LW is totally natty cause he has an actual face. And you always make the player look shit/give him a shit name. </p>

<h2>Chance Creation drill</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is common knowledge but I&#39;ll post it here as it may help someone who struggles with this training drill in career mode.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve brought through about 3 strikers in my career mode &amp; noticed they&#39;ve all got awful finishing stats, so I decided the best way to boost that is by using the gold Chance Creation drill. However, I found when playing the drill myself it was difficult &amp; I kept on getting low ratings on it, barely growing my 53OVR player.</p>

<p>However, after playing it a few times through now I&#39;ve noticed that if you just pass and move up the pitch, you&#39;ll gain a lot of points simply from the passes themselves. If you do this enough you only need to score once or twice in the whole drill (which normally lasts 1 minute, 30 seconds). So try and pass between the players when you can, a pass normally earns you between 150-300pts. You&#39;re looking at about 9000pts overall for an A. Using this strategy I&#39;ve been consistently getting A&#39;s in this drill.</p>

<p>Hope it helps anyone else who&#39;s having trouble with this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering if anybody knows of any good signings for the first couple of seasons for League 2? I&#39;d imagine Barrow &amp; Harrogate are especially popular this year so hopefully you guys have some experience with good players with decent potential at that level. </p>

<p>As it stands, I&#39;ve signed; Nathan Wood (CB from Middlesbrough), Ricky Jade-Jones (ST from Peterborough) and then a Turkish striker called Faghir. </p>

<p>Any players you guys have found particular joy with?</p>
