<button onclick="toggles(403)">View full post</button><div id="403" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was talked about over with a friend and i want to show you guys my proposal.</p>

<p>The goal with this is to bring Bretonnians back in an AOS way, as well as tying them better into the theme of Fairy tales and the high fantasy of AOS. I hope you like it.</p>

<p><strong>The-World-That-Was</strong></p>

<p>In the World-that-Was, when Chaos rampaged across it, destroying it. While thier was still hope, however, the goddess Lileath, the goddess of Dreams protected aelves and men. She created the haven and ferried the souls and as many of her faithful as she could. </p>

<p>However, it was not to be so. Bel&#39;akor, the first Daemon Prince invaded, the Lady Slain, Haven cut off from the World-that-was as it was Destroyed...</p>

<p>But while cut off, and it&#39;s Lady Slain, it remained and it&#39;s people secure. The Gentle Lords and Ladies of Haven slowly rebuilt, their paradise providing, and soon the Lady Returned, fractured and yet still wonderous. They gathered the Lords and Ladies who embodied thier aspects and Created the Grail Courts to Organize and rebuild Haven.</p>

<p><strong>Journey to the Realms</strong></p>

<p>Haven was drawn to the Mortal realms soon after; the pull of the hopes and dreams of the realm&#39;s people drew it closer. It became a legend; the Fae-moon, as some would take to call it, would appear near the realms for one night or more, before vanishing as if it wasn&#39;t there at all... but there was a darker secret as well.</p>

<p>Children would be found missing; taken in thier dreams by the Gentle Lords and Noble Ladies of the Grail Courts and either replaced by a doubleganger spy or simply vanished. These children form the &#39;peasanty&#39; and servants of the Courts. To the Courts, this is an acceptable price; they need servants to tend to the gardens and tend to the flocks. The doublegangers also provide a service of allowing them to better understand the realms and it&#39;s people. Countless ages of isolation have altered the Lords. Indeed, it is difficult to call them human.</p>

<p>However this inhumanity leads to problems: Doppelgangers are never &#39;perfect&#39; imitations of those they take; they might have some minute flaw, or be left with a face that is too perfect, or lacking a birthmark, or even with wildly odd-colored hair. Those that see this as mutation will kill the child, or cast them out. those that survive and infiltrate provide information to their masters in their dreams. many are unaware that they are doublegangers, living and dying as if they were normal men, aelves, or duardin.</p>

<p><strong>Age Of Chaos</strong></p>

<p>Durning the Age of Chaos, the dreams of the mortals of the realms were interrupted and corrupted by nightmares of Chaos. The Remnants of Lileath realized that their kingdoms and people were in danger should Chaos ever discover them. They attempted to assist by rescuing many, opening up Haven Gates in certain locations, similar to realm-gates... however the fate that awaited many was not like the safety of Azyr; they make up the majoirty of the peasentry, forced to follow the strange an arcane way of the Grail Lords.  Thier treatment varies from dukedom to dukedom, but it is often a life of toil and drudge work.</p>

<p>However, the Armies of the Fae-Lords would not be unleashed into the realms while the Shards of Lieth still divided if this was yet another lost cause or an opportunity to avenge thier shattering. This debate would continue all the way through the age of Sigmar, the Necroquake until-</p>

<p><strong>Invasion of the Bad Moon</strong></p>

<p>The Bad Moon and the Fae Moon rarely cross paths, but when they do all-out war and madness both in Haven and upon the unfortunate realms they cross.</p>

<p>The First Clash was a major Shock to the Gentle Grail Lords, and panic rose among them as they saw pure madness and spite manifested. it was then the Knights and Paladins of the Realm rose in defense from troggoth and strange, alien lifeforms from the bad moon, but the infestation is said to still be rampant in many parts of the realm. </p>

<p>They first met in the Realmsphere of Ghur, the troggoth-herds wielding Lune-spite cursed weapons brought down many of the nobility and peasantry alike, and only the Shards managed to protect and defend thier realms from this second, traumatic invasion. With this grim reminder, the Forces of Haven make thier way against the forces of Destruction and Chaos. </p>

<p><strong>Culture and Society.</strong></p>

<p>Haven is divided into Five major areas, each guided by one of the Ladies. Beneath them are the Various Kingdoms, and beneath them thier fiefdoms.</p>

<p>the Ranking, from greatest to least is;</p>

<ul>
<li>The Shards of the Lady</li>
<li>The Lord /Lady Regent/King or Queen</li>
<li>The Consorts and priestess of Lileath</li>
<li>Princes and Gentry</li>
<li>Noble beasts and Steeds</li>
<li>The Taken Servants </li>
<li>The Serfs and descendants of serfs.</li>
<li>Ignoble beasts</li>
</ul>

<p>All are used as a part of the armed forces, though in different capacities: The Lord Regent is often a front-line general as well as the commander and strategist. The Consorts and priestess of The Lady are  the war mages, protected by the noble knights and protectors. The noble beasts are used as war-animals and mounts, while the Servants are either squires or mere cannon fodder for thier betters.</p>

<p>The Shards rarely take to the battlefields outside of Haven, however should they take the field they are slightly weaker then the Gods of the Realms... but to thier forces they are frightening demigods of the old myths.</p>

<p>While superficially beautiful and relaxing, Haven is still wrought with danger; it&#39;s folk are capricious and quick to anger and while they will be willing to help and guide newcomers thier wrath is easy to incur.</p>

<p><strong>The Shards and thier domains</strong></p>

<p>With her Division, the lands of Haven have been altered to fit the aspect of thier mistress. Their personalities color thier realms and it&#39;s people, but they are each connected.</p>

<p>The Lady of Foresight&#39;s Land is filled with vast lakes and gentle forests. It&#39;s Nobility being thoughtful, careful and relying greatly on subterfuge of doppelgangers. She is said to be constantly scrying the lakes and the stars of Azyr in other to guide Haven to it. It&#39;s people&#39;s colors are deep blue and green, armor a dusky silver. </p>

<p>the Lady of Fortune land seems to be eternally sunny; while this is little pleasure to it&#39;s hard working serfs and menials to the Nobles they are eternally hopeful and kind. They are supernaturally lucky and good fortuned, but this is due to the Lady&#39;s ability to shift thier poor luck to others. her people tend to have a rivalry with the Lady of Foresight.</p>

<p>The Lady of Faith is notable for training the priestess of all of the others. She is the most diplomatically minded, seeking to understand the other factions of the realm but her own nature prevents her from truly understanding. Her people tend to be studious, but zealous, almost to a violent degree. their Peasantry suffers under exacting, demanding knights who will slay them for daring to doubt thier lady&#39;s words and actions.</p>

<p>The Lady of Fae Moons is the most closely tied to haven itself; the noble beasts of Pegasi, hippogryphs, Haven-Drakes and the others are all under her domain. her people tend to love thier beasts, more so then even people. it is said some nobility have elevated some to their state, though this is denied. She detests the Lady of Dreams due to her seeking to interfere in the Realms more often they she believes strictly necessary.</p>

<p>The Lady of Dreams is a tragic figure. She Mourns the World-that-was and wishes to make the Realms into a copy of what it once was. Her people are ambitious and power hungry, while the peasantry cannot dissuade thier lords from any action. She has interfered the most in the realms, but this will also allow the forces of Chaos to remember her people and may spell the end for Haven yet.</p>

<p>The Domains however, each have different kingdoms beneath them, and they support their liege ladies in some from or another. To swear yourself to the Ladies, you must undertake a great quest, and should you succeed, you will be allowed to drink from thier Grails. Each grail has a different affect, and will ascended them (Should they be servants) into The gentle Lords and Ladies of Haven.</p>

<p><strong>Ecology of Haven</strong></p>

<p>The wildlife and plantlike of haven are bizarre and alien, even to people born in the realms. Survival and rules are constantly changing, even the wisest and most experienced Wanderers of the Aelfs would be lost and eaten before long. </p>

<p>the Most Noble beasts are the Haven Drakes: Dragons drawn into Haven and changed to be servants: butterfly wings and serpentine bodies mark them as different to thier kin. Thier breath is not fire but Dream itself, lulling it&#39;s foes to sleep. many have died only to rise again, and it is said they will only Fwilling allow an honorable knight to ride upon it.</p>

<p>Hippogryphs are wild and untamable, but that makes the challenge all the more interesting to some lords. Rarely willing, they can be charmed into service by a wise and clever knight.</p>

<p>Pegasai flocks are common in the meadows and forests. They will only allow those pure of heart to ride upon them but they are vicious in combat, similar to thier unicorn cousins. </p>

<p>Greater Ravens and Eagles are intelligent enough to speak but rarely intervene in the worlds of men or even the Lords, yet some have been charmed into service.</p>

<p>Lastly are the lions and Great wolves. both are highly intelligent, noble, and willing to help. Often used more as companions and advisors then pets and mounts.</p>

<p>lesser beasts, such as the Truffle-Pig, the songbrids and the ignoble pheasant live their as well, and are often hunted for sport. should a peasant be caught trying to kill or eat them without thier lord&#39;s permission, they will be stuffed with them until thy perish.</p>

<p><strong>Army</strong></p>

<p>A Lord Regent model: On foot and on a mount of your choice. Priests models for your army are the same.</p>

<p>Knight models follow suit, but you have your choice between the noble beasts (aside from Dragon and the Lions and wolves) </p>

<p>Squires and peasants take the place of things we all know and love...</p>

<p>lastly; A crystal alter of Lileath as an artillery piece.</p>

<p>What do you think? how to improve it?</p>

<h2>Apocrypha: Anoqeyån, the Divine-Tongue of the Old Ones</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/posixthreads </span><span class = "numcomments">9 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/pbtejy/apocrypha_anoqeyån_the_divinetongue_of_the_old/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(585)">View full post</button><div id="585" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Thus far in Age of Sigmar, we haven&#39;t gotten an answer as to why the Mortal Realms are named the way they are. Those who have followed the overall story of Warhammer Fantasy know that during the End Times, Archmage Teclis unbound the eight winds of magic (Azyr, Ghyran, etc.) from the Aethyr and bound them to eight incarnates (e.g. Sigmar becoming the incarnate of heavens).</p>

<p>While many Warhammer Fantasy fans understand the origins of the winds and therefore the Mortal Realms of Age of Sigmar, less actually know their meaning. As I will detail in this post, the names of the Mortal Realms are in fact derived from <strong>Anoqeyån</strong>, the divine language of the Old Ones, but it is more commonly known as the Dark Tongue, the language of Daemons. Whether the Old Ones learnt their language from Daemons or vice-versa is unknown, but source primarily point to the latter, which will be detailed later. Those of you more familiar with 40k may recognize a language known as <a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Enuncia">Enuncia</a>, the language of creation of the Old Ones, it is basically the same thing.</p>

<p>The primary sources we&#39;ll be using is <em>Liber Chaotica</em>, which in-universe is written by visionary/madman scholar Richter Kless, as well as <em>Words of Magic</em> found in <em>Inferno! Issue 45</em>, also in-universe written by Richter Kless as a follow-up to Liber Chaotica.</p>

<p>The real-world authors are <strong>Marijan von Staufer</strong> and Richard Williams, the former likely being the author of this post&#39;s subject matter. Marijan von Staufer is also an author for the 2<sup>nd</sup> editon Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay supplement: <em>Realms of Sorcery</em>, which is also a primary source for several of my posts on the nature of magic in Warhammer Fantasy/Age of Sigmar. I honestly can&#39;t find anything on this guy, unlike Simon Spurrier (author of 40k&#39;s Xenology) who remains an active fantasy/science-fiction writer who still interacts with fans. So this means we can only really work with what we&#39;re given, unless another GW author wants to expand on the old lore. The best bet would be Dan Abnett for reasons described later.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Origins of Daemons</h1>

<p>Here, I would like to post the final excerpt of Richter Kless&#39; exchanges with the First Supreme Patriarch of the College of Magic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Powers speak, the Universe listens, for the Universe is little more than Form imposed upon Chaos, or the Realisation of Potential. The image of that Form, the expression of that Realisation, is determined through action, consciousness, and will, represented in the unimaginaly complex Great Language of Gods and Daemons, known to mortals as Anoqeyån.</p>

<p>The incalculable powers of Gods are in one (admittedly simplistic) sense a reflection of the fact that they are personifications of concepts, and therefore the gods are actually manifestation of broad areas of divine language in the sense that the language itself is the result of conceptualisation. For example, mercy is an action and abstract with no identity until it is actually named &#39;Mercy&#39;, and the attributes of what makes mercy are expressed, codified and debated - so one might say it is with the gods.</p>

<p>Metaphysical Vortices of rage or despair may form in the Empyrean as mortal beings experience these feelings, but I believe that these Vortices are blind and devoid of identity and independent will until intelligent beings in the Mortal Realms become self aware enough to analyse their own raw feelings, bind them into concepts by assigning them names and identifying their attributes, and thereby give these emotions, and by direct association their Vortices with the Empyrean an identity separate from the actual mortal experience of them.</p>

<p><em>Inferno! Issue 45</em>, pg. 40</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a lot to take in, but essentially the idea is that emotions alone are not sufficient enough to create daemons, as we know daemons require names. Magister Volans believes the greatest of daemonkind are those that embody the most vast concepts, while smaller daemons embody minute concepts and can therefore can only babble like children in the divine tongue.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Magister Volans does not believe even the Old Ones could comprehend every the ever-growing language of Anoqeyån. Anoqeyån is a language that continuously expands, for it is a language of concepts and concepts may merge and divide into new concepts infinitely. However, the final Magister of the White Order (College of Light) believes quite the opposite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Magister Kant believes that the language was indeed the creation of the Old Ones. They were, he believes, the first and only beings to fully identify and quantify every single thing, state and process in this universe, and almost every single thing, state and process that was possible through and in chaos.</p>

<p><em>Liber Chaotica</em> - On Matters Arcane and Magical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were a Seraphon player I would be absolutely giddy reading this. In 40k, the Old Ones were simply the first sentient races in the galaxy, forming a confederation and building the webway before the C&#39;tan exterminated them and they devolved into lesser races such as the Slanni and Snotlings. However, the Old Ones of Warhammer Fantasy and Age of Sigmar are truly transcendent beings, almost horrific in their scale of advancement. It is clear that even at the height of the Grand Alliance of Order, the eight gods of the Mortal Realms could never hope to surpass the Old Ones.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Vowels and Consonants</h1>

<p>First, we need the defined list of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/tP82hjx">vowels</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/whmVgFI">consonants</a>, which I have just linked to. When it comes to the Dark Tongue/Anoqeyån, the subtle differences in sounds actually matters. In fact, Richter Kless specifically adds a warning for certain words, because mispronouncing them slightly can have dangerous effects. In Dan Abnett&#39;s Eisenhorn/Ravenor/Bequin series, a character who mispronounced a word of Enuncia and ended up blowing his teeth out.</p>

<p>Some subtle differences in pronounciation that can carry major conseuences can be seen in the difference between k and q. To an English speaker (like me), they sound the same, but to an Arabic speaker they are two distinct sounds, which each have a separate letter in the phonetic alphabet of Arabic.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Colors of Magic</h1>

<p>This is the topic that first drew me into the subject. Here is what the names of the mortal realms actually translate to:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Phonetic Spelling</th>
<th>Standard Spelling</th>
<th>Translation</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Aqʃi</td>
<td>Aqshy</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Orç</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Azir</td>
<td>Azyr</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xamön</td>
<td>Chamon</td>
<td>Yellow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giran</td>
<td>Ghyran</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sliv</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>Pink</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ʃyiʃ</td>
<td>Shyish</td>
<td>Purple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gur</td>
<td>Ghur</td>
<td>Brown</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ulgu</td>
<td>Ulgu</td>
<td>Grey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dar</td>
<td>Dhar</td>
<td>Black/Dark</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hyiʃ</td>
<td>Hysh</td>
<td>White</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Qayʃ</td>
<td>Qhaysh</td>
<td>Spectrum</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So the names of the realms translate to colors. Azyr is blue, Ghur is brown, Hysh is white and so on. Surely that seems silly, the mortal realms to essentially be a cheap crayon pack, but this is not exactly the case. They don&#39;t exactly translate to colors, but rather the symbolic significance of these colors.</p>

<p>In the old <em>Realms of Chaos: The Lost and Damned</em> book, it is noted that there is a separate word for the color red: <strong>Aqsh</strong>. So the realm of Azyr isn&#39;t the <em>blue realm</em>, but rather the realm that embodies the symbolic significance of the color blue, although blue is likely a popular color in Azyr.</p>

<p>On that note, you may notice four colors that don&#39;t have associated realms, which I&#39;d like to discuss here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orç - This one is very, very interesting. It is by far the most unusual thing I&#39;ve seen in the lore in a while. It is clear that the author intended to convey that Orç (likely spelled Orch) is supposed to represent the color of Orc magic, which is weird because Orcs are green.</li>
<li>Sliv - I have no idea what this is, but in the Lost and Damned book, Shyish used to be Purple <strong>and</strong> Pink, so this is new. If anyone has any more background on this I&#39;d love to here it.</li>
<li>Dar - Dhar is simply Dark Magic. In fact, we already have a Realm of Dhar, it is called the Realm of Chaos. The rune for Dhar (which I&#39;ll post about later) is literally the eight-pointed star of Chaos.</li>
<li>Qayʃ - Qhaysh is high magic. It was never its own unique wind, but rather a combination of multiple winds working in perfect unison. If such a realm existed, it would have been the Allpoints, whose nature was inverted and now spreads corruption to the Mortal Realms. The rune for Qhaysh is the inverse of the star of Chaos. Eight lines converging into one, alternatively a perfect circle with a whole dot at the center.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: After actually reading on the topic of colors, it seems that brown is simply a shade of orange, and &quot;all pinks are magenta and all magentas are purple&quot;, to quote <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/226940/what-is-pink-and-what-is-magenta">this detailed answer on the topic</a>. So really, the eight colors of magic, plus black and spectrum, essentially capture all types of colors.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Deviated Pronunciations</h1>

<p>Unlike Arabic, where related words are rooted on consanants, related concepts are rooted in approximate pronunciation. For example, from the <em>Lost and Damned</em> book we are given the following example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aqshy - Red</li>
<li>Aqshy&#39;y - Bronze or brass</li>
<li>Aqsh - Red</li>
<li>Akhash - Blood</li>
<li>Akh - Battle, bloodshed, to slay in battle</li>
<li>Aksha - Battleaxe</li>
<li>Ksy - Key or solution</li>
<li>Iakash - Lock or obstacle</li>
<li>Akhshami - Secret</li>
<li>Aksho - To seek</li>
<li>Akhamshy&#39;y - Slayers of warriors</li>
<li>Akami - Guardians</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see, that slightly changin A<strong>q</strong> to A<strong>kh</strong> changes the meaning from red to blood/warriors. You can clearly see the connection to <strong>Kh</strong>orne here, and why the Blood God would be so interested in Aqshy.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Orç</h1>

<p>I want to follow up a bit on the potential magic of &quot;Orç&quot;, the list of Anoqeyån words only shows two words that may be considered similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ulrax - Savage</li>
<li>Urak - Enemy</li>
</ul>

<p>So Orruk seems to translate to enemy, and certainly Orruks are known for wanting to make an enemy out of everything including each other. Similarly, they are savage. This is what leads to me to believe Waaagh! magic is a unique strain of magic related to the color orange.</p>

<p>Orruks, while they are heavily associated with Ghur, don&#39;t exactly encompass the concept of Ghur that I describe <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nib9x6/the_lores_of_magic_part_iii_ghur/">here</a>. Ghur encompasses the primal instinct, the need to struggle and survive. Orcs/Orruks just like to fight for fighting&#39;s sake. Humans fight to live another day, while Orruks fight to fight another day. This is even reflected in the various spell lores of the Orruks, whose spells are all focused on pummeling an enemy.</p>

<p>This also explains why Orcs in Warhammer Fantasy possessed their own unique spell list. To clarify, if Azyr is the Lore of Heavens, Orch is the Lore of Waaagh!</p>

<hr/>

<h1>More Interesting Words</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Qeyos (Chaos/Khaos) - literally means spirit energy, psychic power or magic. However, the contextual variations include &#39;Oversoul&#39;, abode of the gods, Sea of Souls, the Afterlife, the Aethyr, Paradise, and Hell</p></li>
<li><p>Leth, neth - Lord/Master/Ruler of</p></li>
<li><p>Kurnas - Hunter : Kurnous was the Elven god of the hunt. Kurnoth, a similar being, would therefore mean <em>Lord of Hunters</em></p></li>
<li><p>Gor - Beast: Remember that Ghur is the realm of beasts, and Ghur means (conceptual) brown. This means that Gors, children of Chaos, must have been named by their Gods.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s many more, but these are the ones that stood out to me.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I started this post, because I&#39;ve been writing a series on the lores of magic in Age of Sigmar, and I feel that it&#39;s incomplete without this sort of background. In this post we got much greater insight into the nature of the Old Ones, their language, and the origins of the names of the realms. Reviewing what we&#39;ve read, we&#39;ve learned that concepts do not truly manifest within the Aethyr until a name is given. Given that daemons do not name themselves, this implies one thing:</p>

<p>The 8 winds of magic, and therefore the Mortal Realms, are in fact a creation of the Old Ones. Azyr is Azyr because the Old Ones creating the concept of the Lore of Heavens and named it <em>Azyr</em>. Alternatively, perhaps they only named the base root words, and these words formed together to form the magic that is Azyr as well as the other colours of magic.</p>

<p>Finally, this leads me to question the true nature of the Mortal Realms. We know at their centers, there are simply normal civilizations and lands, but could these realms themselves possess some sort of sentience? Consider the nature of endless spells, considered daemons of the mortal realms. Also consider the <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Incarnate_Elemental">Incarnate Elementals</a>, destructive fragments of the realms themselves. If Khorne (Qarneth) embodies the concepts of rage, hate, and violence, could there be an Azyrneth, Ghyraneth, Shyishneth looking upon their realms from the edge?</p>

<p>There are so many things left unanswered. If the Aethyr transcends all realities, and the Old Ones are the source of the language that formed the Aethyr as we know it in Age of Sigmar, does that make them the oldest beings in existence? Or could it be that there are multiple cycles of Chaos annihilating all existence and wiping itself out in the process only for everything to repeat? What happened to the other colors of magic, orange and pink?</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna end my ramblings here. In the next post, I&#39;ll be discussing the symbols of the Mortal Realms, and the nuanced meaning to them. I&#39;d appreciate if anyone knew any more background information on the topic discussed here in the meantime.</p>

<h2>The Lores of Magic - Part IV - Azyr</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/posixthreads </span><span class = "numcomments">19 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/obd5n7/the_lores_of_magic_part_iv_azyr/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(617)">View full post</button><div id="617" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In part 4 of my series, following my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nib9x6/the_lores_of_magic_part_iii_ghur/">analysis of Ghur</a>, I now continue on to analyzing the realm and magics of Azyr, the realm of heavens and celestial magic.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Lore of Heavens</h1>

<p>Azyr is actually the more easily explained winds of magic. It encompasses knowledge and possibilities, and all the implications thereof.  Here is Soulbound&#39;s description of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celestial Magic</p>

<p>The magic of Azyr rises like a storm, then slips away as a gentle rain. It is the crash of thunder and the shimmer of the stars. One reads the future with the magic of the heavens — it holds the power of foresight, fate, and the wrath of the cosmos.</p>

<p><em>Age of Sigmar Roleplay: Soulbound - Corebook</em>, pg. 261</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, why does the magic of Azyr capable of summoning storms, rains, and winds. Certainly if it was limited to bringing down comets (one of it&#39;s signature spells), we could at make the connections between heavenly bodies and fate (astrology). It is certain that the concept of Azyr is derived from the pseudoscience of Astrology, but the reason it&#39;s associated with storms is more clearly explained in the old Warhammer Fantasy lore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Azyr: The Blue Wind</p>

<p>Azyr is said to be a manifestation of the Aethyr’s reflection of inspiration and that which is out of reach. The magic of this Wind is based upon knowledge of the unknowable and the manipulation of the skies. This Lore of the Heavens (also known as Astromancy) is practiced by Magisters of the Celestial Order to divine the future and pluck the strands of fate.</p>

<p>Azyr has few temporal boundaries and supposedly reaches into all the possible futures as readily as it floats across physical distances. <strong>After passing into the mortal realm, Azyr is said to be drawn into the upper portions of the heavens, becoming a haze of eerie cloud, visible only to those who posses witchsight (the ability to actually see the Winds of Magic). This association with the sky gives Celestial Wizards their power over Storms, flight, and mighty hurricanes.</strong> As the Blue Wind blows from the timeless realms of the Aethyr across the distant sky, it supposedly appears as a clouded window through which Azyr’s Magisters can predict certain events. It apparently can be sensed by the manner in which the permanent celestial bodies are distorted by the drifting cloud of Azyr’s impermanent and temporally distorting blue light.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition: Realms of Sorcery</em>, pg. 32-33</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there&#39;s the explanation, which is hinted at in Soulbound. Azyr is timeless, and reaches into all possibilities and across space, and therefore reaches far into the heavens and into the skies. The fact that the Lore of Heavens may summon lightning merely has to do with the fact that celestial magic rises into the sky.</p>

<p>You will find many magics are explained in this fashion. For example, the wind of Shyish blows from the past and into the future, where death awaits. The wind of Ghur can blow like a gentle breeze or a raging typhoon like an untamed beast. The wind of Hysh is diffuse and spreads into all things like light. The wind of Ulgu blows in like a fog, and so on and so forth.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Time and Azyr</h1>

<p>What does it mean when Azyr is described as having <em>few temporal restrictions</em>? Time in the mortal realms is an interesting thing, as we know time can flow differently in different realms. For example, time is twisted upon itself in Shadespire, and in the Chamonite sub-realm of Golgeth time actually moves slower. We also know that many in the mortal realms use an Azyrite calendar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Azyrheim Calendar</p>

<p>Like much of the Mortal Realms, the Great Parch uses the Azyrheim calendar. This calendar has a seven-day week, with roughly 30 days in a month. Each day is between 26–30 hours depending on where you are in the Mortal Realms — <strong>the time fluctuates depending on the frequency that the realmspheres of Hysh and Ulgu ascend and descend in power. This is known as the Dance of the Spheres.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what does this actually mean? Are Ulgu and Hysh circling each other at alternating frequencies thus affecting the length of the day? Or are the twin realms actually circling each other at a constant rate, but perceived to be changing frequency due to the difference in time within the realms? Does this imply that Azyr time is somehow a more coherent metric of keeping time? Or is Azyr time simply refer to a standard of measuring time, regardless of whether it is coherent with other realms, similar to how time in the real world is experienced differently at different points in space?</p>

<p>Regardless of the answers to any of these questions, we know that Azyr&#39;s nature of being the magic of possibilities allows it alter fate and divine possible futures, and therefore is the closest thing to time magic. However, going back to the old Warhammer Fantasy lore, <strong>&quot;Azyr has few temporal boundaries&quot;</strong>. This implies that some temporal limits exist, and there is an obvious one: it cannot alter the past. Azyr is the wind and magic of possibilities, which is always forward facing. You may use it to divine the future, but not see into the past. You may use it to alter fate, but not break causality and revert a past event. You may speed up or slow down the wheels of time, but you cannot reverse them. So while Azyr is often associated with time, it is not the magic of time, and it is not even the only wind of magic that can alter time either.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conceptual Understanding</h1>

<p>We immediately understand several things about Azyr:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is associated with knowledge and foresight because it reaches into all possibilities</p></li>
<li><p>It is associated with storms because the magic/wind reaches into the winds</p></li>
<li><p>It is associated with heavenly bodies (like comets), again because it reaches into the heavens, but also because it is Warhammer Fantasy&#39;s take on astrology</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, as with the other lores of magic, it goes deeper than that. The ability to alter or foresee fate is equally as dangerous as being able to break causality (alter past events). This is exemplified in the story of <em>Raphael Julevno</em>, the final Magister Patriarch of the Celestial College prior to the End Times. He was appointed the magister of this college, not because the college magisters actually debated and discussed the matter, but because they saw that he would become the Magister Patriarch. This paradox is a matter that would greatly disturb the Magister Patriarch.</p>

<p>So the magic of Azyr isn&#39;t just about reaching into all possibilities, but it&#39;s the power to create new possibilities. It&#39;s the power to shape not just this reality, but essentially to create new ones.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Spells</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Lore_of_Heavens">spell lore</a> reflects the conceptual understanding presented in the previous section. We of course have the classic spells:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chain Lightning - Wizard casts lightning, either from their hands or the sky</p></li>
<li><p>Comet of Casandora - Caster brings down an actual comet. Not quite sure what Casandora is though</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The we have the more prophetic spells:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Foretell Doom - The caster alter&#39;s the target&#39;s fate to spell their doom. This spell was called Fate of Doom in the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition RPG.</p></li>
<li><p>Glimpse - Looking into the near future. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition fantasy RPG, we had the Portents of Amul spell, which was split into three levels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are funny ways this spell lore can also be used. For example, it can be used to predict the weather, which is double-dipping into the aspects of Azyr. Overall, the spell lore tells us what we already know, but the endless spell is far more interesting.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Endless Spells</h1>

<p>There is also the one Azyrite endless spell: <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Chronomantic_Cogs">Chronomantic Cogs</a>, which is magical manifestation of the cogs of time. They are described as moving in rhythm with the heavenly bodies. This again links the movements of the heavens and constellations with fate and time (e.g. astrology).</p>

<p>In the fast-moving smaller cog, one can glimpsed rapid sunrises and sunsets, while in the largest clog one can glimpsed the rise and fall of civilisations over great aeons. As discussed earlier, the magic of Azyr is forward-looking, it cannot look into the past. In line with this, one cannot reverse the motion of the Chronomantic Cogs, only accelerate them and slow them down. When accelerated, motion around its user becomes a blur as time begins to move more quickly, while slowing down the cogs brings everything around the user to a near standstill.</p>

<p>The fact that the cogs moves with the rhythm of the heavens is particularly interesting. If the power of Azyr grants one the ability to move these cogs, and these cogs move with the rhythm of the heavens, then that implies that turning them moves the heavens themselves. This would suggest that Azyr isn&#39;t simply influencing the heavens, but rather it is chained to the heavens themselves. The heavens pull upon Azyr just as much Azyr pulls upon the heavens, thus the heavenly bodies are tied to fate itself.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Faction Design</h1>

<p>I never really gave the Seraphon much thought beyond the fact that they&#39;re the Lizardmen from the Old World who settled in Azyr. However, I can now see that Azyr has affected more than their spell lores, but how the Seraphon operate as a whole. Previously, the Slann of the Old World were content to just wait around in their jungles trying to listen for messages from the Old Ones. Now, the Slann have become far more involved in the greater picture, constantly working to manipulate fate to their own ends. When the Bad Moon first arose, the Slann had found that it&#39;s presence has obfuscated the glimpses into the future that they scry from their readings of the heavens, and then proceeded to send ships in the direction of the Bad Moon to stop it directly.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Azyr represents possibilities and with it the power of knowledge, fate, and foresight. It spreads upwards into the heavens where it links itself. Thus the heavens are tied to fate as Azyr is tied to the heavens. It spell lore therefore broadly covers abilities related to astronomy, astrology, fate, time, knowledge, heavenly bodies, storms, and the weather. Being a lore of possibilities, it has the power to make and unmake reality by plucking at the strands of fate and rearranging the heavens, something that the Seraphon have come to embody. To the individual, Azyr is the power of one&#39;s ability to decide their own fate and expand the number of paths they may walk upon.</p>

<h2>The Lores of Magic - Part III - Ghur</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/posixthreads </span><span class = "numcomments">14 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nib9x6/the_lores_of_magic_part_iii_ghur/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(618)">View full post</button><div id="618" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In part 3 of my series, following my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/n32i2k/the_lores_of_magic_part_ii_chamon/">analysis of Chamon</a>, I now continue on to analyzing the realm and magics of Ghur, the realm of beasts and amber magic.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Lore of Beasts</h1>

<p>Ghur, the Lore of Beasts, and Amber Magic is at first glance not particularly interesting, and often some wonder what the difference is between Ghur and Ghyran, being that both are <em>wild</em>.  Here is Soulbound&#39;s description of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amber Magic</p>

<p>The magic of Ghur, wild and ravenous. It stalks through humid vales and strikes from hidden caves. It is the strength of predators, the cunning of prey. It is primal, holding secrets of the wilds and beasts; feral and animalistic in form, all the better to join, or escape, the hunt.</p>

<p><em>Age of Sigmar Roleplay: Soulbound - Corebook</em>, pg. 261</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition Warhammer Fantasy description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ghur: The Brown Wind</p>

<p>Ghur has been called the Aethyr’s wild and bestial spirit. Ghur is used by the feral Amber Wizards to shape spells of beastcraft and communion. In strange shamanic rites, these Magisters can call Ghur into their bodies, allowing it to shape them into wolves and ravens, clawed savages and gentle horse whisperers. It is known as a savage wind, the antithesis of civilisation and domestication, as primal and unreasoning as it is devoid of malice. Ghur is attracted to animals and wild places in equal measure, retreating from the ordered existence of man and his cities. This is reflected in the misanthropic ways of the Amber wizards—shunning civilization for the wild mountains and moors, when the Wind of Ghur blows free.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition: Realms of Sorcery</em>, pg. 34</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description of Ghur is concise and straightforward. It is savage, primal, feral, untamed, but it is devoid of malice. Above all, it is known to be attracted to animals, which gives us strong hints to help us derive an esoteric understanding.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conceptual Understanding</h1>

<p>Something that separates higher beings, such as humans, from animals is the depth to the emotions that we use to express ourselves. Greater passions, which fall within the providence of Aqshy, are often described as complex combinations of our base emotions. Meanwhile, Ghur seems to describe the base, primal emotions.</p>

<p>For reference, here is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/591px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png">Robert Plutchik&#39;s Wheel of Emotions</a>, but there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_classification">other systems of emotional classifcation</a>. Regardless of the system, the base emotions include joy, fear, sadness, and anger. Emotions that any common beast or animal can possess. I personally prefer Plutchik&#39;s system as it includes emotions more relevant to our discussion, as it includes the notion of &quot;vigilance&quot; as a base emotion.</p>

<p>Going beyond that, these emotions represent our most <em>primal instincts</em>, which dominate the emotional spectrum of beasts, but come hard-wired within all intelligent beings. Our fight-flight-freeze responses, the ecstasy of a hunt, and the mourning of a lost comrade or kin. It is by understanding these basic emotions that one can feel kinship with beasts. It isn&#39;t merely emotions, but basic reactions and cunning that are ingrained deeply into one&#39;s being. For example, how prey such as gazelle will kick their back-legs into the air when being chased to avoid capture; this is something they likely do without thinking. Another example is the primal feeling of hunger, perhaps the most basic instinct of all. Indeed, this is reflected in the spell lore as well.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Spells</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Lore_of_Beasts">spell lore</a> reflects the conceptual understanding presented in the previous section. Besides the spells that include transorming into a beast or calling upon beasts, we have the following spells:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cower - Triggers a fawn response in a beast, binding them to one&#39;s will</p></li>
<li><p>Farsight and Prey&#39;s Vigilance - Increases the vigilant abilities of a hunter</p></li>
<li><p>Slip the Snare and Stalker&#39;s Cunning - Activates cunning of a wizard in the position of prey and hunter</p></li>
<li><p>Predatory Hunger - The wizard replenishes themselves upon the killing of an enemy. In regards to this one, it is worth recalling that there is no malice within the magic of Ghur. Ghur is the drive to survive, not to harm, even if that&#39;s a consequence of surviving.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is also the one Ghurish endless spell: <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Ravenak%27s_Gnashing_Jaws">Ravenak&#39;s Gnashing Jaws</a>, which is magical manifestation of never-ending hunger. I personally suspect Ravenak to be an incarnation of the Great Maw of Warhammer Fantasy, but that&#39;s another topic altogether.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Ghur represents the most primal instincts and emotions, which are bestial in the sense that they dominate the behaviors of beasts. It is wild in that these primal instincts are so ingrained into one&#39;s being that they cannot be controlled easily. These include the primary emotions of fear, anger, vigilance, and the basic instincts of fight, flight, and hunger. It’s with the understanding of these primal urges that one can better understand the beast and eventually learn to tame them, as well as summon the <em>beast</em> within one&#39;s self. The array of spells within this lore of magic likewise support this notion.</p>

<p>The Lore of Beasts is not so easily written off as just concerned with beasts and hunting. It also represents cunning and survival against the odds. It is also deeply introspective in that it delves deep into what drives a person on a most basic level. So while it may seem brutish, it is in fact a manifestation of one&#39;s core nature.</p>

<h2>The Lores of Magic - Part II - Chamon</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/posixthreads </span><span class = "numcomments">8 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/n32i2k/the_lores_of_magic_part_ii_chamon/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(619)">View full post</button><div id="619" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In part 2 of my series, following my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/mvw2zr/the_lores_of_magic_part_i_ulgu/">analysis of Ulgu</a>, I now continue on to analyzing the realm and magics of Chamon, the realm of metal and gold magic.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Lore of Metal</h1>

<p>Chamon, the Lore of Metal, and Gold Magic is perhaps the most difficult to write about, as its overall description and spell lore leaves little room for interpretation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gold Magic</p>

<p>Heaviest of all the energies, the magic of Chamon concerns the secrets of metal, the power to enhance it, or destroy it. It is the art of transmutation, the mystery of alloys, the possibilities of deft alterations. It is the magic of alchemy, and of technology.</p>

<p><em>Age of Sigmar Roleplay: Soulbound</em> - Corebook, pg. 261</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of all the lores of magic, Chamon is perhaps the most difficult to understand at a conceptual level. The list of spells within the <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Lore_of_Metal">Lore of Metal</a> aren&#39;t too helpful either in granting a deeper undersanding of Chamon. The spells encompass, as the above excerpt states, the power of transmutation and other general metal-related spells. However, we can instead pull what we understand about alchemy to extract deeper meaning from what we know about Chamon.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conceptual Understanding</h1>

<p>Like the lores of magic, alchemy (as we know it) is likewise two-fold in nature, and it is from this that we can better understand Chamon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Great Work of alchemy was intimately bound up with the whole religious and philisophical background, and for many who practicsed it the transmutation of metals was symbolic of the transmutation of imperfect man into a state of perfection.</p>

<p>Eric John Holmyard. <em>Alchemy</em>. 1995. p.156</p>

<p>The worker should in short look upon the mere transmutation of base metals into gold as a secondary object, subsidiary to the transmutation of the soul.</p>

<p>Eric John Holmyard. <em>Alchemy</em>. 1995. p.158</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message is clear: Chamon symbolizes the transmutation of the soul. This is certainly gives Tzeentch a good cause for desiring this particular realm. Where Chamon represents change in the direction of purity, Tzeentch represents change in the direction of corruption. In a sense, Chamon itself is pure anathema to Tzeentch. This is somewhat hinted at in its description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Realm of Metal is ever shifting, but certain sub-realms abide, giving shape to the so-called Lands of Gold. Chamon is not a set of plates, islands or continents crystallised in the central plane of the realmsphere, but rather a dizzying variety of domains that hang in the Chamon firmament, each linked to the others by portals and mystical bonds. In Azyr it has been <strong>depicted as the laboratory of some godly alchemist, glittering with potential and hope.</strong>...Though much of Chamon is metallic in nature, <strong>it has verdant reaches and pure water in abundance</strong></p>

<p>Warhammer Age of Sigmar 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition Core Book - Chamon, Realm of Metal, pg. 102</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h1>Endless Spells</h1>

<p>In the case of Chamon, I won&#39;t bother reviewing the spell lore, because they are <em>exoteric</em> in nature, as Holmyard would describe it. I&#39;ll instead focus on the one Chamon-coloured endless spell: <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Quicksilver_Swords">Quicksilver Swords</a>. To summarize, these are swords of quicksilver (mercury) that swing about seeking justice, especially against the agents of Chaos, believed to be formed from by the will of an ancient smith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The daughter of a ninemage, she imbued her creations with a portion of her body and soul, casting a single hair from her own head within the heart of each blade. Thus forged, the weapons were able to cut not only through metal, flesh and bone, but also through the souls of those they struck.</p>

<p>Malign Sorcery - Quicksilver Swords, pg. 29</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that these swords are quicksilver is interesting. In alchemy, mercury/quicksilver has a deeper symbolic meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On what we may call orthodox alchemy, Paracesus has comparatively little to say. Believing that the universe as a whole and all the objects in it were endowed with life, he peopled intermediate state between the material and the immaterial with beings consisting of a body and spirit, but no soul... As to material substances, he considered them to be ultimately composed of the four Aristolian elements, but immediately of the three primary bodies, <em>tria prima</em>, namely salt (body), sulphur (soul) and <strong>mercury (spirit)</strong>.</p>

<p>Eric John Holmyard. <em>Alchemy</em>. 1995. p.174</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spirit, in the context of alchemy, represents one&#39;s imagination, moral judgement, and the higher mental faculties. Holmyard also points out that &quot;mercury&quot; does not literally refer to mercury the element. Rather, alchemists are using &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;mercury&quot;, and &quot;sulphur&quot; to refer to the properties of elements which are believed formed from these base properties, called primaries. They also refer to primaries of one&#39;s self that must be kept in balance. Holmyard states, as an example, the belief that too much mercury leds to depression, as this alchemic prime corresponds to one&#39;s own higher thoughts above their base desires.</p>

<p>Returning to Age of Sigmar, we can now understand the nature of the Quicksilver Swords endless spell. They are manifestations of the smith Celemnis&#39; will, her moral judgement against the servants of Chaos who destroyed her people, her <em>mercury</em>. They are composed of quicksilver, which might not be literal mercury, because they are bound to her intent. Finally, the are of course in the shape of swords, because Celemnis wishes to cut down her enemies and because that is where her knowledge, her <em>higher thinking</em>, was spent in life.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Faction Design</h1>

<p>Something I didn&#39;t do for the last post was correlate faction design to the realmsphere. In the case of Ulgu, we have the Daughters of Khaine, whose leader embodies the art of lies and deception. In the case of Chamon, we have the Kharadron Overlords.</p>

<p>At first glance, we can say they embody Chamon, because they use a lot of technology and they&#39;re covered in metal, but once again we need to look deeper. The Kharadron Overlords are defined by their pragmatism, as opposed to the dogmatic ways of their ancestors and the Dispossessed. This was something born out of need to abandon their old ways, their royal dynasties and faith, and indeed they changed their very being because of it. The ever-pragmatic Kharadron are ever as quick to transmute their own words and contracts to their favor as their forefathers transmuted their entire culture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pragmatism also governs the Kharadron’s approach to matters of honour. While they take sworn oaths as seriously as any duardin, the Kharadron are perfectly willing to exploit loopholes and technicalities in loosely worded contracts to maximise their advantage – and material gain – in any situation.</p>

<p>Battletome: Kharadron Overlords (2020) - Masters of the Skies, pg. 4</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The Lore of Metal is exoterically manifested by its base ability to transmute and decompose metals, but esoterically represents the transmutation, composition, or decomposition of one&#39;s being. Uncorrupted, it is a force that changes the landscape and people to more perfect and purer forms. Corrupted, it is a force of rusting, violent twisted metal, an imbalance of nature and soul. Its manifestations reflect both the exoteric and esoteric nature alchemy. The case of Quicksilver Swords gives an example of how the power of Chamon can be used to decompose one&#39;s self to manifest one&#39;s own spirit via a conduit of symbolic quicksilver. Within the inhabitants of Chamon, namely the Kharadron Overlords, we see how when needed they can transmute their people into new forms, not physically, but spiritually and culturally. Perhaps one day, GW writers will further delve into the symbolic nature of Chamon, and give us actual interesting spells, but for now we can see that they already touched upon it.</p>

<h2>The Lores of Magic - Part I - Ulgu</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/posixthreads </span><span class = "numcomments">9 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/mvw2zr/the_lores_of_magic_part_i_ulgu/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(620)">View full post</button><div id="620" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Continuing from my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/mtqt31/the_twofold_nature_of_magic_in_age_of_sigmar/">previous post</a>, I wanted to create a series discussing the deeper nature of the lores of magic and the realms themselves. Being someone overly eager to see Malerion&#39;s faction I wish to start with the magics of Ulgu, Grey Magic, and the Lore of Shadows.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>The Lore of Shadows</h1>

<p>As mentioned in my previous post, magic in Age of Sigmar operates on a perceptual and conceptual level. For Ulgu, we start with description of Grey Magic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Grey Magic</strong></p>

<p>The secrets of the magic of Ulgu are legion, for it is smoke, and subtlety, and lies. It is the art of illusion, of elusive possibilities, hidden within obscuring mists and hazy intentions. It is the magic of charlatans, with misdirection and shadow wrapped about its daring trickster heart. It can also bring hidden justice to those who have escaped retribution.</p>

<p><em>Age of Sigmar Roleplay: Soulbound</em> - Corebook, pg. 261</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description above gives a nice overview, but the truth is that it barely scratches the surface. On the perceptual level, the Ulgu is the power of shadows and darkness. It encompasses spells that can strike fear, cast illusions, and toy with the minds of others. It can summon the power of shadows to open pathways to hidden places, there even exists a form of trans-realm travel known as <em>shadowpaths</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conceptual Understanding</h1>

<p>There is a common theme to the Lore of Shadows from which we can better understand it at a conceptual level. Ulgu represents the the hidden things of the cosmos arcane, not just places but within people as well. When Hysh casts its light upon the cosmos, it is the shadows and the things within them that remain hidden. This is why it being called the <em>Lore of Shadows</em> rather than the <em>Lore of Darkness</em> is so fundamentally correct. Darkness is known, but shadows are hidden.</p>

<p>Understanding this concept lets us better understand why Grey Magic is the way it is. Shadows represent the things we hide: our fears, our thoughts, our memories, our dreams, which are often hidden from ourselves as well. The shadows are the places we dare not enter, for we can always remain safe within the warm light. The shadows are where one schemes, where they look upon another with spite or hidden desire. The shadows are where one finds peace, whether beneath the cool shade, the breeze of a cloudy day or the warmth within their deepest dreams. It is within the shadows we physically hide ourselves, whether for refuge or simply for a moment&#39;s quiet.</p>

<p>This is exemplified by the very nature of the realm of Ulgu:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the domain of secrets and lies, of twisted reason and mindbending illusion, and it conforms not to the laws of logic. Ulgu can swallow an invading army just as morning mist obscures the dawn, and leave nothing behind but their screams. Not even those who have lived there since birth dare to trust their senses for long.</p>

<p>All the shrouded countries of Ulgu are saturated with illusion and lurking menace. It was not always this way – once, many of Ulgu’s Thirteen Dominions were synonymous with refuge, philosophical introspection and the bliss of lucid dreams.</p>

<p><em>Age of Sigmar - Core Rulebook 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition</em>, pg. 108</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h1>Spells</h1>

<p>As one would expect, the <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Lore_of_Shadows">spells of the Lore of Shadows</a> match the overall concept of Ulgu. They are largely combinations of illusory spells, mind control spells, and spells to summon hidden pathways and creatures, with some spells in between.</p>

<p>Amongst the summoning spells, grey magic can summon a phantasmal guardian for protection, aetheric tendrils to grab an enemy, hungry creatures of shadows, or helpful shadowy steed. We can open hidden pathways called &quot;shadowpaths&quot; to dart across a battlefield or switch places with another.</p>

<p>A majority of known spells with the Lore of Shadows involves manipulating antother&#39;s mind in a harmful way. This includes shrouding them in despair, enslaving their minds (prominently used by Darkling Sorceresses), instilling fear and terror into the heart of an enemy, or just generally inflicting great sorrow.</p>

<p>With regards to the spell lores, we only know of two other related spell lores: the Lore of Dark Sorcery (Anvilard) and the Lore of Umbral Spite (Har Kuron). The former spell lore is a subset of the latter. and both are mostly just known spells within the Lore of Shadows. Perhaps when Maleion&#39;s faction is released, we will be able see more facets of the magic o Ulgu.</p>

<p>However, the one shadow-based endless spell allows us to further confirm the nature of Ulgu, the <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Umbral_Spellportal">Umbral Spellportal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Umbral Spellportal</strong></p>

<p>Those who look with an untrained eye upon an Umbral Spellportal see little more than a swirl of murky shadow. Some may perceive vague shapes in the undulating ripples across its surface, and in these forms they may see hints of <strong>secrets long kept or memories thought to be forgotten</strong>. But those able to peer through the veil of magic see a shadowy reflection of what lies on the other side of the portal.</p>

<p><em>Malign Sorcery</em>, pg. 27</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also of interest is the story of a Hysh scholar who passed through a spellportal to better understand what lies beyond it. Though she strongly denied anything lies between the two ends of a spellportal, she became hysteric and claimed that her place of study had suddenly taken on more dimensions.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>To summarize, the Lore of Shadows is only perceptually related to the power of darkness, but like any other spell lore it represents a deep metaphysical concept related to hidden things. This is reflected in both the nature of the realm of Ulgu and the spells within the Lore of Shadows, as well as the one endless spell related to Ulgu. While much Ulgu&#39;s tabletop and lore representation is with the Daughters of Khaine and Dark Aelf mini factions (Darkling Covens, Order Serpentis, Scourge Privateers, and Shadowblades), we can expect that the full umbral might of Ulgu will be unleashed with a future Malerion expansion.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(621)">View full post</button><div id="621" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the most interesting an unique aspects of the fantasy Warhammer settings compared to other settings is the nature of magic. Where as other fantasy setting will divide &quot;schools&quot; of magic into the methods and general effects, Warhammer instead divides magic and indeed the realms into winds and realms which manifest in perceptual and conceptual ways. For this post, I wanted to give some background on the real-world origins of the eight winds of magic, before delving into their meanings, and finally comparing it with what we see in other tabletop fantasy games.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>Liber Kaos and the Eight Magics</h1>

<p>In 1960s England, a little over a decade before GW was founded, a new occult movement was formed based on the notion of &quot;Chaos Magick&quot;. The general idea is that magic is derived from one&#39;s own belief in it, a concept no doubt familiar to Warhammer readers of any setting. Rather than accepting the absolute truth of certain rituals or traditions of other occult practices (e.g. Wicca), the methods and symbols of magical rituals only serve to enforce one&#39;s own belief in its power, and by extension empower the practitioner. The term &quot;Chaos&quot; refers to the origin and continued practice of magick and events. The comparison can be made with the Warhammer setting, where the eight winds of magic originally blew from the realm of Chaos, before being unbound during the End Times.</p>

<p>Continuing on, the eight lores of magic bear a resemblance to the &quot;Eight Magicks&quot; described by occultist Peter J. Caroll in his book Liber Kaos, which some of you may notice sounds like the Warhammer lore book called Liber Chaotica. In Liber Kaos, Caroll divides magic into eight colours:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Red - War Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Orange - Thinking Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Purple/Silver - Sex Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Yellow - Ego Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Green - Love Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Blue - Wealth Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Black - Death Magic</p></li>
<li><p>Octarine - Pure Magic</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting, that <em>Liber Kaos</em> came out in 1992, but Carroll&#39;s seminal work <em>Liber Null</em>, which described much of the same ideas came much earlier. Within his books, he draws these magics as arrows which together form the eight-pointed Star of Chaos that we all know and love. While I won&#39;t get into the details of every one of these magics, it should be understood each of these magics are described as possessing various &quot;aspects&quot;. For example, red/war magics contains two aspects. One is the invocation of vitality, aggression, and morale. The second is the conduct of actual war magic, as in pulling up weapons, marking weaponry with sigils and so on. Obviously, this doesn&#39;t sound like magic at all, and just sounds like someone getting angry before bashing someone else over the head, but that&#39;s not really what I want to discuss.</p>

<p>The main point is how the Warhammer setting was clearly derived inspiration from the work of British occultists and implemented the following ideas into the setting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Magic is to be divided along eight lines, originating from primordial Chaos (the latter detailed changed during the End Times)</p></li>
<li><p>Magic is colour-coded, with the color most matching of its overall description. The actually color-coding has changed from Fantasy to Age of Sigmar a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Magic is to operate on both a perceptual and conceptual level</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>The Eight Magics of Warhammer</h1>

<p>Now onto the main topic, the eight winds, realms, and lores of Warhammer, summarized below:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Wind/Realm</th>
<th>Lore</th>
<th>Fantasy Colour</th>
<th>AoS Colour</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Azyr</td>
<td>Heavens</td>
<td>Blue</td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I personally wish to start a series exploring each of these magics in detail, but here I&#39;ll provide general examples of the how the two-fold nature of magic in Age of Sigmar manifests in the form of spells representing each wind/realm&#39;s perceptual and conceptual aspects.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example for the Aqshy, the lore and realm of fire:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bright Magic</strong></p>

<p>Fire is the heart of the magic of Aqshy. It is raging passions that burn the spirit and blazing flames that incinerate flesh. It is the heat haze of the deep desert, the gasp following the first breathless kiss, and the rage after a bitter defeat.</p>

<p>Soulbound: Corebook, pg. 261</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the above excerpt, we see described the perceptual and conceptual nature of Aqshy, which is quite similar to the Red Magic described by Peter J. Caroll in Liber Kaos, On the perceptual level, we obviously get fire spells such Fireball and Inferno Blades, but the magic of Aqshy also works on a conceptual level. You get spells such as Wrath that enflame one&#39;s own rage, or Hearthfire to grant warm reassurance to one&#39;s allies. Within the realm of Aqshy, we see references to random instances of mass rage induced the nature of the realm (see Gloomspite novel)</p>

<p>Truthfully, the concepts behind Aqshy are one of the least explored in Warhammer. There is so much focus on the literally fiery nature of it that little attention has been given to its emotional characteristics. However, endless spells are a good way to better understand concepts as well. Let&#39;s take the <a href="https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Burning_Head">Burning Head</a> endless spell as an example. Yes, it&#39;s a head made of fire, but there&#39;s more too it than that. It&#39;s a raging head of fire. It&#39;s an inferno that can&#39;t be controlled and those who don&#39;t flee and aren&#39;t incinerated as it passes by may feel a sudden fury and passion filling their veins.</p>

<p>For the other lores of magic, there is simply too much to describe in one post, so I&#39;ll be doing a series later. I could go on to describe how Shyish describes more than death, but also endings, and madness; how Azyr represents the heavens and storms, but also prophecy and time; how Ulgu represents shadows and darkness, but also the things we hide such as our fears, memories, thoughts, and dreams. With this post, I want to grant a general overview of what makes magic in Age of Sigmar so special.</p>

<h1>Comparison with Other Fantasy Settings</h1>

<p>There is actually at least one other popular tabletop game where the setting and magic is divided along the perceptual and conceptual lines we see in chaos magic: Magic: The Gathering. I was planning on writing more on this topic, but <a href="https://deathbymage.com/2018/08/28/mage-of-the-gathering-mana-and-magic-in-ravnica/">an article</a> by Jacky Leung on Death by Mage actually gives a good example on how colour-coded concepts can map to D&amp;D-style school of magic that you would see, for example, in the Elder Scrolls games and D&amp;D 5e of course.</p>

<p>As shown in the article, there can&#39;t be a one-to-one mapping between &quot;schools of magic&quot; and winds of magic. Every wind and lore of magic is related to one spell or another which can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Summon elemental creatures</p></li>
<li><p>Heal wounds</p></li>
<li><p>Summon powerful energies to attack</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some D&amp;D schools of magic may fall entirely under one lore of magic:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>D&amp;D School</th>
<th>AoS Lore</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Abjuration</td>
<td>Mixed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Conjuration</td>
<td>Mixed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Divination</td>
<td>Azyr</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enchantment</td>
<td>Ulgu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evocation</td>
<td>Mixed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Illusion</td>
<td>Ulgu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Necromancy</td>
<td>Shyish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transmutation</td>
<td>Mixed</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, it&#39;s not a 1-to-1 match, so if you&#39;re adapting Warhammer spells for D&amp;D, some thought needs to be given to the nature of the realms, winds, and lores of magic.</p>

<h1>Extras</h1>

<p><strong>On Ice Magic</strong>: It has been asked before why there is no Realm of Ice or Lore of Ice as Kislev had. Age of Sigmar actually has a wind of magic called Izotz with a set of icy spells similar the Lore of Ice Kislev possessed.</p>
