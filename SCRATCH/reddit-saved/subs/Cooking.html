<p>I thought this sub may enjoy this show.  It&#39;s filmed in my hometown and highlights southern cooking traditions along with running the house at a farm to table restaurant and oyster bar. It won a Peabody award earlier this year and was nominated for a James Beard award. </p>

<p>I split it into <strong>basics and advanced</strong>.</p>

<p>For me the absolute basics are:</p>

<ul>
<li>veggies like tomatoes, bell peppers and frozen broccoli</li>
<li>sweet potatoes and rice</li>
<li>quark, which translates to curd (/ curd cheese?), it&#39;s like a mix between cottage cheese and yoghurt</li>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>frozen berries</li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced stuff includes</p>

<ul>
<li>nut butter or nuts</li>
<li>cocoa nibs</li>
<li>coconut flakes</li>
</ul>

<p>and other stuff depending on my likes for that week.</p>

<h2>Feeding Hannibal, a blog by Janice Poon, the food stylist for TV's Hannibal - a fascinating and unique read!</h2>

<div id="3ccfdp" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those of you who watch <em>Hannibal</em>, you know half of the show&#39;s appeal is the drop-dead gorgeous (ha!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgkVzYe7p_A">dishes</a> the titular character makes using his victim&#39;s flesh. Today I found <a href="http://janicepoonart.blogspot.com/">Feeding Hannibal</a>, a blog by Janice Poon, who is the food stylist for the show. The blog is relatively low-tech but the content is absolutely amazing! It features how she designs, sculpts, and prepares all the edible dishes in the show. She also adds little tidbits about the actors and how each scene is filmed. Really interesting and inspiring.</p>

<p>For example, here&#39;s her initial <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F-FkJ98RFo8/U27-qnYd6XI/AAAAAAAAAtg/jgB4t9S33rY/s1600/211_sketch_ortolan+650.jpg">design sketch</a> for a scene involving flambeed ortolons (a songbird delicacy that is fattened, drowned in Armagnac, and eaten whole under a napkin so god doesn&#39;t see your sinful indulgence--the experience contains the crunch of delicate bones, a fatty foie gras-like liver, and a burst of Armagnac from the lungs). Since ortolans are illegal/endangered, she sculpts them out of <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2L_yN0eafsM/U27-nJ31cQI/AAAAAAAAAsw/znRfdwIAbNQ/s1600/211_closeup+ortolan650.jpg">marzipan</a>. How gorgeous is <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SqEiyFpxyis/U27-ounMSuI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/w-ANMo3vAFQ/s1600/211_ortolan+tray650.jpg">this shot</a>! </p>

<p>In another scene Hannibal is seen <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ROjCDob.gif">cracking an egg</a> on the edge of a spatula. Body doubles were sourced from various Benihanas to perform the trick, but Janice reveals that this isn&#39;t necessary. Mads Mikkelsen was able to perform his own stunt--he was a juggler in his youth. </p>

<h2>Buffalo Chicken Potstickers</h2>

<li>Photo : <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gPicg">http://imgur.com/a/gPicg</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here’s what you will need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Rotisserie Chicken /shredded (about 3 cups worth)</li>
<li>1/2 cup Celery /finely chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup Carrots /finely chopped</li>
<li>4 ounces Cream Cheese /softened</li>
<li>1/2 cup Hot Buffalo Sauce</li>
<li>1/3 cup water
Round wonton/gyoza wrappers
Ranch or Blue Cheese Dressing for dipping (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong>
In a large bowl mix together shredded chicken, celery, carrots, cream cheese, and hot sauce.</p>

<p>To form the potstickers scoop about a teaspoon amount into the center of a wrapper. Wet your finger and brush the top edge of the wrapper with water. Fold the wrapper in half and press and crimp the edges to close.</p>

<p>Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Place the potstickers seam side up into the hot oil and leave to brown (once placed DO NOT MOVE - you want a nice golden brown on the bottom, right?).</p>

<p>After about two minutes, or until desired color is reached, add 1/3 cup water and cover the saucepan. Leave to steam about two more minutes - or until the water has mostly evaporated and the potstickers have steamed. Uncover, remove from pan and serve with your choice of ranch or blue cheese dipping sauce. Enjoy!</p>

<p>After watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dGBRGtyzX0">video</a> of Traci Des Jardins and Adam Savage make an omelette, using the french method with a whole bunch of butter, and folding it over (rather than flipping before folding) and serving when it&#39;s slightly undercooked, letting the residual heat finish the job - I completely changed my omelette style. Using this method, my eggs are much fluffier, and have just the perfect taste and texture with all that butter emulsified in them. No ketchup required. They aren&#39;t runny, but they&#39;re just barely cooked and very delicate, and that makes a huge difference.</p>

(I use a cup of flour, a couple TBS olive oil, a tsp salt, 1 egg and I fill one half an egg shell twice to measure milk) Roll out to like 1/4-1/8&quot; thick and cut into thick tagliatelle strips. It&#39;s amazing with a smokey gorgonzola cheese/garlic/white wine sauce. The bitter chocolate brings out the sharp taste of the cheese. To compliment, I cover a strip steak in gorgonzola and wrap a slice of thick bacon or two around it before grilling medium rare on a hot grill.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the weather has been turning a bit colder, I have been scouring the web for chili recipes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chilicookoff.com/Winner/Winner_Champions.asp?Cat=1">Here is the list</a></p>

<p>As an example here is the 2014 winning recipe by Mike Stevens:</p>

<p><strong>YAKETY YAK RANCH CHILI</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 lbs cubed beef trip-tip</p></li>
<li><p>2 14 oz cans beef broth</p></li>
<li><p>1 8 oz can of tomato sauce</p></li>
<li><p>4 cloves of garlic - pressed</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp Tabasco</p></li>
<li><p>1 jalapeno pepper - pierced</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1st Spices</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 tbsp onion powder</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tsp Mexican ground oregano</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 tsp ground Bay Leaf powder</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp Hernandez Farm medium New Mexico chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp paprika</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp Penderys Fort Worth light chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tbsp New Mexico hot chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tbsp Mild Bill&#39;s Cadillac Cowgirl chili blend</p></li>
<li><p>2 tsp chicken granules</p></li>
<li><p>2 tsp beef granules</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp gound cumin</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2nd Spices</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 tbsp ground cumin</p></li>
<li><p>2 packets Sazon Goya seasoning</p></li>
<li><p>1/4tsp brown sugar</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 tsp white pepper</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp Hernandez Farm medium New Mexico chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp paprika</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tbsp Penderys Fort Worth light chili powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tbsp Mild Bill&#39;s Cadillac Cowgirl chili blend</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> </p>

<p>Brown meat, drain and rinse and then add 2 cans of beef broth, can of tomato sauce, 1 tbsp Tabasco, pressed garlic and 1st Spice Mix. Pierce a jalapeno pepper and float in sauce. Simmer for 2-2 1/2 hours and then remove the softened jalapeno, squeezing it into the sauce to give it a little more heat. Add the 2nd Spice Mix and simmer for another 1/2 hour and then serve up. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent dozens of hours on ridiculously complex dishes only for them to end up half-eaten - the two most mind-numbingly simple recipes I&#39;ve ever made have been some of the biggest hits: oreo &quot;truffles&quot; and goat cheese stuffed peppadew peppers.  You could probably adapt the peppadew recipe to macaroni and cheese - matter of fact, that&#39;d be freaking delicious.</p>

<p><strong>Oreo &quot;Truffles&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>

<p>16oz package of Oreos</p>

<p>8oz cream cheese, room temperature</p>

<p>8oz bittersweet baking chocolate</p>

<p>4oz white chocolate (optional)</p>

<p><em>Method</em></p>

<p>Grind oreos into a sand-like texture in a food processor.  Combine with cream cheese in a large bowl until a dark paste is formed.</p>

<p>Melt bittersweet chocolate in a double-boiler.  Roll paste into 1/2&quot; balls, dip in chocolate, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate before serving - drizzle with white chocolate if you wanna go hogwild with it.</p>

<p><strong>Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppadew Peppers</strong></p>

<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>

<p>16oz peppadew peppers, rinsed and dried</p>

<p>4oz goat cheese</p>

<p>Balsamic cream (or balsamic vinegar reduced to a syrupy consistency)</p>

<p>Julienned basil (optional)</p>

<p><em>Method</em></p>

<p>Stuff peppers with goat cheese.  Drizzle with balsamic cream.  That&#39;s it.  Sprinkle some basil on there if you wanna be all high-society about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans all come from somewhere. Their families may have roamed the continent for thousands of years before the Mayflower dropped anchor. They may have been on the ship. They may have come on later ones, freely or in chains. They may have come by truck, train or airplane. They came. And their journeys are reflected in the food they or their descendants eat. The Times asked 15 families from across the country to show us the holiday dishes they make that speak most eloquently about their heritage and traditions. The stories of these home cooks help tell the story of the nation, the story of who we are. — SAM SIFTON</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do a brussels sprouts salad that never lasts, but doesn&#39;t sound too exciting when you say &quot;I&#39;ll bring a brussels sprouts salad&quot;.</p>

<p>Thinly shaved brussels sprouts, thinly sliced red onions soaked in water and a little vinegar (drain before using!), crispy bacon, blue cheese or any chunky/creamy equivalent. The dressing is bacon fat, olive oil, dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, and some finely chopped fresh herbs. Toss everything in the morning and give the vinegar a little time to soften up the sprouts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really fresh with big flavors and a good way to sneak something a little less artery clogging into what&#39;s usually a pigout fest.</p>

<p>We usually potluck from morning &#39;til noon so breakfast is an option.   I&#39;d love to hear your ideas/past dishes of something that just unexpectedly &quot;wowed&quot; your co workers (and you) and was a bit more refreshing than crock pot meatballs =)</p>

<p>In order to make my stand mixer earn it&#39;s keep I churn a quart of heavy cream into butter every 2-3 weeks. The machine does most of the work. The recipe with a machine is foolproof. The hardest part is clean up.</p>

<p>For those of you who make butter too, what have you learned and what makes the difference between a good butter and a great butter?</p>

<p>I source my heavy cream from the market, generally whatever is on sale, which has yielded both store brand and name brand with no discernible difference.</p>

<p>Ultimately I&#39;d like to make a butter than rivals the Irish brands, but I&#39;m patient.</p>

<p>EDIT: The recipe for Unsalted Butter.</p>

<p><em>note, I don&#39;t salt my butter until its needed, howevah, some suggest that salting at the beginning makes a difference.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Get your cleanest plumbus and wax it with 1 lb of kreelium.</li>
<li>Ok, for real. 1 qt. heavy cream. Place glass of water with ice in the freezer.</li>
<li>Set up your stand mixer with a paddle attachment, add the heavy cream, drape a towel over the mixer.</li>
<li>Gradually increase the speed until the liquid is mixing but not not splashing.</li>
<li>Do other stuff, the churning will take a few minutes.</li>
<li>When the sound goes from thick mixing to high pitched splashing turn off the machine.</li>
<li>The cream has separated into butter and butter milk.</li>
<li>Gently squeeze the butter solids to release the butter milk.</li>
<li>Reserve the butter milk, go make biscuits, pancakes, or something.</li>
<li>Pour your ice water (not the ice) into the mixing bowl with the butter solids.</li>
<li>Set machine speed to 1. The ice water will further solidify the butter while releasing more liquid.</li>
<li>Squeeze the butter solids, discard the liquid, and place the butter in a container in your fridge to set. </li>
</ol>

<p>Edit 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHl_pHjT3dU">Very relevant.</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: Cultured Butter, FTW. Looks like there is a whole new world to be had in the homemade universe of butter. And raw milk from grass-fed Jersey cows is apparently the way to get there because of the high fat content. There are a few videos in the comments. </p>

<p>Edit 3: Anyone want to go in on this butter that&#39;s $50/lb. <a href="http://www.saveur.com/worlds-best-fancy-butter">http://www.saveur.com/worlds-best-fancy-butter</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>My grandma used to make a pretty simple dish that my parents relied on when they were struggling, and made for me that I adore! It’s just a roux (flour butter milk) and a tin of tuna, all mixed together and seasoned with a bit of salt and a LOT of pepper. served with plain white rice. You can jazz it up with a bit of cream in the sauce as well.... sooooo good and so filling!</p>

<h2>What items are worth buying from a restaurant supply store?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(421)">View full post</button><div id="421" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Worth noting that not everything sold at a restaurant supply store is actually commercial grade. Take a look for the NSF stamp. If it has one of those, it’s actually commercial grade equipment. Should be a more quality product and be easier to clean as it was built to meet cleanability standards for the food industry.</p>

<p>Round round end spatulas from an asian market - about $5 each.  Asian Wok ladles are about the same, but built on a better angle than the European 90 degree deep dives The ladles are great for cut veggie portioning as well as regular ladle and stirring duties.</p>

<p>Chinese vegetable knife -- looks like a cleaver but runs thinner and is usually high carbon steel to offer razor edge cutting.. Can cut chicken bones if you do not mind sharpening it after a while, but when properly sharp can cut tomato slices thin, thin, thin.  For regular cutting it has the height of metal so you can easily keep your claw grip on a potato or carrot with the knuckles agains the blade, fingers curled in and make very regular slices without a mandolin or special tool. Those with a slight curve also can thin sliver cut meats for Asia dishes.</p>

<p>Fine mesh Chinese stainless steel skimmer/strainer, various widths and built on a similar angle as the ladle.  Beats a slotted spoon for many things and beats fat skimming with a spoon</p>

<p>From the Restaurant supply store:</p>

<p>I have my long knives I got some 40 years ago.  I know they are still available. Forgot the brand, but they are stainless BUT high carbon.  Less than $40 each, plus an edge sheath if you keep your knives in a drawer. These are all knives with 10 inch or more blades and are in two shapes.</p>

<p>Good meat hammer, and a meat tenderizing spiker/perforator.</p>

<p>Surface scrapers (2 stainless steel) for taking thins into a pile and off your cutting board after slicing/chopping.</p>

<p>Plus, be warned, it is expensive, but worthwhile to spend some time browsing the shelves and bins for items you know you will need that will last for years -- and are more tool than consumer gimmick &quot;As Seen On TV.&quot;</p>
