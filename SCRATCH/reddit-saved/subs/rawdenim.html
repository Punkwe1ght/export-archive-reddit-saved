<p>I just wanted to put together a little write-up  for individuals with large thighs (I didn&#39;t want to call this a guide). This is going to largely focus on what people have been calling “lifters cuts”. I would say that the common theme among these fits is that they all have a bit of a taper to the leg, and a larger thigh and rise than what you often see. I probably left out a number of straight leg fits that have the larger thigh and rise, but since I often see questions for the comfortable top block and taper, I figured I would focus on that.</p>

<p>The list is a little biased in that I left out a few fits (like the 3sixteen BSP) since they don’t meet my subjective standard of ‘larger thighs’. For reference, looking at a 34” waist, I wanted to include thighs &gt;12.25” and rises &gt;11”, with a leg opening &lt;8.25”. I also left out some Iron Heart and Flat Head fits that may fit this criteria as I don’t have the knowledge to compare their unsanforized measurements to the sanforized fabrics. So this list only focuses on fits with sanforized fabrics.</p>

<p>I’m particularly passionate about these type of fits since they’re really the only ones I can fit in. I’m actually quite jealous of a lot of people here who have more fabric options available to them since my thighs are too large for most of the popular ones here. The vast majority of these fits seem to have been released in the past year which has me very excited. It seems like every month a new company is announced a fit like this.</p>

<p><strong>Japan Blue High Tapered</strong></p>

<p>This fit only came out this past summer. After only being out for a couple months, they’ve already got 3 different fabrics in stock at Blue Owl. The leg has a more extreme taper than others on this list, but along with it somes a smaller thigh and rise.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Momotaro Natural Tapered</strong></p>

<p>I believe this fit came out about a year ago. Momotaro seems to have expanded this fit into several different fabrics including the new BOM00X. I think Blue Owl is the only retailer that carries this fit.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Rogue Territory Strider</strong></p>

<p>This fit just came out this past spring. They currently have just two fabrics available. One being the hemp/cotton, which is only available in the Strider fit. I’m hoping that they’ll release their Dark (indigo/indigo) fabric in this fit soon, but I haven’t heard any news.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Left Field Charles Atlas</strong></p>

<p>These came out a few months back and are clearly marketed to lifters (hence the name). These have a very generous back rise and large thigh and a fairly aggressive taper. They have stated this will come eventually in the Black Maria fabric. I have my fingers crossed that they’ll release some more interesting fabrics in these as I’m a big LF fan, and I’m outgrowing my Greasers and Chelseas. </p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Left Field Greaser</strong></p>

<p>The Greaser has been one of Left Fields standard fits for a while and the 13oz Cone Greaser was my first raw denim purchase. The fit has a bit of taper to it, but can look like a straight leg on some. They carry a variety of American, Japanese, and Italian fabrics in the Greaser fit.</p>

<p><strong>3sixteen CT</strong></p>

<p>This is a new fit that came out a few months back which is supposed to have the top block of the CS fit, and the tapered leg of the ST fit. Unfortunately the thigh is only about 0.25-0.5”” larger than the ST fit and a slightly higher rise. These probably have the smallest thigh on the list and I considered not including them. I was disappointed to learn the measurements wouldn’t work for me since I am always amazed at how well their jeans fade and wanted to try them, particularly the 120x.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Taylor Stitch Democratic</strong></p>

<p>Taylor Stitch doesn’t get a lot of attention around here. These would be the budget option for this fit, coming in as low as $145 (and they do offer discounts to first customers). It also looks like they have a bit of a lower rise than some of the other fits on here.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Somet Writers Pants</strong></p>

<p>This fit probably has the most extreme leg taper of the bunch with the 34” waist going all the way down to a less than 7” leg opening. I would be quite interested in seeing someone wear this as the large thigh and tiny leg opening seem like they would look awkward on people that didn’t have the right proportions.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Imperial Shearer</strong></p>

<p>This fit looks to have the highest rise on the list (&gt;13” for 34” waist). </p>

<p><strong>N&amp;F Easy Guy</strong></p>

<p>These just got announced a few days ago and are only available at Barneys until December/January. I haven’t seen any measurements for these yet, but felt they were worth including in the list.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I hope that people find this useful. If ya&#39;ll know of other options, or want to toss in your two cents on unsanforized options, I think that would be great.</p>
