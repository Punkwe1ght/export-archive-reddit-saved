<p>I used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uXIPhxL5XA">Christmas Beef Wellington</a> recipe from Gordon Ramsay minus the chestnuts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-beef-wellington-ultimate.html">here</a> that I should bake a wellington at 425 for 30 to 40 minutes, and that to achieve a rare to medium rare roast I should shoot for 110 to 120 degrees internal temperature.</p>

<p>In the video he says only 200 degrees is necessary for about 30 minutes, though that roast looks a bit smaller than the one I have. </p>

<p>Can you guys offer me any advice? I&#39;m very apprehensive about putting this thing in the oven. </p>

<p>Anyway, on with the question.</p>

<p>Is it okay to ship cakes in a jar WITH the icing in it? (It will be sealed of course.) </p>

<p>I usually just see people shipping sealed cakes + icing on the side. But it looks like they usually send a whole cakes worth of jars. I just want to send a few jars of different kinds of cake.</p>

<p>I want to send some cake in a jar to my SO who&#39;s on the other side of the country 2k+ miles away. (If I ship with flat rate it SHOULD get there in 2 days.) </p>

<p>Would it be okay to layer it cake&gt;icing&gt;cake&gt;icing, seal the jars and ship without it going bad? I know I shipped something once flat rate/2 day and it took a week to get there, so I want to know if even if the shipping is delayed or sits somewhere for a few days, would it be okay?</p>

<p>:P I don&#39;t want my SO to get sick from eating bad cake.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: shipping cake+icing in sealed jars. Would it be safe to eat after a few days?</strong></p>

<h2>Hi, my girlfriend works at a lab and she doesnt know in advance if she has to stay late. Is there any dish that I can make for her that lasts 5-7 days in a fridge without going bad?</h2>

<div class="md"><p>Stewthulhu&#39;s Lab Food Grab Bag:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Something high-calorie and nonperishable (like trail mix) to hide in some place where EH&amp;S can&#39;t find it. Sometimes you don&#39;t have time for a full meal if you&#39;re in the middle of something, but you&#39;ve gotta eat. NOTE: Does not apply if you work with things that are actually harmful to ingest.</p></li>
<li><p>Perishable snacks you can keep in your lunch box. Always bring one more than you plan to eat that day. I like fruit, but there are plenty of viable options. Basically something to eat if you run out of food and still have to work. If you&#39;re done on time, just have it as a snack the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergency dinner. Cycle it out every week on some day that&#39;s convenient. If you have to feed cells or take care of mice or something every Sunday, make that your replacement day. But basically keep something in the back of the fridge just in case. If you have to eat it, replace it the next day. If you have the rare week in which you don&#39;t work late, have it as a lunch or something at the end of the week. My standards are stew with rice, stew with potatoes, Thai curry with rice, pasta with meat sauce, and barbeque with a baked potato.</p></li>
<li><p>Lunch. Make it filling. Chicken breast and brown rice will not carry you through a 6 hour experiment you can&#39;t start until 1:30. Beef, pork, dark meat chicken, some sort of low glycemic-index carb, and some fatty component, whether avocado or cooking oil or whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergency beer. This, of course, depends on the lab culture. But if a 12-day experiment fails at 10 PM on a Sunday, it&#39;s better to mutter to yourself for 30 minutes with a beer in hand than to catastrophize as you&#39;re trying to drive home and then yelling at your partner because you&#39;re stressed.</p></li>

<div id="d3z2yl0" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>All-Clad is almost top of pack when it comes to cookware quality but not the king in terms of highest performance. They&#39;re the most well-known of the premium cookware.</p>

<p>Right above All-Clad you have Demeyere, a Belgium cookware maker. Pound for pound Demeyere&#39;s Industry 5 line of products will outperform the All-Clad&#39;s stainless product (but not against All-Clad&#39;s MC2 line). Demeyere&#39;s cookware has no unwieldy rivets to clean around, more aluminum in the cladding for more even heat transfer, and electroplated for basic non-stick qualities. Then right above Demeyere Industry 5 is their Atlantis and Proline series, arguably the best stainless steel cookware out there. You&#39;ll also be paying $310 for a single 12.5&quot; fry pan... You can read up on Demeyere&#39;s products vs All-Clad on <a href="https://www.centurylife.org/cookware-even-heating-rankings-butane-propane-natural-gas-etc/">centurylife.org</a>. Best quality dutch ovens are from Le Creuset and Staub, they&#39;re about the same quality and will last a lifetime (same as Demeyere or All-Clad). Lastly avoid spending too much on non-stick pans, a basic Anolon Nouvelle Copper pan will do a great job.</p>

<p>If you have money to burn, get Demeyere products over All-Clad but prepare to spend a few hundred dollars for a basic set. If you have less money get Tramontina Triclad or Cusininart Multiclad line of pans, they perform about good as All-Clad.</p>

<p>Best online resource I found for cookware and utensils is <a href="http://www.cutleryandmore.com">Cutlery and More</a>. They consistently carry the highest quality brands/products at lower prices than Sur La Table and William Sonoma.</p>

<p>You mentioned that you&#39;re looking to put together a set with individual pieces. Here&#39;s how I approached building my cookware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demeyere Proline 12.5&quot; fry pan (highest quality fry pan in the world, bar none. Searing steaks, stir-fry, frying stuff up)</li>
<li>Demeyere 5-plus 3.5qt conical saute pan (used for saute-ing, reductions, sauces, everything)</li>
<li>Le Creuset 7.25 dutch oven (go to for soups, braises, chili, one pot meals, etc.)</li>
<li>Cuisinart Professional Series 6 qt saute pan (performs as good as the Atlantis pan but at 1/5 of the price and slightly bigger.)</li>
<li>Basic 16&quot; carbon wok (stir-fry large meals, fried rice, any large batch of chinese food)</li>
<li>Lodge 12&quot; cast iron (mostly for fun, steaks, bacon, frying up chicken...the Proline 12.5&quot; basically replaces the need for a cast iron)</li>
<li>Ikea non-stick 11&quot; pan (purely for eggs and pancakes, never turn past medium heat, will replace with Anolon Nouvelle Copper Skillets)</li>
<li>Basic 1 qt and 2 qt sauce pans mostly used for boiling water (not for cooking sauces)</li>
<li>No-name big ass 10 qt stock pot</li>
</ul>

<p>Last Edit: If you have a non-induction stovetop, I&#39;d recommend just getting the All-Clad MC2 pans and be done with it. They are relatively cheap compared to the rest of the All Clad products and perform far better than their stainless product line. Only downside is they gets ugly, fast, and will won&#39;t work on an induction cooktop.</p>

<p>Tomorrow: cook polenta in slow cooker (finished with cream and cheese but still somewhat thick. The ultimate goal is to have a bite of polenta hat is a little crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle)</p>

<p>Spread into sheet pan lined with parchment 1&quot; thick). Let cool, wrap in plastic, fridge.</p>

<p>Next day: cut sheet pan of polenta into 6-8 large squares. Sprinkle top liberally with parm and sear eah square cheese side down until the cheese side crisps but polenta still isn&#39;t heated at the way through (I don&#39;t want the squares to fall apart). </p>

<p>Move back to fridge, wrapped, to chill again.</p>

<p>Day 3: slice the cheesy polenta squares into bite size pieces. Move to parchment lined cheer pans, and then right before the party, broil until warm all the way through.</p>

<h2>I need help with finding a way to get my knives sharpened--the professionals in my area don't cut it</h2>

<div id="dfgos9z" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently started woodworking with hand tools like chisels and planes, which need to be sharpened frequently.  I bought a pair of whetstones (1000-grit and 6000-grit), and learned to sharpen my tools pretty quickly.  I then decided to try sharpening my kitchen knives, and I can now get them razor sharp using the same method.  There are a bunch of videos out there to help, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t39rhQs6Hqc">this one.</a>  </p>

<p>The basic principle is to start with the coarser (~1000) stone and grind the sharp edge of your blade down on one side (at a shallow angle ~15 degrees) until you raise a small burr on the other side; then you swap over and do the same on the second side of the blade; then you quickly remove the burr with a couple of strokes, and move to the finer (~6000) stone to do the same again.  By the time you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;ll have a mirror-finish razor-sharp edge.  The tricky bit is holding the ~15 degree angle consistently and getting an even burr along the whole edge, but both will come quickly with practice.  </p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;re pretty into your knives, so I&#39;d thoroughly recommend the investing the time and money into a couple of whetstones and learning how to use them.  It&#39;s pretty fun, and immensely satisfying.  Also, it sounds like any sharpening you can do to those knives at this stage will be an improvement, so just go for it! </p>

<p>long time lurker, first time poster. </p>

<p>Sorry if the question is silly, I&#39;m not an American, I am European and I live in Australia.</p>

<p>I was in a bqq joint  last night, I counted probably 80 pax in the restaurant, with brisket, pork, chicken, rump steak, etc on the menu, i was wondering how do they prepare the meat? Considering i saw the smoker they had on display and it is indeed huge, how&#39;s the meat prepped, how long does it last? Do they have more smokers or they run it 24/7?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/84oxub/sites_with_serious_eatsfood_lab_style_content/dvrc5in/">I made a comment about 6 months ago</a>. The books that built up my foundation of how to cook and why I do the things that I do (and how to look for and develop your own recipes):</p>

<ul>
<li>The Food Lab by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (fundamentals of exactly what you&#39;re trying to accomplish with each step in a recipe, and why certain techniques are good for certain applications).</li>
<li>The Professional Chef by the CIA (lots of fundamentals, and a good introduction to the vocabulary of a professional kitchen).</li>
<li>Ratio by Michael Ruhlman (fundamentals of understanding how ingredient ratios work).</li>
<li>Flavor Bible by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg (tested combinations of flavors and ingredients for taking your food to the next level).</li>
</ul>

<p>For specific types of food, these are good explanatory cookbooks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tartine Bread by Chad Robertson (science of baking naturally fermented bread or sourdough).</li>
<li>Land of Plenty by Fuschia Dunlop (Chinese food, specifically Sichuan food).</li>
<li>Pok Pok by Andy Ricker (Thai food).</li>
<li>Franklin Barbecue by Aaron Franklin (Texas style barbecue).</li>
<li>Rasika by Ashok Bajaj and Vikram Sunderam (Indian food).</li>
<li>Liquid Intelligence by Dave Arnold (cocktails).</li>
<li>Meathead by Meathead Goldwyn (barbecue and grilling).</li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly encourage you to go to your local library and flip through these titles. Check them out, and think about whether you&#39;re likely to refer back to these materials on a regular basis. If so, buy a copy for yourself.</p>

<h2>What are some uncommon cuts of beef that I'm dumb for ignoring?</h2>

<div class="md"><p>Butcher here, truth be told, loads of ‘em. It’ll depend on the day, and what’s in the case, and I’ll try to be brief but here’s how I do it at the shops I work.
Ask yourself three main questions - how much time do I want to spend on this? How many people am I feeding? How much do I want to spend?</p>

<p>If you want to spend a short amount of time, you’re looking for portions of whole muscles rather than the whole pieces that’s been seamed out, a lot of time these can be finished with the word “steak” and done in a pan or on the grill. Bavette, skirt, tri tip; they’re great enjoy em. Cuts you’re overlooking are probably: Denver, petite shoulder tender. The Denver and petite shoulder come from the chuck (front behind neck), and are more marbled but can also be sinewy as a result of the conjunction of several smaller muscles grouped together. Further to the back of the animal you’ve got the top sirloin for a quick grill that always wins, but it’s leaner so it’s less rich, but with a good, salty sear on it you’d confuse it for a filet at half the price.</p>

<p>When you have a lot to feed and want to really impress, grab a roast, something I doubt you do now. They take time, but they’re worth it. Timing will be dependent on each individual roast so you’ll want an instant read thermometer. Pull from oven 10-12 degrees below desired temperature and let rest. If your butcher is worth a damn they can get their hands on caul fat, as well, which you can use to take an otherwise lean (less flavor) and give it something to baste itself with. I recommend the eye of round. It has a good strip of fat along it that’ll baste itself, but for a real win, get your butcher to tie caul fat around it, preferably with a nice chunk of compound butter, two rosemary sprigs and a clove of garlic in it. Low temp for the first few hours and then crank at the end. Let rest ten minutes longer than you think before slicing, and slice on a surface that can collect blood. For the next week, enjoy the greatest roast beef slices in sandwiches or reheat in a screaming hot pan for prime rib-like steaks.</p>

<p>Sure there’s tongue and it’s great but it’s arduous for a home cook - DM me for suggestions on how to make it amazing but it’s not your typical cooking adventure. I can tell you a lot of ways to use the whole animal but if you’re trying to brand out from the bone-in steak tree, I don’t know if bone marrow (delicious and easy) will even feel like cooking beef to you.</p>

<p>Truth is, though, most of the cow tastes the same. It’s the fat that changes flavor. Aim for fatty pieces for flavor. Short ribs are amazing, but they take time, use that as a proverb. Choose wisely, experiment and report back. Listen to your butcher! Good luck.</p>

A lot of &quot;standard&quot; dimensions in residential kitchens are not just poor ergonomics, they are outright harmful for anybody working in there.</p>

<p>When we remodelled our kitchen, we raised all the counters by two inches and we made them extra deep (between 30&quot; and 36&quot;). We also installed a kitchen sink that is considerably shallower than what conventional wisdom would want you to do. But we made up for it by making is big enough to easily hold half-size sheet pans and still have extra space to go. Also, it&#39;s a workstation sink that can have a cutting board rest on it. So, most of them time when I am at the sink, I actually work at counter height.</p>

<p>These all sound like minor tweaks, but the difference is amazing. I can work in this kitchen for hours and it feels very comfortable; no pains and or strange tension. But if I need to cook somewhere else, I get frustrated within minutes. There really is no excuse for these mistakes, when we have learned so much about ergonomics since WWII when many of these dimensions got standardized.</p>

<h2>A question about Mexican rice I haven't seen addressed yet</h2>

It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not following the recipes correctly. The ones I&#39;ve tried have all been delicious - they&#39;re just not what I&#39;m looking for. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying for and failing to replicate is the particular and uniquely straightforward taste of Mexican rice from a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. The rice they serve there doesn&#39;t even remotely taste tomatoey - hell, the only flavors I can really identify are:</p>

<ul>
<li>salt</li>
<li>MSG</li>
<li>garlic</li>
</ul>

<p>I can detect almost nothing else. The rice is colored orange and based on the texture, it was likely toasted/fried in oil prior to cooking. The rice itself seems to be enriched parboiled long grain. There are no little bits of vegetables or onions in it - it&#39;s just the rice. Maybe Sazón was used, but my rice seems to be missing something when I just make it with Sazón. Any ideas?</p>

I&#39;ve seen a bunch like it, but whenever I try them myself, the broth comes out thin and severely underperforms in flavor. What are the restaurants actually doing? I have no great intuition for cooking and so I feel like the recipes are expecting me to read between the lines in a way that I&#39;m not capable. </p>

<p>What kind of coconut milk do they use?</p>

<p>Do they make it from paste or no? Paste that I can find in a regular Asian market?</p>

<p>How much fish sauce and sugar are they actually putting in?</p>

<p>Which ingredients is it necessary to be fresh?</p>

<p>How do I prepare and cut the chicken? It has a distinct shape chewiness that I don&#39;t usually get from cooking chicken. </p>

<button onclick="toggles(888)">View full post</button><div id="888" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>It’s perpetuated by hothead chefs and the fraternity idea that everyone has to undergo hazing. Fortunately there are significant improvements I’ve seen in the last couple decades since I started cooking professionally. In my own kitchen, we do not allow yelling, swearing, or publicly dressing-down other cooks. If someone makes a mistake you wait until after service and take them aside to talk about it.</p>

<p>It does mean in some ways things are less efficient as prep cooks don’t have that fire under their ass to produce faster or get screamed at. But we more than make up for that in extremely low turnaround. Our cooks start with us and stay with is so we have great institutional knowledge which saves us a ton of effort in hiring and training. End of the day it works better for morale, morality, and the bottom line.</p>

<p>I also think Gordon Ramsay in particular has a lot of blame on his shoulders for this. He saw the ratings that the shouty chef personality got him on TV and just went with it. The result is generations of cooks who think it’s acceptable to behave like an asshole to coworkers, and highly toxic, macho kitchens that make work unfairly difficult, especially for women and minorities.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, I wasn&#39;t clear. I didn&#39;t mean to imply that Ramsay started this. The abusive kitchen has existed for a LONG time (read Orwell&#39;s Down and Out in Paris and London, or Jacques Pepin&#39;s memoirs, E.G.), just that in the age of the celebrity chef, Ramsay became the poster child for the idea that you need to abuse your staff in order to get good results, and consequently, many young cooks these days think it&#39;s OK to behave that way because a guy like Gordon Ramsay has given them his blessing. He didn&#39;t create abusive chef culture, but he has historically gone out of his way to use his incredibly huge influence to perpetuate it, and it makes me sad to think of the number of young cooks who have had to face abusive, toxic work environments due to Ramsay&#39;s wide-reaching influence.</p>
