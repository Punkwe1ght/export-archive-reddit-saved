<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For whatever weapon type you chose, you can make your starting few hours in the game a LOT better, by immediately purchasing a set of 4 upgrades for 1 point a piece on the skill tree. You might not even need to level.</p>

<p>The first two are </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Does more damage after a perfect Ki Pulse&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>for Mid and Low stance on your weapon of choice. This is an okay upgrade. This however unlocks the real goal, which is the </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Allow Ki Pulse while Dodging&quot; upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<p>Buying these unlocked them for all weapons they work with as well. This is so goddamn fundamental to having good, enjoyable gameplay that I cannot fathom why this is locked behind a point system. So much of my first half hour of the game I was griping about being out of Ki because I opted to dodge and not get murdered, and this directly addresses that issue.</p>

<p>Any other fundamental skills, recommend below, but this is beyond a no-brainer for any weapon, and the combat feels very broken without it. </p>

<p>edit: Sorry if you already read this, resubmitted with Flair. </p>

<p>Edit2: Other high-priority skills recommended in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Grapple - Very useful for dealing huge damage on a staggered enemy</p></li>
<li><p>Kick - Helps stagger the enemy rapidly, does decent Ki damage</p></li>
<li><p>Sneak Attack (unlocked from the first opened Dojo Mission on Ninjutsu)</p></li>

<h2>Stat Softcaps</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally respec&#39;d today, and fortunately was smart enough to take notes on stat soft and hardcaps.  I was only able to test up to 75, so there may be caps higher than that, but based on the data I doubt it.  They seem to want you to be able to keep leveling forever.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Gold, holy crap!  Note to self, don&#39;t go to sleep immediately after posting theorycrafting threads.</p>

<p><strong>General:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At level 5, you gain 2 ninjutsu skill points and 2 samurai skill points, regardless of where you spend your points.</p></li>
<li><p>You gain another 2 samurai skill points for every additional 5 levels.</p></li>
<li><p>You gain 10 HP per level, and additional HP if you level Body or Stamina.  This HP decreases to 5 per level at level 100.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>

<p>(I&#39;m including the total health bonus, so subtract 10 from these values if you&#39;re comparing to other stats)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>6: +40HP</p></li>
<li><p>7: +35HP</p></li>
<li><p>8: +35HP</p></li>
<li><p>9: +30HP</p></li>
<li><p>10: +30HP</p></li>
<li><p>11 onward: +25HP</p></li>
<li><p>Once you reach level 100, grants +20HP per point, which is consistent with base HP per level +15.</p></li>
<li><p>vs Poison and vs Paralysis gain +1 per 5 points starting at 6, capping out at +10 at 51 points.</p></li>
<li><p>Also grants 1 samurai skill point per two points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heart</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>6-15: about +2.1 Ki per point (2 to 3 per level, +21 total by 15)</p></li>
<li><p>15-40: +1 ki per point</p></li>
<li><p>40+: +1 ki per two points (Tested up to 75)</p></li>
<li><p>Also grants 1 samurai skill point per two points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stamina</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>6: +1 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>7: +0.9 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>8: +0.9 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>9: +0.8 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>10: +0.8 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>11: +0.7 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>12: +0.7 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>13: +0.6 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>14: +0.6 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>15: +0.5 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>16: +0.6 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>17: +0.5 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>...from this point on it gets weird, it&#39;s rounded fractional amounts.  Basically it very slowly tapers off, no softcaps.</p></li>
<li><p>74: +0.2 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>75: +0.1 max weight</p></li>
<li><p>HP: Slight softcap at 10. 11 onward: +15HP.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you reach level 100, grants +10HP per point, which is consistent with base HP per level +5.</p></li>
<li><p>Also grants 1 samurai point per 2 points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strength</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>+0.1 Equip Weight Max and +5 Ki Pulse until 10</p></li>
<li><p>+0.05 Equip Weight Max and +3.5 Ki Pulse until 15</p></li>
<li><p>Equip Weight Max slowly tapers off again.  It might be a logarithmic function, it looks <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8SsCa-j6j9-psYVz-p469o31X33sKXRgdUZ83WdI98/pubchart?oid=468695239&amp;format=image">like this.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Ki pulse also slowly tapers off.  No softcap, but  40+ is +1 ki pulse per point.  50+ is 1 per 2 points.</p></li>
<li><p>Also grants 1 samurai point per 1 point.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skill</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ki pulse is double the bonus per point of Strength, with identical scaling.</p></li>
<li><p>+2 Ninjutsu Power until 10, then +1 Ninjutsu Power per point</p></li>
<li><p>Also grants 1 samurai point per 1 point.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dexterity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ninjutsu Power: Slight softcap at 10, then very slow and gradual diminishing returns.  (Basically the moral of the story of how Nioh stats work).  9 power per point at 11, scaling down to 3 power per point at 75.</p></li>
<li><p>Ninjutsu Capacity: Hardcap at 30 Dexterity (total of 30 capacity)</p></li>
<li><p>Ninja Skill Points: 2 skill points per point, no cap.</p></li>
<li><p>20 Dexterity is required to complete the mission to unlock Ninjutsu Mystic Art, which is a sort of softcap.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Magic</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Almost identical to dexterity.</p></li>
<li><p>Magic Power: Slight softcap at 10, then very slow and gradual diminishing returns.  9 power per point at 11, scaling down to 3 power per point at 75.</p></li>
<li><p>Magic Capacity: Hardcap at 30 Magic (total of 30 capacity)</p></li>
<li><p>Magic Skill Points: 2 skill points per point, no cap.</p></li>
<li><p>20 Magic is required to complete the mission to unlock Magic Mystic Art, which is a sort of softcap.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spirit</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Magic Power: Similar scaling to Magic, about 1/3rd of the strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Guardian Bond:  Slight softcap at 10, slow diminishing returns.  50 per point up to 10 going down to 10 per point at 70+.</p></li>
<li><p>vs. Yokai Realm:  2.5 per point, no diminishing returns or cap.</p></li>
<li><p>25 Spirit will unlock every ability from every guardian spirit, which is a sort of hardcap.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL:DR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most stats have a minor softcap at 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Health (Body and Stamina) softcaps at 10, then stays linear forever.</p></li>
<li><p>Ki (Heart) softcaps at 15 and again at 40.</p></li>
<li><p>Equip weight max slowly tapers off with no softcap.</p></li>
<li><p>Ki Pulse slowly tapers off.  Arguably softcaps at 40 and 50.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that gives skill points stays linear forever with no cap.</p></li>
<li><p>Magic and ninja power slowly tapers off with no softcap.</p></li>
<li><p>Magic and ninja capacity both hardcap at 30.</p></li>
<li><p>To my knowledge I have not yet seen an armor require a stat above 18, so that&#39;s another sort of softcap.</p></li>
<li><p>Figuring out weapon scaling is going to take way more science.</p></li>

<h2>Tips I wish someone had told me before I started delving into the mid-late game.</h2>

<div id="5tnxf1" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These are tips I wish someone had told me before I started delving into the mid-late game</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Light armor and Agility play a bigger part in ki consumption than they do on dodging. The lighter your armor (and therefore the higher your Agility), the less ki you use when attacking, the faster your ki recovers, and the more ki damage you take when blocking. </p></li>
<li><p>Weapons with the ability &quot;Change to Attack (stat)&quot; do not overwrite your current scaling for that weapon with the new scaling; instead, it simply adds that scaling to your available scalings to give improved damage for most builds. The same is true of armor and accessories with &quot;Change to Defense (stat)&quot;, though that simple provides a flat bonus based on your current stat. </p></li>
<li><p>Elemental damage is not always a good thing on a weapon. It may seem obvious to more seasoned players of things like Dark Souls and similar RPGs with an element wheel, but having a weapon that does pure physical damage is incredibly important when dealing with certain enemies, though having elemental damage does not reduce the damage dealt dramatically, instead seemingly neutralizing the added elemental damage. I highly recommend that you carry one weapon with an elemental effect, and one without (or with Poison or Paralysis effects, as those do not increase damage and split your damage types). </p></li>
<li><p>Each elemental damage type has a different elemental effect associated with it. Fire&#39;s is damage over time. Water&#39;s is extra damage from other damage types. Wind&#39;s is reduced Parry (or increased ki consumption on block). Electric&#39;s is slow. Earth&#39;s is double ki consumption. These can also stack with other effects like Poison, Slow (from Sloth Talisman or Makibishi), and Paralysis. </p></li>
<li><p>To obtain a weapon&#39;s Mystic Art, you must progress near the end of the game and have 500,000 Proficiency with that weapon type, then complete a final training mission. Only one Mystic Art can be equipped at a time in each skill tree, so choose the one that suits you wisely. </p></li>
<li><p>Ninjutsu and Magic Mystic Arts training missions are available after reaching a certain point slightly further in the story than weapon Mystic Arts, but only require that you have 20 in the corresponding stat to complete the training mission. </p></li>
<li><p>Even if you don&#39;t plan to have a Ninjutsu or Magic build in full, if you plan to use them at all for buffs, use a Book of Reincarnation and secure 20 in each stat to complete the final training for them later in the game. You won&#39;t have to keep the stats at 20 to keep the Mystic Arts after finishing the training, and the Mystic Arts only cost 5 skill points. The Mystic Arts unlocked through these missions for both schools have the option to make all your personal uses of Ninjutsu and Magic (as in, they affect your character only) cast instantly when you press the shortcut button. This is invaluable for Quick-Change Scrolls, weapon buffs, and things like Kekkai and Carnage Talismans (especially Carnage Talismans as you can whittle an enemy down to break their ki and then unleash the Talisman without a threat of serious retaliation). </p></li>
<li><p>Using a weapon buff that gives the weapon elemental damage will cancel whatever current elemental damage that weapon has of a different type. This does not seem to apply with Ninjutsu weapon buffs used on elemental weapons, or elemental effects applied to weapons with Poison (do not know about Paralysis). </p></li>
<li><p>Power Pills will cancel Carnage Talisman damage bonus in favor of its own damage bonus. Do not stack Power Pills and Carnage Talismans. </p></li>
<li><p>Kodama Sense equipment is instrumental finding the Kodama scattered around each level. When you find a piece of armor with Kodama sense, keep it and use to hunt Kodama.</p></li>
<li><p>Amrita Sense is helpful for finding bodies that have Amrita memories and items on them. In my opinion, this is the least useful of all the Sense effects.</p></li>
<li><p>Enemy Sense displays enemies on your minimap as small dots for common or small enemies and large dots for Yokai or large enemies, or enemies that do not respawn. </p></li>
<li><p>Treasure Sense shows all treasure chests in a level on your map as either a small blue dot for a small chest or a large blue dot for a large chest. Mimics do not appear on the map with Treasure Sense. </p></li>
<li><p>Prestige Points are gained by obtaining Titles, which have various and occasionally odd or difficult conditions. The two varieties, Agyo and Ungyo, correspond to different styles of play and have different Prestige bonuses accordingly. Agyo is more associated with Ki, elemental damage, and Yokai, while Ungyo is associated with weapons, items, and skills. Prestige Points are used much like Badass Ranks from Borderlands 2, giving you permanent passive bonuses for one of four random selections available to you. These selections move in a rotation, and you will not be able to receive the same bonus twice. After obtaining all titles, it can be assumed that you will no longer receive Prestige Points. </p></li>
<li><p>Certain skills that you find interfere with your style of play (such as the Axe skills &quot;Roar&quot; and &quot;Stone Mallet&quot; or the Dual Swords skill &quot;Random Slice&quot; for me) can be disabled by going into Skill Customization and selecting &quot;Unassign&quot; using Square on the default control scheme. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Flux&quot; and &quot;Flux II&quot; are the most important skills in NiOh, and you will need to learn to use them to fully utilize a weapon. Learning these skills is shared among all your weapon types, as are the skills &quot;Grapple&quot;, &quot;Ki Pulse: Heaven&quot;, &quot;Living Water: Heaven&quot;, Ki Pulse: Man&quot;, &quot;Living Water: Man&quot;, &quot;Ki Pulse: Earth&quot;, and &quot;Living Water: Earth&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>With the varieties of the &quot;Living Water&quot; skill, you can stand outside a Yokai Realm pool and dodge into it with a &quot;Living Water&quot; ki pulse to purify the pool. This technique can also be used to purify multiple pools at once. </p></li>
<li><p>Glory is easily obtained through co-op using the Torii Gate. Playing through a co-op level with a friend or random can grant up to 1,000 Glory or more per mission, depending on the level, and Revenants can still be fought when using the Torii Gate for the &quot;Yokai Realm with Companion&quot; option, making Glory farming much faster. </p></li>
<li><p>(This is my personal opinion) Each weapon can be used both aggressively and defensively, with varying degrees of success. The Dual Swords and Kusari-gama work both ways very well, with variable movesets in each stance to complement either style. The Sword and Spear are better suited toward defensively play and working around counters, positioning, and guardbreaks. The Axe is suited toward aggressive play, with a focus on hitting the enemy before (or while) they hit you and putting yourself into the thick of things. </p></li>
<li><p>(This is my personal opinion) Ninjutsu is best suited as a supplemental part for other primary builds. Dexterity and Magic have great synergy, and Dexterity also pairs well with Skill. Magic is similarly useful as a supplemental part of a build, but can be used as a primary stat later in the game thanks to equipment with the ability &quot;Change to (Attack or Defense): Magic&quot; allowing you to push fewer points into Strength, Skill, Heart, and Body. </p></li>
<li><p>(This is my personal opinion) Spirit is the most vital stat in the game above all others. Spirit allows you to have access to your Guardian Spirits auxiliary effects, and 25 Spirit allows you to have access to every Guardian Spirit&#39;s abilities. Later in the game, Spirit can also be used as your primary stat, with equipment that has the &quot;Change to (Attack or Defense): Spirit&quot; ability. </p></li>
<li><p>(This is my personal opinion) Choosing your Guardian Spirit based on element and Living Weapon strength should be secondary to its auxiliary effects unless you have low Spirit. The auxiliary effects of some Guardian Spirits are incredibly powerful, with some of the later obtained Guardian Spirits having effects like &quot;Paralysis +30&quot;, &quot;Unlimited Elixir +15%&quot;, and &quot;Enemy/Treasure/Amrita/Kodama Sense&quot; (and yes, the last one is really all the sense put together as one skill). </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if you don&#39;t quite know what a skill or ability does, use the Help command defaulted to the Options button to select the skill or ability and see exactly a detailed description of its effect. Some of the effects are very misleading. For example, the Shimazu Clan has the ability of &quot;Ki Regeneration +30%&quot; and the Guardian Spirit Kato has &quot;Ki Recovery Speed +20%&quot;. The Shimazu Clan ability is only granted when your health is low, as per the Help description, while Kato&#39;s ability is permanent. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to anyone who made it all the way through, hope this helps. </p>

<h2>Beginner Tips and Tricks roundup</h2>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5pkicm/beginner_tips_and_tricks_roundup/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('5pkicm')">View full post</button>
<div id="5pkicm" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>General</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>If the bar under your Amrita gauge is yellow, you can level up.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding Kodama is worth it. The more you collect in a level, the larger bonus you get when praying to them, and the more elixir you can hold. You choose what bonus you want by praying to them at a shrine.</p></li>
<li><p>There are Special Effects that improve the radar. <strong>Kodama Sense</strong> adds a green mark on the radar for Kodama, while <strong>Treasure Sense</strong> adds an orange mark for treasures. <strong>Amrita Sense</strong> adds a mark for bodies. <strong>Enemy Sense</strong> adds a mark for enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Shark Spirit <strong>Isonade</strong> gives the Special Effect <strong>Enemy Sense</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Kodama buffs are <strong>disabled</strong> in Twilight Missions</p></li>
<li><p>You can de-level your character by using the <strong>Book of Reincarnation</strong>, it refunds your spent Amrita and skill points. Beware, you&#39;ll drop your Amrita on death just like normal. </p></li>
<li><p>The passives in the Ninjustu tree are extremely useful, even as a non-Ninjutsu build. These include backstabbing enemies that are unaware of you, more damage to Yokai, and the ability to carry more Elixir.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pure Heaven Cursed Earth</strong> in the Omnyo Magic tree increases your purification range.</p></li>
<li><p>You can Ki Break an enemy by hitting them with a <strong>Shuriken</strong> or other projectile while they&#39;re out of Ki.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amrita Fiends</strong> will overheat by matching elemental damage, causing them to explode and die.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Consumables</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Elixir</strong> is a permanent consumable that will come back every time you rest at a shrine or die. How many you can carry is affected by the passive <strong>Medicine Man</strong> in the Ninja skill tree. Kodama you&#39;ve found in the region determine how many the shrine will restore. You can also find more on the ground from killing enemies or looting.</p></li>
<li><p>If your <strong>Elixir</strong> is missing, try pressing R2 (control scheme A) to switch item palettes. You also may have unequipped or consumed it all. The slot will empty entirely if it&#39;s gone, but it&#39;ll be back when you get more.</p></li>
<li><p>You can equip <strong>Elixir</strong> in the same directional slot on both quick sets, so you&#39;ll never be in the wrong set.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Salt</strong> will cause large amounts of Ki damage to Oni.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the <strong>Himorogi Fragment</strong> to return to the level selection at any time. It consumes all Amrita. It&#39;s infinite use.</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s also the <strong>Himorogi Branch</strong> that functions the same but does not consume Amrita, and it is a consumable that you must find.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Equipment</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Weight tiers affect Ki usage, regeneration, and roll speed/distance. Tiers: &lt;30 blue, &lt;70 green, &lt;100 yellow, &gt;100 red. Weight tier even affects some skills.</p></li>
<li><p>If an armor&#39;s special effects is grayed out, you do not meet the stat requirements. They&#39;re listed at the bottom of the table.</p></li>
<li><p>A green special effect indicates set bonus. You can view set bonuses by pushing L2 on a piece of gear to change to the SET BONUS page.</p></li>
<li><p>You can only hold 500 items in your inventory and storage collectively. A stack of items only counts as 1/500.</p></li>
<li><p>Combat raises familiarity on both equipped weapons, not just the one dealing damage.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Mimics</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>If you copy a Chest Mimic&#39;s gesture, it&#39;ll give you the <strong>Overjoyed</strong> gesture and drop loot without combat</p>

<ul>
<li>Alternatively, if you gesture incorrectly, you&#39;ll get the <strong>Frustration</strong> gesture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you whistle at a Chest Mimic, the creature will jump out without you getting knocked back.</p></li>
<li><p>There are Mimic Walls that work similarly. You&#39;ll notice their special markings and orange eyes opening when you get close. You get two chances to correctly gesture at them, the correct gesture is determined by what &quot;mood&quot; the gesture is, either blue, yellow, or red. Individual gestures have no effect, only the mood. There are occasionally revenant graves that hint at the correct one, something like &quot;Died from his <strong>anger</strong>&quot;(in red, indicating red mood) These do not reward gestures, but drop the enemy&#39;s loot without combat.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Blacksmith</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Soul Match</strong> allows you to take gear and upgrade it by consuming a higher level piece of gear. This raises the base stat (attack, defense) of that equipment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Refashion</strong> takes the appearance of the donor gear and applies it to the main gear. It doesn&#39;t affect stats. Gear gets added to your refashion pool immediately upon finding it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reforge</strong> allows you to replace a special effect of a weapon or armor.</p></li>
<li><p>You can inherit Special Effects to weapons by finding a weapon with a marked (rectangle symbol) special effect, then Soul Matching them when they both have maxed familiarity. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Multiplayer</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>To set a password, you have to go to the SETTINGS and ONLINE SETTINGS, then switch SECRET WORD to on, and it&#39;ll prompt you to enter text. Character limit is 6.</p></li>
<li><p>The left right slider on the Torii Gate doesn&#39;t let you set a password, it&#39;s only there to let you switch between password and public.</p></li>
<li><p>While summoned, you get gear drops just like the host, but they&#39;re randomized on drop. The level is determined by the mission&#39;s level.</p></li>
<li><p>Mission completion rewards scale to your level. This means doing a level 1 mission as a level 100 will get you level 100 gear. </p></li>
<li><p>There are two types of Co-op multiplayer. There&#39;s <strong>Standard Summoning</strong> like souls, which is done mid level at a shrine by offering an Ochoko Cup, and there&#39;s also <strong>Companion Co-op</strong>, which is done at level select by both parties, and works a bit differently. You can revive people when they die, and you&#39;re given a gauge. When the gauge empties, you lose. Your gauge goes down constantly while someone is dead, but reviving only takes a moment. When your gauge empties you&#39;re both sent back to the level select, and you have to restart from the very beginning of the level. </p></li>
<li><p>You can get <strong>more Ochoko Cups</strong> by killing Revanants.</p></li>
<li><p>If you dropped your Amrita and Spirit by dying, you will share a Spirit with your summon.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="63nurn" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, a lot of folks are probably wondering what they can do post game with all that Divine Gear. First and foremost, you CAN upgrade those pieces up to a +10 enhancement (i.e. Level 150 +10), but no farther (yet). The way you do this is through Soul Matching at the Blacksmith.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Soul Matching Divine Gear:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&quot;So how do I get to +10 if I can&#39;t find anything better than a +1?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
  You will find gear with up to a +5 (I&#39;ve even seen a couple +6 come from the final mission), but the enhancement is dependant on what region you&#39;re in and completely random. It is also possible to craft with an enhancement, but I&#39;ll get to that. The basics are what&#39;s important.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
  2 non-enhanced divine items soul matched will not give you a +1. You&#39;ll need to find a +1 and use it to get your first piece of gear TO +1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From there on out, here&#39;s how the math works:</p>

<p>&nbsp;
+1 soul matched to a +1 will give you +2</p>

<p>&nbsp;
+1 soul matched to a +anything will give you a +2</p>

<p>&nbsp;
You can&#39;t jump levels, so keep that in mind, since you won&#39;t want to waste a piece of +4 gear on getting something from +1 to +2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get up to +10 you&#39;ll need a lot of gold and enhanced gear. The math stays the same the whole way up so to get your +9 weapon to +10 you will need another +9 weapon. This means farming as many enhanced divine items as possible. so you can get another weapon to +9.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Crating Divine Gear</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&quot;You said something about crafting divine gear?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
Yes, you can craft divine gear for the small cost of 1-10 divine fragments to be used in the process. The way this works is that before you hit &quot;Forge&quot; on a piece of gear, you hit the triangle button to add divine fragments to the process. Each one you add (up to 10) will give you a percent chance to get a divine item (up to about 89%). I&#39;ve found you rarely fail at around 6 fragments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&quot;What about 160 (previously 320) gear?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
It is entirely possible to craft 160 gear provided you have cleared “The Queen’s Eye” in NG+. Also, there&#39;s no need to use divine fragments for this. <strong>NOTE: using demon horns or any other specific crafting ingredient has no impact on whether you get a 160 or not.</strong>  It also doesn&#39;t matter what rarity you shoot for whatsoever, a white 160 works. Also, if you soul match your already +x weapon to 160 it keeps the enhancement. If you upgrade to 160 before reaching a +10 enchantment, don’t worry, you can continue to upgrade to +10, it just costs more per soul match.  Any craftable equipment has a chance at being a 160.  This means armor, weapons and ranged weapons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&quot;Where do I get these divine fragments?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
Basically disassembling divine gear. I would recommend that at first you only disassemble gear that has no enhancement and you have no intentions of using. It&#39;s a good idea at first to build up a decent stockpile, because you&#39;ll need them later to further specialize your gear through re-forging (that&#39;s next). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few resources for crafting:</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5ux1os/setweapon_text_locations_guide/">Smithing Text List</a>: Thanks <a href="/u/Kantern86">/u/Kantern86</a>!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Re-forging Divine Gear</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&quot;Why&#39;d you say I need divine fragments for re-forging? I can still use Spirit Chunks!&quot;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
Yes, yes you can. However, just like when we were crafting, there is now the option to hit the triangle button to change the materials used to divine fragments. The added bonus here is that you have an increased chance to get blue/yellow/purple skills to show up on your weapon. These are typically stuff like elemental damage, increased close combat damage, item/equipment drop rate, etc. or Change to attack (INSERT STAT HERE). A really good post on reforging can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nioh/comments/5tvev0/reforging_faq/">here</a> (big props to the poster <a href="/u/BattleBra">/u/BattleBra</a>). The end game is brutal and likely so will the DLC content be, so you want as many great stats as possible from your gear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>a word on reforging</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;
There are stats you can&#39;t change in a re-forge like the &gt;&lt; (inheritable skill) symbol and the hexagonal lock icon (can&#39;t be replaced). The important thing is that now that you have armor that can gain familiarity like your weapons there&#39;s a new feature. If you have a piece of gear you really want to use, but the inheritable skill is garbage, you can change that by inheriting a better skill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
Here&#39;s how that works: If you have a piece of gear with max familiarity and you soul match it to a new piece of gear, the inheritable skill will transfer over (provided the new piece doesn&#39;t already have a competing skill). If the piece of gear your soul matching it to has a full load of stats (or already has an inheritable skill), the inheritable skill from the item you&#39;re using to soul match will overwrite the inheritable skill on the one you&#39;re soul matching to.  Again, the skill you’re inheriting cannot have a competing skill already on the weapon.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;
<strong><em>It&#39;s worth noting that to overwrite an inheritable skill the source must have max familiarity. Also, the target cannot have a similar ability already (ex: you can&#39;t get Change to attack (DEXTERITY) to inherit to a weapon that already has a Change to Attack (SPIRIT)). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ATVIr-dSH-n10925y_KLLihv1ucjmYXSSSEg_WqmnU/edit#gid=0">Here’s a list</a> by <a href="/u/Sjim8D">/u/Sjim8D</a> that details the available skills for each weapon/armor type.</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;
One way to get familiarity on something you have no intentions of using, is to equip it and run a Way of the Samurai mission a few dozen times. Accessories that increase Familiarity Bonus can help in speeding up this method.  Also, you&#39;ll get a new item called Nikawa Glue that you can use (it&#39;s like a Whetstone for armor), so just equip the item and use the glue to get its familiarity up.  The best way to farm these that I’ve found is to speed run Samurai from Sawayama on NG+.  You get 3 glues per run.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Farming all this stuff!</strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;
 Well, there&#39;s the Torii Gate, and then there&#39;s the Torii Gate. The best thing you can do at first is attempt to get as many of the NG+ missions done as possible. Use the Torii Gate for that, because you will have trouble soloing a lot of that content until you&#39;re sufficiently geared/leveled. In Kyushu, you&#39;ll be lucky to get a +1 and mostly just straight divines. It goes up in each region after the initial 3 (i.e. by the time you hit Omi you&#39;re looking at +4/+5, but the difficulty is significantly increased).  A lot of the patch 1.06 mission gear winds up being +5/+6 for the most part and is a good place to farm for the final run to +10.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;
 In the NG+ missions you have the option to use Ochoko cups to increase the drop rate of divine items. Any mission you can use up to 10 cups. This is hit or miss in my experience; I&#39;ve used cups and gotten 10-15 divines and gotten 1-2. I would recommend holding the cups for Main Missions since there&#39;s a lot more mobs to kill for the chance at divines, but if you can hold out, waiting until you&#39;re at Demon King level gives you a huge boost in the enhancement farming department. If you&#39;re just looking for fragments though, revenant farming is the way to go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
The best mission I&#39;ve found to farm revenants is <em>Battle of Ohashi Bridge</em> There&#39;s a ton of revenants you can get to without triggering the boss, the Himorogi Branch out and go back in. Once you get a rhythm going with that, you can get 40-50 divines in an hour or so. This serves 4 purposes; ochoko cups, gear that has inheritable skills you&#39;d like to get on your gear, cash from selling divines and divine fragments from disassembling. Keep in mind too, that the number of swords above the person&#39;s name (i.e. their difficulty rating) will determine how many divine items they drop. The more swords, the more items.
If you’re looking for specific inheritables, please check out <a href="/r/Shinju">/r/Shinju</a> to post a request or see what’s being dropped and where.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
 As for the cost of all this, the 1.06 missions dole out a ton of gold and are probably the easiest place to farm.  If you’re not quite there you can try <em>A Request from Ginchiyo</em>, <em>The Demon’s Daughter</em>, and <em>The Mountain of Remorse</em>.  Each of those will give you 150k+ gold per clear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for now. Hope it&#39;s helpful. It took me a while to figure it all out, so I wanted to pass the knowledge along. If you have any questions or just want someone to farm with, give me a holler. My gamertag on PS4 is Yamimbe.</p>
