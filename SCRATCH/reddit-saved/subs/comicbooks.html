<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>General newcomer to comics here, wanting to get into Captain America and Winter Soldier. I haven&#39;t read too much of them, but what I have read and seen (by way of the Avengers cartoon and the Avengers movie and the Captain America movie) I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only read a few trades, namely, all of the Civil War trades (including the Death of Captain America) and the Prisoner of War trade. I noticed that both are written by Ed Brubaker. Where should I go from here? Any help much appreciated.</p>

<h2>So I belong to a comic book club where we suggest graphic novels to read every month that none of us have read before. I am looking for some recommendations.</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone. as I said I belong to a club where we pick graphic novels to read every month and next month is my turn to pick. I&#39;ve been looking around for something I&#39;ve been wanting to read but nothing is ringing a bell. It needs to be below 15$ on amazon but don&#39;t let that limit the suggestions!</p>

<p>Id like it to be either a standalone or at least the first book in the series. 
Some of the things I&#39;m into to give you the flavor of my taste are: Saga, 
really anything by Brian K. Vaughn, 
Moebius&#39; stuff, 
Metabarons, 
anything by Geoff Darrow, 
Fear Agent, 
Hellboy, 
Invincible, 
Elephant men, 
Pride of Baghdad, 
We3,
 and probably a bunch of other things I cant remember. I love weird and awesome art and kinda bizarre stories. But as i said! reccomend me anything and I&#39;ll sift through it! Thank you a bunch for the help! </p>
