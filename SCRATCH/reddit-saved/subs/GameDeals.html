<h2>[Steam] Total War: Warhammer (25% off / $44.99) 48 hour deal</h2>

<div class="md"><p>Now, you may be wondering if the game is worth it, and whether it&#39;s worth it with or without the DLC.</p>

<p>Total Warhammer is described as a &quot;grand strategy&quot; game. What that means is you have a turn-based empire management game, with battles done in real time with a huge emphasis on classic warfare tactics (skirmishers, frontlines, cavalry, moral, formations, and so on).</p>

<p>Both of these merge together in the &quot;grand campaign&quot;. Note that you can play just skirmish realtime battles outside of the grand campaign, building an army and pitting it against the AI or real people via the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>This obviously includes Warhammer&#39;s more fantastical inclusions, such as giants, trolls, wizards, gobbos and so on.</p>

<p>Each faction plays very, very differently, both on the empire management side as well as on the tactical battle bits. A grand campaign as the orcs is going to be very different than a grand campaign as the Empire. </p>

<p>Each grand campaign will take hours to play to completion, and even repeated playthroughs as the same faction can be different depending upon different focuses, decisions, and so on.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in seeing how the game plays, or if you just bought it and have no fucking clue what you&#39;re doing, here&#39;s two youtube playlists by a great guy named Zerkovich who very clearly succinctly explains the many concepts that come into play:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHby7DEo3iFnHeF8Lm-MgJhw3r4eUvFT">Basic guides</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcUTk8OG3c8&amp;list=PLfHby7DEo3iGMygiQSNE5rD2zSPriuS54">Basic tactics</a></p>

<p>So even with just the base game, you have some fabulous realtime battles to skirmish with, and hours and hours of grand campaigns to play through with just the basic four factions. Very worth it, in my opnino, at $60, easily worth it for the discount.</p>

<p><strong>Mod Recommendations &amp; How To Install Them</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Installing the majority of mods is super easy, just use the newest version of <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/106/?">SnakeBite</a>.  </p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Essential</strong> mods:</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/45/?">Infinite Heaven</a></p>

<p>Nothing will top this as far as MGSV mods go. It&#39;s something that you need.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/464/?">Morbid&#39;s Side-Op Expansion Pack</a></p>

<p>Released quite recently, it adds 50 unique new side-ops that feel pretty similar to some main missions. Give you opportunities to recruit female soldiers as well (they&#39;re very rare in the base game).</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>Infinite Heaven requires you to be in the ACC for the first time you launch the game with the mod installed, so I&#39;d recommend waiting until you&#39;ve finished Phantom Limbs (mission 1) and then install IH and the rest of the mods you want.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Installing most mods is pretty easy, just use the newest version of <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/106/?">SnakeBite</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Besides the two previously mentioned mods here are some that <em>I</em> consider integral but you may <em>not</em> want to install based on what your preferences are:</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/463/?">R and D Heaven</a></p>

<p>Removes R&amp;D timers/deployment costs, makes online weapons available offline. The only issue with this is that you have to play offline for it to work correctly (either through declining the EULA when you start the game or [to streamline things] enabling offline mode via Infinite Heaven).<br/>
The base game has online only weapons with extremely high costs for both developing them and using them in the field. Unless you want to grind on FOB&#39;s (the shitty online mode) for an eternity and then wait up to two weeks of real time for the weapon to be developed, use this mod.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/236/?">S plus plus Soldier Mod</a>  </p>

<p>Adds S+ and S++ ranked soldiers to the game world. Previously there was no way to get S+/S++ soldiers other than playing FOB&#39;s so this greatly improves the experience if you prefer to play offline or you just don&#39;t like FOB&#39;s.   </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/353/?">Audio Redux - Less Noisy and Annoying</a>  </p>

<p>Removes the successful fulton dialogue and a number of other repetitious, pointless dialogues that become annoying after the millionth time you&#39;ve heard them.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/303/?">Suppress Popups V1.22</a>  </p>

<p>Removes a few more annoying, repetitious dialogues (example: Ocelot telling you that helicopters can shred you with their weaponry each time you see an enemy chopper). I recommend you download the &quot;Separated Snakebite Files&quot; and only install the &quot;Suppress Tutorial Popups.mgsv&quot; (this only disables the repetitive dialogues, whereas the others disable the saving icon and intel info).  </p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a few mods that I don&#39;t consider integral at all but still like:  </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/380/?">Bionic Arm Decal Removal</a></p>

<p>Removes the silly little icons off of the bionic arms.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/406/?">I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s Not Reshade</a></p>

<p>Tweaks the games color scheme to make it look a little less desaturated. No performance impact.</p>

<hr/>

<p>No idea when the next game will release, but I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be soon.</p>

<p>You can download the demo on steam and install workshop mods there, locate the mod folder and copy them to the mod folder in the Epic games folder. I recommend doing it this way since there was mods that were exclusive to the steam workshop (at least when I was playing).</p>
