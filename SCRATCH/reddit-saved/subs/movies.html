<p>Note - this starts with the development of the science behind it, starting decades before. Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Lise Meitner, etc. If you want to know how they got to the point of understanding this was even possible, as well as all the gigantic engineering problems involved, this is the one. Also does not turn away from the consequences for the people on which it was used.</p>

<p>Rhodes had the advantage of writing early enough that he was able to interview some of the principals.</p>
