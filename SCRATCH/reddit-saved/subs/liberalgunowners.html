<h2>PSA: Weed is still illegal at the federal level and “prohibited persons” uses the federal definition of illicit drugs</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(375)">View full post</button><div id="375" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know several states legalized recreational weed on Tuesday.  However since it’s still illegal at the federal level and it is federal law that makes illicit drug users prohibited persons, you cannot legally purchase or own a firearm if you use marijuana.</p>

<p>The ATF made this clear when they updated the 4473 with the stern reminder that weed is still illegal at the federal level.</p>

<p>One additional thing people don’t necessarily realize, you can become a prohibited person after purchasing a firearm and no one will come knocking at your door.  You may go years then one day you get pulled over and have your state legal weed next to your pistol and boom, federal felony charges.</p>
