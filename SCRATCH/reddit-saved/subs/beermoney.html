<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(First time making a thread here, hopefully I covered all my bases)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using different online moneymaking methods for at least 5 years now, and my favorite site is one I don&#39;t see talked about much, so I figured I&#39;d make a thread here to spread what I know.</p>

<p>Points4Rewards is the former sister site of SimpleGPT.com, a site where I made about $1,500 in a couple years. Around July of 2014, the sites merged, and now only Points4rewards exists. I&#39;ve made $278.46 since that time, and the site continues to be my favorite. I&#39;ve done this <em>without referrals</em>.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find the usual GPT methods on the site - surveys, offers, Crowd Flower tasks, offer walls, etc. My favorite at the moment is the Coupons offer, which you can complete 15 times a day at 12 cents each to earn $1.80 in about 15 minutes of work. There are usually a lot of very easy offers to complete, simple email submits, which can earn you 10-30 cents. There is a ticker showing which offers other users are getting to credit, along with a list of the last 100 offers credited. If you&#39;re looking to see what&#39;s crediting for others, this helps a lot. The site admin is great and has always been quick to solve any issue that might arise.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
