<h2>Connecting ChatGPT to PowerShell</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(76)">View full post</button><div id="76" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the help of ChatGPT I was able to make a program that takes a given task, comes up with a PowerShell command for it, runs it, and then give  you the results/answer. I imagine this is the future with how we will  interact with operating systems and software, hopefully Windows is already working on an implementation similar to my simple script! </p>

<p>Example of output:</p>

<pre><code>GPT: Hello, Welcome to GPT-PowerShell! How can I help you?

You: What is my computers name?

GPT: Your computer&#39;s name is DESKTOP-A0LIKL7.

You: How many programs do I have installed?

GPT: According to the PowerShell command output, you have 126 programs installed on your computer.

You: Can you please kill the spotify task?

GPT: The Spotify task has been terminated.

You: Can you please empty my recycling bin?

GPT: The contents of your recycling bin have been deleted.

You: How much RAM do I have?

GPT: According to the PowerShell command output, you have 24 GB of RAM installed on your computer.

You: Please launch steam

GPT: Steam should now be launched.

<h2>ChatGPT the ultimate teaching assistant</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(89)">View full post</button><div id="89" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found a rather effective method for learning Python, as someone familiar with PowerShell.</p>

<p>As someone who benefits from interactive learning and asking questions to form connections, I&#39;ve found AI to be a game-changer. In the past six months, the AI&#39;s direct feedback has helped me learn more than I ever did in the preceding years, even after passing eight Microsoft exams!</p>

<p>Since November, I&#39;ve been captivated by AI and decided to learn Python for two reasons:</p>

<p>a) to work with APIs and explore exciting applications</p>

<p>b) to overcome my struggles with math and hopefully spark my interest through Python.</p>

<p>To facilitate my learning, I&#39;ve been using the Edge browser&#39;s Bing chat sidebar to interact with the dreary Microsoft Learn pages.By turning complex concepts into engaging fantasy stories or condensing the information into digestible chunks, I&#39;ve been able to retain the knowledge better, even if it takes a bit longer to complete each module. (I have a pretty great prompt for that too if anyone wants it)</p>

<p>So I wondered if the GPT-4 model&#39;s ability to merge concepts and find connections could help me transfer my programming knowledge to Python. To my delight, it&#39;s been incredibly helpful.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Edge and the Bing sidebar (Creative Mode). Use any free Python website as context for the sidebar (or a PDF eBook if you have one).</li>
<li>For each lesson, paste the prompt below.</li>
<li>Remember to refresh the topic each time to avoid repetitive responses from Bing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Give it a try and see how it works for you! This method has been a fantastic learning tool for me, and I hope it serves you well too.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br/>
Re-explain the current web page, which teaches Python, in a more comprehensive and engaging manner. Keep in mind that the reader is well-versed in PowerShell. Utilize the reader&#39;s existing knowledge of PowerShell to teach Python more effectively, highlighting the similarities and differences between the two languages in the context of the topic. Choose an appropriate format and structure for the topic, avoiding the use of tables. Use markdown to enhance formatting and engage the reader, emphasizing critical Python-related terms or concepts by bolding or underlining them. Do not search the web for new information.</p>
