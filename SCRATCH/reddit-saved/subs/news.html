<button onclick="toggles(438)">View full post</button><div id="438" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p><a href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/">Full plan</a>.</p>

<p>Notable parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pause extended to Dec. 31.</p></li>
<li><p>Forgiveness of up to* $10,000 for non-Pell Grant debtholders. *Up to means debt will be forgiven e.g. you don&#39;t get a check for $5k if you only have $5k in debt.</p></li>
<li><p>Forgiveness of up to* $20,000 for those that received a Pell Grant. *Number/amount of Pell Grants doesn&#39;t matter; even if you only received one Pell Grant for $1, it applies.</p></li>
<li><p>Capped to individuals earning under $125,000 or households under $250,000.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposes a new income-based repayment plan which caps payments at 5% of discretionary income (down from the current 10%).</p></li>
<li><p>New IBR plan also raises amount of income that is considered non-discretionary to 225% of poverty level (up from current 150%); this means if you earn under 225% of poverty level (about $30,577/year or $15/hour for a family of 1), your monthly payment would be $0.</p></li>
<li><p>New IBR plan covers monthly interest so long as payments are made on time, meaning the loan would not grow due to interest even if the payment is $0.</p></li>
<li><p>New IBR plan forgives loans of $12,000 or less (original loan, not current balance) after 10 years instead of 20.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: Disclaimer for the following: The following in this edit is unrelated to today&#39;s forgiveness announcement, but I&#39;m putting this here as it affects quite a lot of people and few know about it. Since this comment is going to the top, I want to say <a href="https://predatorystudentlending.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PPSL-Sweet-Flowchart-7.pdf">check this list</a>. If the school you went to and got loans from is on it, <strong>100% of them are being forgiven</strong>. However, you <strong>must</strong> submit a Borrower Defense to Repayment application. (This is not automatic if you have not yet applied, but I believe they will be hard-pressed to deny an application when all prior applications are being approved automatically). <a href="https://www.ppsl.org/news/news/press-releases/landmark-borrower-defense-settlement-to-cancel-over-6-billion-in-student-loans-for-200000-borrowers-release">More info</a>. Even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BorrowerDefense/comments/sombdi/borrower_defense_application/">more info</a>. tl;dr is don&#39;t wait, <strong>go apply.</strong> You won&#39;t be part of the protected class if you apply after final settlement is reached. <strong>Note that this settlement is unrelated to the forgiveness/relief plan announced today and won&#39;t happen until the final settlement is reached in that court case. The bullet points are related to today&#39;s announcement, not this edit.</strong></p>
