<h2>I spend $100 every month to stay in my budget - and happily so.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(506)">View full post</button><div id="506" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will be the first one to admit that this is coming from a place of privilege. Not everyone has $100 lying around, especially with the staggering inflation rate right now. I&#39;m grateful to have a job that pays me enough to have this luxury that I couldn&#39;t afford at some point either.</p>

<p>I hired a Virtual Assistant to help me out with 12 hours&#39; worth of work every month. And I&#39;m so grateful that she exists in my life right now. She takes care of all the tasks that should ideally only take 5 minutes, but actually have serious consequences - financially and otherwise - if left unfinished.</p>

<p>Most of my obligations occur to me when I&#39;m driving to work, when it&#39;s too early/inconvenient to do anything. By the time I&#39;m back from work, I would rather just avoid anything that needs to be done, including responding to my body&#39;s needs. I have gone hungry on many occasions because I forgot to pick up groceries or just don&#39;t feel like doing stuff that requires executive function. Or I order takeout - which is very expensive, not just considering the cost of food but also the fact that any groceries I have in the fridge eventually go unused/bad.</p>

<p>Enter my VA - I call/text her every time I remember that something needs to be done + my priorities for the week. She makes any appointments, payments, pick-up requests, and &quot;discount&quot; web searches that I need help with - all I have to do is make a quick stop on my way home. She calls me every other day of the week to be a &quot;body-double&quot; for boring/unbearable tasks. Chopping veggies, folding clothes, putting stuff where it belongs - you name it. </p>

<p>Last week, I was telling her how I avoid staying at home because sometimes the mess is overwhelming for me, and coffee shops are just more pleasing to be at. This lovely person added about $20 worth of goods to my next pick-up order and sent me a 3-step procedure to make my home office aesthetically pleasing too. She saved me $40 worth of coffee and that was just this week!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not fair that we struggle with our ADHD, but it&#39;s also true that we&#39;ll never be magically cured. Get the &quot;luxury&quot; of having someone to <em>be</em> your executive function, if that&#39;s what it takes!</p>

<p>Edit-1: OMG, I gotta share these responses with her. She&#39;s going to love it!</p>

<p>Edit-2: The answer to &quot;how is that affordable for her&quot; is that she&#39;s Indian as heck (she has a strong accent too) - which I don&#39;t mind since that&#39;s where I came from, too :)
Based on the cost of living there, her pay for 40 hours actually comes out to be much higher than the living wage (NOTE: living wage, NOT the minimum wage).
If she decides to increase the cost of her services at any point, she knows that I&#39;m 100% on board with that or anything else she might need for a dignified life, since she gave me my life back too.</p>

<p>Edit-3: I just noticed that a lot of people didn&#39;t know that such services exist and you don&#39;t have to be super-rich to be able to afford them. Here is the list I used to get started on my journey: <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/virtual-assistant-companies/#gref">https://www.smallbizgenius.net/virtual-assistant-companies/#gref</a>

<h2>Rely On Systems, Not Discipline. "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(515)">View full post</button><div id="515" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Delicious chocolate-chip cookies sit in your cabinet, almost <strong>asking to be eaten</strong>.</p>

<p>You summon the discipline of a Zen monk, but alas, <strong>the temptation is too great</strong>—you eat the cookies.</p>

<p>So, what is the solution here? <strong>How can you be more disciplined?</strong> How can you <strong>generate more willpower?</strong></p>

<p>Well...<strong>you don&#39;t.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Just don&#39;t have cookies in the damn house.</em></strong> No willpower needed.</p>

<p>I know this is a silly example, but it actually demonstrates what I am trying to say pretty well.</p>

<p><strong>With ADHD,</strong> it can be pretty tough to simply <em>will</em> my way towards good habits and away from bad ones.</p>

<p>So, I do everything possible to <strong>create systems so I don&#39;t have to rely on willpower.</strong></p>

<p>How many times have you heard <em>&quot;JuSt DelEtE SocIal MeDia ApPs&quot;</em> to prevent mindless scrolling.</p>

<p>Well..<strong>.you can just redownload them in 2 minutes so that isn&#39;t very helpful</strong>. Personally, I have deleted and redownloaded Twitter &amp; Instagram a <em>shameful</em> amount of times.</p>

<p><strong>The barriers are too easy for my ADHD brain to jump over</strong> as it looks for what it really wants: That sweet, sweet <strong>easy dopamine</strong>.</p>

<p>Buttttt I can (and do) use an app (system) like &quot;Freedom&quot; that <strong>literally blocks</strong> pre-selected sites for a certain time limit.</p>

<p><strong>No willpower needed</strong>: I literally <em>can&#39;t</em> go on social media until the time is up.</p>

<p>How many times have I tried to start learning a new language, but lose motivation and give up after a few days.</p>

<p>Duolingo shame reminder emails and self-paced Youtube videos <strong>are little baby</strong> <strong>barriers</strong>.</p>

<p>My <strong>ADHD brain laughs</strong> at them.</p>

<p>Butttttt, now I <em>pre-pay</em> an online tutor <strong>who I promise</strong> my weekly attendance to.</p>

<p>Actually letting another human down while losing hard-earned money? Those are barriers that <strong>will have me show up</strong> to the damn lessons.</p>

<p><strong><em>If you are reading this, please please please internalize this one thing:</em></strong></p>

<p>You are <em>smart</em>. <strong>Really.</strong></p>

<p>***<strong>You are not dumb, or lazy, or unmotivated. You just simply don&#39;t have good systems in place yet.**\</strong>*</p>

<p>When you have your systems in place, the annoying parts of your ADHD is neutralized so that the positive side (namely, the creative thinking that comes with a lifetime of outsmarting your neurology) can shine through and help you achieve your goals.</p>

<p>I believe in you.</p>

<p>Discipline is overrated.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need it.</p>

<p><strong>Just don&#39;t keep those cookies in your cabinet.</strong></p>

<p>You deserve an amazing life my friends. I know you can have it.</p>

<p><strong>Much Love,</strong></p>

<h2>I am so tired of trying 10x harder than everyone else just to live a mediocre life</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/adventuringraw </span><span class = "numcomments">433 comments </span><a href="/r/ADHD/comments/v2jv1j/i_am_so_tired_of_trying_10x_harder_than_everyone/iatp7k6/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(522)">View full post</button><div id="522" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>To be fair, it&#39;s all in your head either way. Prefrontal cortex specifically, with some involvement with deeper neural structures.</p>

<p>I got way more chill about things when I started thinking about life a lot more like... chaotically, I guess. God as a feral creator, birthing a million strange, wonderful, and terrible things in a blindingly huge parade of pulsing life. Necrophiliac penguins, parasitic wasps eating spiders from the inside-out, New Zealand wildlife going extinct with the introduction of rabbits and ferrets, a strange new Covid variant emerging from a Chinese fish market.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I see koalas as failures for failing to adapt to losing Eucalyptus habitat. They had a life, the environment changed. I don&#39;t know if I see bald eagles as being THAT much less noble of a bird because they figured out how to scavenge the enormous piles of garbage our species leaves behind. Shit figures out how to live, or it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s not really a moral thing even, it just &#39;IS&#39;.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t able to do what you want to do. Whether that comes from ADHD, it&#39;s obviously a pathology/condition of some kind. There&#39;s a million different kinds of humans, we all have different strengths and weaknesses, we&#39;re all suited for different kinds of environments. This one is hard for people like us. You&#39;re no more a failure than the gray wolf in North America. Your nature just makes life very challenging. My own two cents: laziness is when you aren&#39;t doing what you need to do because you don&#39;t give a shit. You give a shit, so cut yourself some slack. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to change goals too to suit your nature. You don&#39;t have to try and make a path work if it&#39;s just not working for you. I changed careers radically five years back, it was a huge turning point. I never could have made what I was doing work, the decade I spent trying and failing was just... self abuse at a certain point. If water hits a block, it flows around. If your path isn&#39;t working, might be there&#39;s side ways that would work better. I hope you can find them. Be kind to yourself in the meantime, none of us chose our nature. We only get to choose what we do with it, and sometimes those options are... limited, or strange, or not respectable in the eyes of others. That eagle doesn&#39;t give a fuck about my judgement though, he just wants to find more ketchup packets, and I guess that&#39;s good enough considering.</p>

<h2>Strategies for resting well?</h2>

What is your strategy for resting well? I feel like no matter how hard I try, my brain never shuts up, I&#39;m constantly hearing this multidimensional chatter in my head and I cannot have one second of peace and quiet even if I&#39;m in the most peaceful place in the world. And when I sleep I always have this crazy wild dreams because my mind is always racing so I feel like I always wake up more tired than before I went to sleep. I&#39;ve tried meditation but it only helps a little bit. Exercise too, but then I get to a point when I&#39;m too tired to move my body and my eyelids feel like they weight tons but even then my brain doesn&#39;t shut up, it feels like the more tired I am the louder and faster my thoughts get. All I want is to get some restorative sleep and stop waking tired everyday.</p>

<h2>I’ve found the best hack to stop spending so much on fast food.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/NewYearNewYEET </span><span class = "numcomments">4 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/uyd38u/ive_found_the_best_hack_to_stop_spending_so_much/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(535)">View full post</button><div id="535" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I drive a lot for work, like about half my day is driving. Because of that, and especially in the summertime, it’s really hard to bring packed lunches because I have to be able to eat it cold, and I gotta make sure it stays cold because my truck gets super hot in the sun. So because of that, I often just go through a drive through or stop for some take out somewhere. I also just like to drink an insane amount of tea when I drive. </p>

<p>The problem is, I also really like getting teas and drinks, and other snacks even if I already brought a lunch and that eats away at so much of my money. I really wanted to cut back but I also didn’t want to take away something that actually brings me a bit of joy. </p>

<p>As you all know, ADHD makes it super hard to stay on top of a budget, plus impulse control, you get the drift. So I can tell myself I’m not going to spend money on fast food, but it’s never actually going to happen. </p>

<p>So I just started adding money to gift cards on my mobile apps. Whenever I get paid, I just add $20 on a Tim’s card, and $10 on a Starbucks card. That way I’m letting myself get a treat, but I’m still limiting the amount. I can spend in 2 weeks, and I’m limiting my choices. I still go to other places here and there, and the McDonald’s app doesn’t let you add a gift card which is tricky, but I’m still spending a lot less than I was, and I’m a lot more aware of how much I was really spending, so now I tend to get the cheaper options to make the $20 go further. </p>

<p>The big brain move is to delete your payment cards after the app so you can’t just reload the gift cards on a whim if you run out too soon, but I haven’t been able to bring myself to do that yet haha.</p>

<h2>Are you guys also very sensitive?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(536)">View full post</button><div id="536" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>This is absolutely an ADHD thing. CBT and DBT therapy and a great partner helped me with that. If someone says something mean, it is often a reflection of them. You&#39;re not responsible for their feelings or actions - only your own. You have to stop and think, do I care about this person to reflect on what they said for a long time? If not, say it&#39;s your boss or whatever, then no, I let it go. </p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you need to remember to never take responsibility for someone else&#39;s feelings. Call a neutral party like a nonjudgmental friend and vent. Vocalize your feelings and needs. Then meet with the person you were fighting with to take.</p>

<p>It can be harder to not be responsible for other people&#39;s feelings when it&#39;s someone you love. My couples therapist said when I am fighting with my partner it helps to take a step back from each other to cool down, write down what our feelings and needs are, then I read them aloud. It works well.</p>

<p>It can be hard to see at first that you aren&#39;t responsible for someone else&#39;s feelings, but try. It gets easier with practice. Without it, you won&#39;t be able to have a conversation with them later to meet them where they are at, and find out why they said what they did. Try to empathize with that person you care about in the moment.</p>

<h2>I'm afraid that if I get tested and it comes back negative i'm just a lazy fuck that's an underachiever</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/kingpangolin </span><span class = "numcomments">472 comments </span><a href="/r/ADHD/comments/uxyrod/im_afraid_that_if_i_get_tested_and_it_comes_back/ia2e4uj/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(537)">View full post</button><div id="537" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I’m from the USA. Stimulants for ADHD are schedule 2 drugs here so they are under very strict laws. Some Psychiatrists will just give out forms for you and a few people close to you to fill out. But I did the full psych evaluation because if I move or change doctors in the future I will always have those detailed results to give them and it will be less of a hassle to get meds in the future. My psych required it for me to get meds. </p>

<p>While it did suck - the results were a very detailed 30+ page report that highlighted areas I’m strong with and weak with and has been very helpful to gain a better understanding of myself. For example - I’m very intelligent, but I’m also very slow to process auditory information. This has led to people like friends, family, and my girlfriend to be very frustrated with me when I take a minute to respond to what they said. I never made this connection - but the report showed I was in the bottom 5% with auditory response speed and it suddenly made sense. I had always hated myself because I though I was doing something wrong even though for years I couldn’t fix it no matter how hard I tried, and knowing this I don’t feel as bad anymore. Im not choosing to be slow responding to people, my brain literally is slow to respond to auditory signals. However - the doctor I saw gave me advice. When in meetings or or anything - take hand written notes on everything. Don’t seek to understand but simply write it down. This is actually faster for me to comprehend what’s being said than listening. And I remember it a lot longer! When in conversations I was told to look at their mouths and lip read while listening and this has helped a ton too because it’s visual + verbal communication.</p>

<p>So basically what I’m saying is it’s not just an ADHD test - it helped me learn about my deficiencies and how to better manage them.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(552)">View full post</button><div id="552" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Yup, one bit of advice is depending on med Vitamin C can shut it down, so make sure you avoid Vitamin C until evening/nighttime when you&#39;re ready for meds to wear off (Think it increases metabolism of amphetamines or something, I looked it up after reading it on this sub) </p>

<p>Also, too acidic of a stomach can decrease med absorption, so especially drinking juice with your med can be a double whammy... Also gotta eat plenty of proteins AND fats for meds to work, takes both of those to utilize the med and make the neurotransmitters you need</p>

<p>Also, remember exercise and outdoors time can help meds work, 30 minute walk/hike sometimes helps me. </p>

<p>And finally if all that stuff doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s just a no-go day lol sucks but remember you can&#39;t help it, it isn&#39;t a choice, just relax and enjoy something fun and gear up for tomorrow!!</p>

<li>t’s not a competition with other folks with ADHD to see who “has it worse”, the only one we are competing with is ourselves.</li>
<li>There are endless combinations of symptoms so just because someone doesn’t have your particular flavor of ADHD does not make them any less authentic. (See #1)</li>
<li>Know your flavor of ADHD. For example, I also have at least two specific learning disabilities, dyscalculia, and I&#39;m also dealing with some nasty clinical depression.</li>
<li>If you can build a team of support. I have a great new therapist and an excellent psychiatrist. I realize that not everyone has the means to do this, but reach out to organizations that may help you get the support you deserve.</li>
<li>The secret to success is mastery of coping skills, NOT mastery of ADHD. That shit ain’t never going away, but it can be tamed.</li>
<li>Keep a Coping Skills Journal on your phone where you list all of the skills you learn and reread it when you have downtime. I have forgotten way more of these tricks than I remember and it’s because I didn’t keep track. No, those scraps of paper will not help you remember all this stuff... they just end up in piles.</li>
<li>Speaking of piles, accept them. I spent 25 years freaking out over those piles until my wife (she’s amazing!) taught me to accept who I am and work within the framework of that knowledge. The piles will never go away, but you can learn Tricks To help make them manageable.</li>
<li>learn to love reading. Many of us tend to hyper-focus on things and it’s often video games. I put thousands of hours into online games before I came to my senses. Four years ago I started my first novel in the time I would have spent playing WoW. That changed my understanding of time. I switched from gaming to reading (and then writing) and I have learned so much. Now I have a cool set of skills and not just some tricked-out avatar.</li>
<li>Blow off steam. Run, work out, hike, whatever but do something that makes you move. It’s a big part of dealing with this. My wife has been pushing this lifestyle change for 30 years and I&#39;m just taking it seriously. It&#39;s never too late to start.</li>
<li>If you use meds, use them. Take them on a schedule and set timers. It’s really important that we treat this holistically and pharmacology is part of that. If you don’t go the meds route then establish a pattern and follow it every day. I have about 7 timers set to help me get from A to Z each day.</li>
<li>There is so much new research on the way to treat ADHD, get current!</li>
<li>Holistic means treating the whole body. Eat right, no, really. I know how wonderful it is to sugar out but we need to maintain as much balance as we can. Diet and exercise are important parts of that balance. That whole reading thing comes in handy here.</li>
<li>know your role. In every group of friends, there is a place for the hyper one. Stop fighting it and embrace it. Just Be yourself. That&#39;s the key.</li>
<li>You are not perfect and will never be perfect. The Sooner you accept that the better. Remember... some people may seem perfect, but nobody is.</li>
<li>Nobody else is perfect. Everyone has their flaws. As soon as you understand you can shed all kinds of stress.</li>
<li>Instagram is NOT real life! There are some great ADHD accounts, but they are not you. Do your own thing.</li>
<li>There are assholes who will not like you. Why? Because some people are just assholes. Stop trying to make people like you and just be you.</li>
<li>If someone has been a certain way for as long as you have known them then don’t get mad when they act in character over something. You will never change the way people are and you will save everyone a lot of stress and drama by not trying.</li>
<li>There are things about having ADHD that neurotypical folks will never understand. Things like increased sensitivity to light, Cold, heat, touch, tags in shirts, the texture of food, too much noise, not enough noise, walking, sitting still, the constant need to fidget, saying &quot;what?&quot; in the middle of a conversation, blinking in and out of whatever is happening around you at the moment, losing stuff, forgetting to eat for a whole day and still not being hungry, the list is LONG. Understanding that this is just part of the package of ADHD was a big step for me and those around me.</li>
<li>So much has changed in the world of ADHD over the past 50 years. There are now over 400.000 peer-reviewed papers out there about us. Read and learn all you can.</li>
<li>There are some amazing podcasts out there that are perfect for our community. [<a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies">https://www.alieward.com/ologies</a>](<a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies">https://www.alieward.com/ologies</a>) and Rich Roll Podcast, just to name a few that come to mind.</li>
<li>Imposter syndrome is one of my biggest challenges, it&#39;s a daily battle to convince myself that I&#39;m not a complete fraud, but I still put myself out there every day and you can too.</li>

<p>Sorry, this is so long!</p>

<h2>I’m a psychiatrist and I’m wondering what patients wish their docs could do better in regards to ADHD treatment</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(571)">View full post</button><div id="571" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the record, I have ADHD myself and know what it’s like to be on the patient side and often feel like my doctors don’t understand at all and I just sit through it to get my medication. But obviously I am more often on the treating side and I want to know what your experiences have been so I can better treat all of my ADHD patients. Both positive and negative experiences are helpful, thank you!</p>

<p>Edit:
Thank you all SO much for sharing your personal experiences. I’m still getting through the comments but so far it’s been incredible to see that everyone can openly share their struggles and for the sole purpose of bettering care for others. I’ve treated hundreds of patients with ADHD over the years and while I have had the psychiatric training, read countless books and research on ADHD and continue to struggle with it myself, I was still able to learn a great deal from all of you and put some things into perspective. I truly hope that you’re all treated with love and respect by your doctors, and if not, that you’re able to advocate yourself and seek the care you deserve. Love this community. 🥺</p>

<button onclick="toggles(572)">View full post</button><div id="572" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I wish more attention would be given to inattentive types. </p>

<p>It took me 25 years to get a diagnosis for why I could never get my homework done, why I forgot about upcoming birthdays, why I could get lost in a new project for two weeks and then forget all about it when it&#39;s only half finished, why I was always losing track of time, why I daydreamed through math class, etc. Because I wasn&#39;t a &#39;problem child&#39; with an excess of energy and showed a lot of intelligence in areas where I applied myself, nobody ever considered ADHD for me. I lived with the toxic label, &#39;gifted, but unmotivated&#39; for decades because everyone was only looking out for 2 and 2 to put together that they completely missed that 1, 1, 1, and 1 come to the same result. </p>

<p>Psychiatrists need to lead the discussion on this so that parents understand and can get their kids help, particularly in the case of parents who are already of the opinion that ADHD isn&#39;t &#39;real&#39;, as mine were for the longest time.</p>

<h2>Anxious about maybe needing a prior authorization</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(574)">View full post</button><div id="574" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I take 60mg of vyvanse. I have tricare and their contractor is express scripts. Recently they made it so that I can’t get my vyvanse at the grocery store for $33 anymore and I’d have to pay $300+ as a copay penalty. I was going to take it to the pharmacy on an army base and have them fill it. Filling on base is ALWAYS free I believe. My question is will that trigger an prior authorization? I don’t recall ever needing one ever. My concern is that if I do need one express scripts’ form for that is super strict. For example I have to have taken adderall and failed with it(which I have) and the same with concerta(which I’ve never taken once vyvanse has always worked). Should I be concerned at all?</p>
