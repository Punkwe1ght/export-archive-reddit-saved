<p>I normally don&#39;t mess around with keto breads because they&#39;re so finicky and not really worth the time, but I decided it was time for damn sandwich. I read a ton of different recipes, and ended up modifying a coconut flour bread recipe based on people who had tried it and found it lacking. I am happy to say it turned out perfect on the first try. It&#39;s moist, it has a delicious and pretty neutral coconutty/butter/egg flavor, and holds together really well for sandwiches. Here&#39;s my recipe:</p>

<p><strong>Keto Coconut Flour Bread</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup coconut flour</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp non-aluminum baking powder</li>
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
<li>1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat oven to 350. In a medium sized bowl sift together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl beat the eggs until frothy and doubled in size. Add melted butter and almond milk to the eggs while stirring. Slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until very smooth. Grease a small bread pan (I used a 4x6 inch pan and it was perfect) and fill about 2/3 of the way full with batter. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.</p>

<p><strong>Macros for the whole loaf: 1143 kcal/85g fat/50g protein/18 net carbs</strong></p>

<p>Note: Using a small baking pan is the key to getting an acceptable height. I used a 4x6 inch pan.</p>

<p>Note 2: Make sure to use non-aluminium baking powder, otherwise your bread might turn green and taste tinny.</p>

<p>ENJOY!!!</p>
