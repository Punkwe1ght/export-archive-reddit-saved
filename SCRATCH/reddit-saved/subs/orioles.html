<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a staggeringly enormous difference between those two things. In the US, there&#39;s no doubt that blue lives matter. When a cop is killed, it&#39;s treated seriously, and the state makes every effort to pursue justice. The same is not true of black people.</p>

<p>&quot;Blue Lives Matter&quot; is a reaction to &quot;Black Lives Matter,&quot; which is what makes it highly offensive. Black Lives Matter brings up real issues with the US justice system, and Blue Lives Matter says &quot;Fuck you, we don&#39;t care, cops are more important.&quot; </p>

<p>Being offended by something which is offensive is not being &quot;overly sensitive.&quot; It&#39;s being reasonable.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Blue Lives Matter is 100% a counter to Black Lives Matter. The point is to make it black people vs police. Pick a side. Middle America is going to clearly side with the police. But that&#39;s a stupidly false dichotomy.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter is a necessary statement because too often black people are killed and there is no justice. The point is that currently our system often values black lives lower than other people. </p>

<p>Nobody can make the argument that the US doesn&#39;t value the lives of police officers. That&#39;s obvious bullshit. When a cop is killed, every possible measure is taken to get justice. We do not have a problem with US society and justice system undervaluing the lives of police officers. That isn&#39;t a thing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about muddying the waters. Confuse the message. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to ever have a Blue Lives Matter. That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t matter. Just that it is already recognized that they matter. There&#39;s no injustice that needs solving. It&#39;s 100% BS propaganda front he right wing in an effort to counter Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>Also, Baltimore of all places should understand this. Some of the most egregious examples of institutional racism come out of Baltimore. Frankly, if nothing else, the Os shouldn&#39;t allow this because it harms their brand.</p>

<p>Edit: to the other posters, don&#39;t downvote the guy. He hasn&#39;t been rude. Being ignorant of something is not bad, especially if you&#39;re genuinely trying to learn.</p>
