<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys</p>

<p>Off to hunt my first deer this weekend and hopefully successfully butcher it. 
I&#39;ve been looking at a few guides.   Does anyone have any number tips or guidelines they would be able to share,  eg (no gut shots).  </p>

<p>Also would really appreciate anyone&#39;s guide/link to butchering that they have followed first hand and resulted in great meat. </p>

<p>Thanks! </p>
