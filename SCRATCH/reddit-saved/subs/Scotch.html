<p>For me it is Ardbeg, the 10 was the first peated that I started to enjoy.  Oogie was the first I sipped from a swap where my face broke into a smile and loved the flavor explosion in my mouth.</p>

<p>Now I have the 10, Oogie, and Corry in my lineup, ready to try more.</p>

<p>What about you?</p>
