<h2>Got my first smoker. Thoughts on the Weber Smokey Mountain 22"</h2>

<div id="6bahbv" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After a winter of deliberation and anticipation, I saved up enough Amazon rewards points and gift cards to buy a WSM 22&quot; for around $200. I usually will grill 2-3 days a week with my Weber Kettle in the spring and summer, and smoked ribs and pork butts on it, but felt it was time for a dedicated smoker. </p>

<p><strong>[Smoker type]</strong></p>

<p>A few friends have egg smokers and they like them a lot. But I read a lot of thoughts leading me to believe the WSM was better than an egg at smoking (especially relative to cost) at the expense of not being able to grill. And compared to other dedicated smokers (like some cheap offsets and cabinets) it was both cheaper, more popular, and better reviewed. So I wanted a WSM.</p>

<p><strong>[Size]</strong></p>

<p>I was a bit torn on the size. A lot of reviewers stated the 22&quot; is a  huge fuel hog, and if you&#39;re not making 4 pork butts at once it&#39;s not worth it. After a year or fighting with a Kettle to smoke ribs, having to contort them and mount them on rib holders, etc... I was more than happy to deal with whatever problems came from having as much space as possible. I&#39;m glad I did. My first smoke was able to simply take a full rack of ribs and drop them on the grate, flat, and walk away. A rack of ribs extended about the full diameter of the 22&quot; grate so I was immediately vindicated in buying the larger smoker. </p>

<p><strong>[Seasoning your smoker?]</strong></p>

<p>Wow there were a lot of conflicting views, including some in depth multi day processes to &quot;properly season your smoker&quot;. I said screw it and just tested the thing out by smoking a full rack of ribs. Using the minion method, I ran the smoker with vents wide open. Temps stayed between 280-293ºF for the 4-5 hours it took to cook the spareribs. I&#39;m anticipating those temps will drop a bit as the seasoning forms, but it was more than sufficient to cook a rack of ribs. So if you get one and want to make a brisket immediately, you might have trouble running a bit hotter than you want at first, but otherwise forget seasoning for a WSM. Just do a few rounds of pork butts and ribs and it&#39;ll all settle down.</p>

<p><strong>[The Ribs]</strong></p>

<p>Went with a simple 2:1 pepper/salt sprinkle on spareribs, smoked with some maple and mostly hickory. They were super good. Better than anything I could get out of the Kettle at a fraction of the effort. I let them smoke for about 3.5-4 hours. Did not spray, mop, or wrap. If I were home for more of the cook I&#39;d have at least sprayed it with water/vinegar to keep the ends moist. The smaller ends got a little dry and crisp, otherwise they were tender, juicy, and would obligingly pull off the bone if you gave it a little tug, but otherwise held together. </p>

<p>The squirt bottle is a carolina mustard I threw together. Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, molasses, chili powder, honey. Mix in varying quantities until you like how it tastes.</p>

<p><strong>[Final Thoughts]</strong></p>

<p>I made the decision to buy a smoker sometime around last August, so It&#39;s been a lot of anticipation up until getting one and using it this weekend. So far I&#39;m exceedingly happy with the WSM 22&quot;, especially since I got it for ~$200. Looking forward to doing some briskets and other interesting cuts in the coming weeks. </p>

<h2>It ain't winter yet! Smoking ribs and tofu today (tofu is for my lady)</h2>

<div class="md"><p>Smoked tofu is awesome, when done well. And, like everything...that&#39;s the trick. Here is how I used to it (haven&#39;t done it since my ex and I split..like you, I did it for her...but most people would end up eating some so I smoked big bricks of it).</p>

<p>Two keys...you want it to pick up the smoke, but not too heavily and you want it to dry out a little, but not too much. I would get a big brick of the firmest tofu I could...the sprouted stuff works great if you can find it. I made a marinade of golden mountain sauce, ginger, and garlic (diced the g&amp;g fine enough I could inject it w/ the sauce into the brick). And then yeah, inject that biatch and let rest for an hour or so. </p>

<p>And here is the key: BANANA LEAVES (you can find them in the frozen section of asian grocery stores and sometimes places like whole foods). Slice the brick into about inch thick slices and arrange on a leaf so that you get a little space in between each slice. Wrap the leaf around the tofu. Do this w/ another leaf in the opposite direction and tie. I generally put the tofu on near the end of smoking when the smoke isn&#39;t as intense; put on the coolest part of the smoker. Depending on conditions, I&#39;ve smoked it for for almost an hour w/ pretty solid results.</p>

<p>I figured this out when I made Kalua pork (also wrapped in leaves). If you haven&#39;t tried that, I highly recommend it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to be a kitchen manager at a burrito place that did lots of vegetarian specials.  I did lots of grilled/smoked vegetables and tofu.</p>

<p>Use firm tofu.  Press it with a weight for 1-2 hours to squeeze some water out.  Slice the bricks in half lengthwise.  Marinate in a ziplock bag for 2-4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.  I use 1 part soy sauce, 4 parts salsa verde and pureed fresh garlic to taste.  You don&#39;t need a lot of marinade, just press the air out of the bag before sealing.  </p>

<p>Wipe off the marinade and pat dry.  </p>

<p>Oil the bars of the grill to help keep the tofu from sticking.  You don&#39;t want to smoke the tofu too much, or it will just get bitter.  I&#39;d smoke it for a hour or two.  Then after refrigerating to firm it up, I&#39;d slice or cube it for use in sautes.</p>

<p>The more moisture you can get out of the tofu, the better.  It&#39;s a good idea to bake the tofu after smoking, say, at 300F for 20-30 minutes.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,
I&#39;m planning on doing my very first brisket in my WSM this Easter and have a question about the point and flat. I&#39;m curious if the point and flat should be separated prior to smoking or after? I&#39;ve seen it done both ways, but curious what you guys think. If it&#39;s separated prior to smoking, is the cooking time of the point about the same as the flat?</p>

<p>Also, injection or no?</p>

<p>Thanks!!!</p>
