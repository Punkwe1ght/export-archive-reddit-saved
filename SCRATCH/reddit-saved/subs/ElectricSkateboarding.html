<p>Never skateboarded, snowboarded once, and just got a Meepo mini 2 ER a week ago. I&#39;m planning to use it to get to class. I have plenty of time to ride it around campus during the summer. I&#39;ve been practicing for about a week now, have about 30 mi riding around parking lots and campus, but really not comfortable going faster than 10-15 mph and going downhill is still scary with doubts going through my head. I&#39;ve been working on making tight turns, is there anything else I should be working on with how I will be using the board? Thanks.</p>
