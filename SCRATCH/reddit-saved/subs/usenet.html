<button onclick="toggles(3)">View full post</button><div id="3" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to say thanks for all the information and answers everyone has put into this group. I am a long time private torrent tracker user and have never really looked into alternatives. When I did the &quot;cut the cord&quot; a couple years back torrenting pretty much took a back seat to the Streaming services. Now that there are so many streaming services, I am back to the price it was for cable. Even worse, some of those paid services now have commercials. This has made me brush off some old hardware and log back into some of my old accounts.</p>

<p>The journey has brought me to this community, which has been very helpful. I have learned so much in the last few hours and just want to really say thank you. I will for sure be stalking <a href="/r/UsenetInvites">r/UsenetInvites</a> for a little while as suggested in multiple threads. I did read the wiki ... they know 26 is close to 30 right ðŸ˜† </p>

<p>Thanks again, Looking forward to not needing a 1:1 ratio or having a torrent run for 7 days.</p>

<h2>Looking for a sanity-check on my usenet setup before I start spending money</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(26)">View full post</button><div id="26" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about usenet for years, but never had a reason to switch away from RARBG, until the recent shutdown. I&#39;m now ready to jump into the deep end, but wanted to have someone give me the OK before I do that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mainly looking for movies, some old, but mostly recent titles. My beginner plan is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provider = FrugalUsenet</li>
<li>Indexer = NZBGeek and DrunkenSlug (registration is currently closed)</li>
<li>Download client = sabnzbd</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any problem with paying with a CC/PayPal? Should I be paying anonymously?</li>
<li>Should I be signing up for these accounts with an anonymous email address?</li>
<li>Looking at <a href="https://svgshare.com/i/oti.svg">this SVG</a>, FrugalUsenet is a sub of Newshosting, which itself is a sub of Highwinds (I think this is the backbone?). Does this mean I shouldn&#39;t add any other providers under the Highwinds umbrella? I should add something else like Giganews, right?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
