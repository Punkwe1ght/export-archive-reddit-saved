<p>Rising Stars:</p>

<p><a href="https://twoinchastronaut.bandcamp.com/">Two Inch Astronaut</a> is a band that shows that punk is alive and well in DC even though they are originally from Silver Spring (a suburb outside of DC). The band has been gaining more notoriety with the release of their new album <em>Foulbrood</em> which has even been written about by sites like <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/two-inch-astronaut-foulbrood-20141209">Rolling Stone</a>. Their unique blend of punk, post-hardcore, and indie make for a really interesting combination that sets them apart from the rest of the noise.</p>

<p><a href="https://priests.bandcamp.com">Priests</a> are a post-punk/punk band that are quickly becoming the biggest band in DC. They recently released their “debut” record <em>Bodies and Control and Money and Power</em> (they&#39;ve already released two tapes) and it caught the eyes of major review sites like Pitchfork. They’ve also done opening spots for <a href="/r/indieheads">/r/indieheads</a> favorites such as The Dismemberment Plan and Parquet Courts. They are incredibly powerful band, every bass riff is just as pounding as the drums. Katie’s vocal’s are just incredible, lyrically and in terms of pure presence. They put on a great live show, make sure to see Priests if they come to your town. </p>

<p><a href="https://sunclub.bandcamp.com/">Sun Club</a> is a indie dance pop that can only be described as weird although it shows mostly in their performance. The band can switch from sweet pop riffs, to tribal shouts in a matter of seconds with only the afro based drum beat holding them together. Originally from Baltimore, this band definitely puts in the work to play as many places as they can, from the Metro Gallery to the 9:30 Club.</p>

<p><a href="https://teensuicide.bandcamp.com/">Teen Suicide</a> is a local lo-fi, emo, punk band from College Park, MD with a rotating cast of members backing the notorious Sam Ray. They were initially active from 2011-2012 and recently reformed after their music gained a bit of a fan base, allowing them to sign to Run for Cover Records. They have strong ties with <a href="https://elvisdepressedly.bandcamp.com/">Elvis Depressdly</a>, <a href="https://sandy.bandcamp.com/">Alex G</a>, and the rest of the lo-fi community. Their music can range from punkish guitar tracks, to haunting piano pieces, to even bedroom pop. The band is also well known for its member&#39;s substantial amount of work with or in other bands. Sam Ray himself has two side projects both of which were well rated by Pitchfork. <a href="https://cool.bandcamp.com/">Julia Brown</a> is a more bedroom pop focused band, while <a href="https://rickyeatacid.bandcamp.com/">Ricky Eat Acid</a> is his IDM project. There was also <a href="https://starrycat.bandcamp.com/">Starry Cat</a> a one of side project of <a href="https://cool.bandcamp.com/">Julia Brown</a> that was created to raise money for Caroline White&#39;s surgery. Many of the other member also have other work with female vocalist and violinist Caroline White&#39;s band <a href="https://infinitycrush.bandcamp.com/">Infinity Crush</a> (kinda folkish) and former drummer Brian Sumner&#39;s work with the band <a href="https://cartoonweapons.bandcamp.com/">Cartoon Weapons</a>.</p>
