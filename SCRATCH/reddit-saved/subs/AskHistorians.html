<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pretty much exactly what the title says. Never really knew much about my father, but he&#39;s involved with a shady white supremacist group that is both based on a strange racist form of Christianity and white supremacist thought.</p>

<p>Why did this become -so- prominent in the nineties? Why do ALL of these groups believe the same New World Order conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve managed to trace most of it back to a guy named Wesley Swift who opened a Christian Identity church back in the seventies. I would be -very- interested in learning about all the intersections between the radical right. Explaining the politics and circumstances behind things like Ruby Ridge and the formation of The Order from a sociopolitical perspective would be awesome. </p>

<h2>Am I, a person living in the West, currently getting any thing out of of the medical experiments performed by the Third Reich and the Japanese Army during World War 2?</h2>

<p>I have written about this previously <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3yqab9/did_the_axis_medical_experiementation_nazi_and/cygqld1">here</a> and I will copy/paste my previous answer:</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t give you anything on the Japanese medical experiments (I have steered as clear of Unit 731 and the other medical experimental units of the Japanese as I can) but I can speak to Nazi medical experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to clarify:</strong> I&#39;m familiar enough with secondary literature on medical experiments and the developments of medical ethics (see Weindling&#39;s publication above) to be confident that Unit 731 did not produce good science but not knowledgeable enough on the subject to provide a detailed run-down. I sincerely hope an expert from among the user base or the flaired users comes along and provides more detail on this</p>

<p>First off, contrary to popular myth - baffling that it is still around -, the Nazi medical experiments neither gave any significant advances nor were particularly scientific. These experiments were crimes under the guise of research.</p>

<p>We can divide Nazi medical experiments in roughly three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Medico-Military Research</p></li>
<li><p>Racially Motivated Experiments</p></li>
<li><p>Miscellaneous Experiments</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To start off with the latter two since with them it is easiest to dismiss them as what they were - useless junk science.</p>

<p>The <strong>racially motivated experiments</strong> consisted of the fertility research, the twin experiments, and the skeleton research. The fertility experiments, mostly conducted at Auschwitz and Ravensbrück by Carl Clauberg and others mainly aimed at developing an easy, quick to do method for the sterilization of a large group of people. The idea was to develop a method of quickly sterilizing &quot;half&quot; and &quot;quarter&quot; Jews either by injection or by use of x-rays. Tested on hundreds of subjects under often appalling conditions, these experiments never came to fruition.</p>

<p>The twin Experiments were scientifically flawed from the onset as every doctor will be able to tell. Mainly, Mengel&#39;s idea was to study twins with such experiments like if changing the eye color of one twin would change the eye color of the other twin or how sew twins together to create conjoined twins.</p>

<p>The skeleton research is attributed to Dr. August Hirt at Strassburg University. He wanted a collection of Jewish skeletons in order to study how to find the skeletal markers for Jewishness. To that end several hundred prisoners from various camps were gassed or otherwise murdered for him.</p>

<p>The <strong>miscellaneous experiments</strong> concern mainly experiments in researching how fast a poison intended for executions would kill people or just timing how long it would take people to bleed to death. These often didn&#39;t even bother with a medical justification and can most certainly be qualified as &quot;just&quot; another way to kill Concentration Camp prisoners.</p>

<p>The <strong>medico-military research</strong> are probably those best known aside from Mengele&#39;s twin experiments. These consisted of submersing people in freezing water in order to study either how long they could survive and if there was a method of warming them again, putting people in decompression chambers in order to study the effects of pilots ejecting at high altitudes, giving people sea water to drink in order to study its potability, various wound experiments with either infecting people or trying to transplant nerves, and TB experiments.</p>

<p>Several of those can be dismissed right out of hand because of their flawed basis such as the TB experiments where the responsible doctor, Heißmeyer, sought to prove that TB was not an infectious disease but an &quot;exhaustive&quot; organism to which the &quot;degenerate body of Jews&quot; was more susceptible.</p>

<p>Some of the others however, look when only regarded superficially as if there was actual scientific value in them. Most publicized are probably the Dachau hypothermia experiments conducted by Sigmund Rascher who also conducted the high altitude experiments since the former ones have the most material left and some researchers have tried to use their findings in journals and have been rejected for it. The hypothermia experiments are however also a good case to show why all this was rather bad science:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flawed premises</li>
</ul>

<p>Nazi doctors were Nazis. That meant that they were rather enthusiastic about Nazi racial theory. Often these studies were intended to prove Nazi racial theory or at least contained Nazi racial theory in their premises. As far as can be told, Rascher in the case of the hypothermia experiments, also thought that different groups were to be affected differently. Basically, if a Russian POW froze to death in a certain amount of time, that time had to be longer for a German.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flawed experimental design</li>
</ul>

<p>To start with the obvious: Concentration Camp inmates do not good subject for scientific study make. The bodies of malnourished, tortured, and previously almost worked to death people tend not to behave the same way as the bodies of healthy subjects. Also - and this being a pretty good indicator for how bad these studies really were - in Rascher notes we find no segregation between different groups. He basically just submerged people but never wrote down who was clothed, who was naked, who was unconscious, who was healthy etc. etc. as well as no record of how cold the water was. Also, no cardiological measuring or blood pressure taking took place. All this is pretty basic stuff for your run of the mill experiment but Rascher apparently didn&#39;t even bother to do that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flawed analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis of the results by Rascher are inconsistent and allover the place. For some experiments, it is stated that the goal was not produce fatalities, for others it apparently was. References to standard nomenclature in connection to cardiac arrests is lacking. And Rascher in the end finds that it makes no difference if the water is 2°C or 12°C - something demonstrably false.</p>

<p>All these issues haunt the Nazi medical experiments. They were conducted without an orderly experimental protocol, with inadequate methods and an erratic execution, are riddled with inconsistencies and data falsification and also suffer greatly from the fact that for most of them full data was never published, let alone reviewed by anyone other than maybe Heinrich Himmler, who was not known for his strict scientific mind.</p>

<p>As for for the second point of what motivated these doctors to conduct such experiments, it is not easier to answer beyond the obvious that they were Nazis, really hated the people they experimented on, and maybe just wanted to try some stuff. The fact that even those like Rascher of whom at the end of the war it was thought that he was interested in results but used unethical methods, did in fact not only use unethical methods but hardly used any scientific methods at all, points to a motivation more influenced by Nazi ideology and personal cruelty. I mean, even with a scientific goal in mind, it takes a special kind of person to operate on someone without anesthesia and try to transplant a nerve while they are awake or to just dump someone in a decompression chamber.</p>

<p>In the end, their motivation was probably not very different from those of other Nazi perpetrators in that there was the deeply held believe that their subjects were degnerate and a danger to the German race and something had to be done about them resp. shit that they could do pretty much all they stuff they dreamt up to them.</p>

<p>According to them, far from their traditional image, Cathars were reactionaries left behind by a top-down purifying Church reformist revolution.

Many of those traditionally attributed to them are inaccurate, exaggerated or reflected their poverty and remoteness, not doctrinary views legated by heretic sects.

<p><a href="/u/bemonk">/u/bemonk</a>:</p>

<p>Fell in love with the history of alchemy while a tour guide in Prague and has been reading up on it ever since. I do the <a href="http://historyofalchemy.com/podcast.html">History of Alchemy Podcast</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/podcast/history-of-alchemy-podcast/id601738089?mt=2">backup link</a> in case of traffic issues). I don&#39;t make anything off of this, it&#39;s just a way to share what I read. I studied Business along with German literature and history.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Bemonk">/u/Bemonk</a> can speak to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>neo-platonism, hermeticism, astrology and how they tie into alchemy</p></li>
<li><p>Alchemy&#39;s influence on actual science</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/u/MRMagicAlchemy">/u/MRMagicAlchemy</a></p>

<p>First introduced to Carl Jung&#39;s interpretation of alchemy as a freshman English major. His interest in the subject rapidly expanded to include both natural magic and alchemy from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the 19th-century occult revival. Having spent most of his career as an undergraduate studying &quot;the occult&quot; when he should have been reading Chaucer, he decided to pursue a M.S. in History of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>His main interest is the use of analogy in the correspondence systems of Medieval and Renaissance natural magic and alchemy, particularly the Hermetic Tradition of the Early Renaissance. </p>

<p><a href="/u/MRMagicAlchemy">/u/MRMagicAlchemy</a> can speak to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>19th century revival</p></li>
<li><p>Carl Jung&#39;s interpretation of alchemy</p></li>
<li><p>Chaos Magic movement of the late 20th Century - sigilization</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We can both speak to alchemical ideas in general</strong>, like: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>philospher&#39;s stone/elixir of life, transmutation, why they thought base metals can be turned into gold. Methods and equipment used. </p></li>
<li><p>Other occult systems that tie into alchemy: numerology, theurgy/thaumatargy, natural magic, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Medical alchemy&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DE9m4wQ.jpg">a picture</a> is worth a thousand words (made just for you guys)</p>

<p>Edit: I (<a href="/u/bemonk">/u/bemonk</a>) am dropping off for a few hours but will be back later.. keep asking! I&#39;ll answer more later. This has been great so far! Thanks for stopping by, keep &#39;em coming!</p>

<p>What material/philosophical benefit does a neo-Nazi or White supremacist have to saying the Holocaust either didn&#39;t happen or it was grossly exaggerated? </p>

<p>My thought was that unfortunately they of all people would be the first to a) say it happened, b) express some kind of glee that it happened and c) use it as a point of warning/chiding toward all currently living Jewish folks.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s just a head-scratcher because it seems silly and counter-productive to deny such a massive world event. And please no write-off answers like &quot;well it&#39;s because they live in a fantasy world&quot; - yes I understand there is much misinformation they rely on but I&#39;d like to grant that there&#39;s a large number of these people who are of at least average intelligence, and a decent amount who are above-average, if not just for the sake of good-faith answers. </p>

<p>Thanks for the consideration!</p>

<h2>Why did the number of serial killers and victims spike from the late 70's through the early 90's?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(301)">View full post</button><div id="301" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>This is a great question, and fortunately for me, it&#39;s a pretty easy one to answer! I have written another comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k39olf/comment/ge32j3j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">right here</a> that brings up some similar themes to what I&#39;ll write below, if you feel like checking that one out or reading more. </p>

<p>I&#39;m procrastinating on grading final exams and dealing with my flooded email inbox, so I&#39;m open to follow-up questions on this one for a while. If I don&#39;t get to it today, I&#39;ll try my best to get to it later. </p>

<h1>tl;dr:</h1>

<p><strong>All</strong> crime rates spiked from the late 70s through the early 90s. Serial killings were no exception. They were, and are, exceedingly rare, despite receiving excessive media attention. The answer to the question of why serial killings spiked in the 70s-90s is no more readily available than the answer to the question of why crime spiked in the 70s-90s, unfortunately. </p>

<p>I broke this down into three comments. References are linked in the comments in a few places, but my big list of references cited are in Part 3. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Part 1: Crime rates as a whole spiked from the 70s through the early 90s.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rfxew9/comment/hokubwo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Part 2</a>: Criminologists don&#39;t really know why crime rates spiked during this time period. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rfxew9/comment/hokueme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Part 3</a>: Criminologists REALLY don&#39;t know why serial killers act at all, but we can (probably) use the same logic behind the other theories of crime rates to try to understand serial killers. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 1: Crime rates as a whole spiked from the 70s through the early 90s.</h2>

<p>First and foremost, you should know that serial killers were, and are, exceedingly rare. For instance, Sturup (2018) notes that less than 2% of all homicides can be attributed to serial homicide offenders. Their literature review is worth the read, as it includes citations from several different countries (including Sweden, the U.S., and England), and surveys literature that studies the time period you specified (70s through 90s). </p>

<p>More to your question, <strong>all</strong> crime spiked from the late 70s through the early 90s. In fact, the crime rate started slowly creeping up right after WWII, spiked way up around the 1980s, and just didn&#39;t stop until the mid-90s (at which point it plummeted and it mostly continues to drop today). This includes both violent and nonviolent crime. The FBI&#39;s <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend">Crime Data Explorer</a> (CDE) is freely available online and is pretty easy to use. The CDE is a compilation of police report data from 1985 to 2020 (and 2021 data will probably be available by mid-2022), as part of the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program (<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr">read more on the FBI&#39;s website</a>). It does not include data from before 1985 because of how the UCR works - police agencies voluntarily report into the UCR, and it wasn&#39;t until the late 1970s/early 1980s that enough police departments were using it to make the data reliable. </p>

<p>Something that you should know when interpreting police report data: it is susceptible to an issue that criminologists call the &quot;dark figure of crime&quot; -- which refers to all the crime that does not get reported to the police. Some types of crime are more susceptible to this dark figure of crime than others; for instance, hate crimes are notoriously susceptible because the people who are most likely to be targeted by hate crimes also tend to be the people who are least trusting of the police and are least likely to make a report. Thus, we only know the &quot;true&quot; prevalence of certain types of crime through the use of self-report data: that is, asking a representative sample of people (e.g. via a survey) if they have ever been a victim of crime. Some of these self-report surveys will also ask if the person then reported that crime to the police - so researchers have well-established the existence of under-reporting of certain types of crime (Pezzella et al., 2019). </p>

<p>Even though we have research going all the way back to the 1960s (for instance, Biderman &amp; Reiss, 1967) that comments on the dark figure of crime, it was not until around the 1980s or so that criminologists/researchers consistently started using self-report data to cross-check police report data, and it also wasn&#39;t until around that time period that researchers were learning the right questions to ask to make sure that peoeple were properly self-reporting crime on surveys (Fisher et al., 2010). Thus, data from before the 1980s - and in many cases, data from the 1980s-1990s - is methodologically flawed, and requires careful thought to consider what the data is <em>really</em> saying.</p>

<p>The type of crime that has the <strong>lowest</strong> dark figure is homicide. In other words, homicide/missing people almost always get reported to the police. So, when researchers/scholars want to get the best estimate of a crime rate for a given period of time, given that the &quot;dark figure&quot; is so prevalent in almost every crime type, they look to homicide data - working off the assumption that homicides/missing people have mostly &quot;always&quot; been reported to the police, and police data has been used longer than self-report survey data.</p>

<p>I say all of this because your question has an underlying assumption that the number of serial killers/victims of serial killings spiking in the 70s-90s is &quot;unique,&quot; or that there was something about that time period that created special opportunities for serial killers to thrive. The reality of the situation is that <strong>all</strong> crime was spiking at that time, and serial killers were no exception ... and it just so happens that the 70s-90s was a time period during which homicide data was the most widely used data for measuring overall crime rates, outside of certain academic circles where they were trying more innovative techniques using self-report data (and of course, the federal government was funding grants at that time to explore those innovative self-report techniques - Bonnie Fischer, who I cited earlier, was one such recipient of massive federal funding for her research into this issue with regards to sexual violence, like rape).</p>

<h2>I am the lowest ranking international master at Chess in 2020. I wake up and find myself in the 1920's chess scene. What am I able to revolutionize in theory?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Spreek </span><span class = "numcomments">97 comments </span><a href="/r/AskHistorians/comments/105sqco/i_am_the_lowest_ranking_international_master_at/j3dccmf/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(305)">View full post</button><div id="305" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Here is a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/%7Eregan/papers/pdf/Reg12IPRs.pdf">paper</a> by Ken Regan which does statistical analysis comparing players/tournaments of the past to today.</p>

<p>For example, by his analysis, the famous tournament New York 1927 had a intrinsic rating of 2579, compared to top tournaments of today that have intrinsic ratings of generally in the mid 2700s. (So you can sorta think of the intrinsic rating as well calibrated to actual ratings of today -- since most of the top grandmasters are rated in the mid-high 2700s.)</p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s fair to say that if we took the <em>worst</em> International Master in the world, who likely would have a FIDE rating of something in the 2100-2300 range -- probably because they are old or got their IM title in an unusual way like winning a world youth tournament -- then they would not be competitive for the world title or in top tournaments in the 1920s. (Taking the top end of that range, a 2300 would be expected to score 25% against a 2500, so it&#39;s clear that they would not have hopes of being very competitive in New York 1927 or other top events of the day).</p>

<p>As for the related question about theory, I imagine almost all strong chess players today could contribute a lot to opening theory in the 1920s (at least to the openings they play and remember the analysis of!). That is almost certainly the area of the game that has been most revolutionized by computers -- since top players are generally rattling off 10-30 moves of the engine&#39;s best lines. It&#39;s worth noting that 2020 is an interesting time to place this question, since engines were undergoing a massive improvement in strength and insight due to new neural networks (originally pioneered by DeepMind&#39;s AlphaZero). Engines were going from extremely superhuman to absurdly superhuman -- and probably closer to the latter by 2020.</p>

<p>For reference, the top engine of 2020, Stockfish 11, <a href="http://www.cegt.net/40_4_Ratinglist/40_4_AllVersion/rangliste.html">had an estimated rating somewhere in the 3500-3600 range</a>. So it is absurdly better than the best humans ever (who have maxed out in the mid 2800s). It&#39;s not even in the same league. Any analysis that our hypothetical time traveler remember would almost certainly affect opening theory substantially. Of course, it would likely be limited to those variations that the player actually played and knew.</p>

<p>Even the variations they didn&#39;t play, they would know which lines are considered best by the engines and top players of 2020, which they would quite possibly share with other players who would perform their own analysis. For example, I consider it very likely that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Defence_(chess)">Berlin Variation of the Ruy Lopez</a>, nowadays considered best play for both sides by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2206625119">many top engines</a> would likely come back into fashion sooner if there was a time traveler in the scene. </p>

<p>If you are interested in more about how engines have revolutionized chess, I can highly recommend the books and youtube videos of Matthew Sadler, Game Changer (with coauthor Natasha Regan) and The Silicon Road to Chess Improvement.</p>

<h2>Was the CIA involved in selling Crack Cocaine to inner city persons to fund secret armies in Nicaragua?</h2>

<h2>Is there evidence that the FBI flooded black communities with drugs in the civil rights era?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/A_Soporific </span><span class = "numcomments">112 comments </span><a href="/r/AskHistorians/comments/4r7ru5/is_there_evidence_that_the_fbi_flooded_black/d4z2knv/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(319)">View full post</button><div id="319" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>There are a number of sources, but the most prestigious one is the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series of Articles in 1996. A rather respected investigative journalist name Gary Webb examined the relationship between the Contras, Central American right-wing rebel groups active from 1979 to the early 1990&#39;s, and the CIA. Congress decided to not fund the attempted overthrow of foreign governments, but the CIA pretty clearly was involved in funding such groups by letting them use government assets to smuggle drugs. This was contemporaneous with the Iran-Contra scandal, a similar attempt to fund rebellion without relying on Congressionally appropriations.</p>

<p>Gary Web later published a book alleging that the CIA then specifically targeted black neighborhoods in Los Angeles in the late 70&#39;s as the end point of this plot line. People were, quite justifiably outraged. There were several investigations by the local police, state officials, and Congress itself. The Justice Department report indicated that there were two major drug dealers in Los Angeles who had close ties to the CIA and were probably supplied by CIA, they were not the ones to introduce crack cocaine nor were they the biggest dealers in the neighborhood. The House Select Committee Report disagreed, suggesting that while the two drug dealers in question did have tenuous contact with CIA-affiliated individuals (most notably a smugger that the CIA bailed out once) they mostly had Non-CIA suppliers and it was unclear how much of their drugs had come from CIA-related sources.</p>

<p>So, it is historical fact that the CIA did get into the drug trade during the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s in Central America to help fund rebel groups in nations that were identified as communist and socialist. Much of those drugs ended up in the United States, the largest drug market at the time. Some individual dealers did have contact with the CIA, but the amount of drugs coming from these questionable sources was insignificant to the overall trend. Given that the CIA had been involved with Heroine smuggling from the end of the Second World War up until the Vietnam War and involvement in the production of LSD it&#39;s unclear that the CIA had any meaningful institutional control over where these drugs ended up.</p>

<p>The explosion in drugs and drug-related crime coincided with the CIA&#39;s foray into cocaine smuggling, which leads some to conclude a causational link. But, frankly, it&#39;s probably the other way around. The beginning of serious drug problems left a lot of &quot;free money&quot; laying around to be taken advantage of by bad actors in both espionage and organized crime. And the flooding of black communities with drugs and addicts merely meant that they were existing buyers for what the Contras were selling.</p>

<p>Gary Webb&#39;s assertion that the CIA introduced crack to black neighborhoods and those that the FBI was involved in flooding black communities with drugs were unfounded, and at best massive exaggerations of otherwise well documented and ultimately self-defeating initiatives by US intelligence services. Though, it does provide a rather useful method to shift blame for social problems to the US Government with just enough truth to it to be plausible. Though, it&#39;s probably untrue given the other embarrassing interventions in the drug trade we know that the CIA was involved in.</p>

<p>For further reading:</p>

<p>There is <em>Cocaine Politics : Drugs, Armies, and the CIA in Central America</em> by one Peter Scott, <em>The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia</em> by Alfred McCoy, and the infamous (but not peer reviewed and not completely accurate) <em>Dark Alliance</em> by Gary Webb.</p>

<p>For a more general understanding of what the CIA has been up to you might want to read <em>The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA</em> by John Ranelagh.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(714)">View full post</button><div id="714" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Argentina endured through six different coup d’etats in the span of the twentieth century. I’ve spoken about the last military dictatorship <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f5t8rn/how_was_state_terrorism_perpetrated_in_argentina/fi11pis/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a>, a brutal dictatorship that disappeared, tortured and murdered over thirty thousand people. As soon as the democratically elected president Estela Martínez de Perón was removed from office, the military junta eliminated the National Constitution and Congress, effectively erasing every single human right and constitutional guarantee in a single, swift action.</p>

<p>Today however, I’d like to talk about the first coup of the century: the 1930 one. On the morning of September 6th, a group of military officers, opposition civil servants and businessmen led by general José Uriburi seized power, removing president Hipólito Yrigoyen from office four years before his term was due to be over. With Uriburu’s self-proclamation as provisional president, came a period of fraudulent presidencies that we’ve come to know as the Infamous Decade. </p>

<p>Uriburu’s government was marked by an attempt to construct a corporatist State framework that would attempt to mitigate the effects of the 1930 global economic crisis, by transferring all political power and policy-making authority to corporations favourable to the ruling oligarchical class, to which Uriburu answered. Their aim? To restore said ruling class to its former glory, to the final decades of the nineteenth century, when the oligarchy led the country by means of electoral fraud, voter suppression and intimidation, in a period known as the 80s Generation. Following the profoundly positivistic and social darwinistic ideological structure of the 80s Generation, the new oligarchy believed firmly in controlling the population through fear and repression, in order to restore what they understood to be the primary bedrock of “order and progress”: a profoundly strict and suffocating social hierarchy through which the popular masses would exist under a constant state of subalternity, ignorance and illiteracy, allowing the ruling elite, the proverbial chosen ones, only people righteous and rational enough to rule, to enrich themselves while commanding every aspect of the political and economical structure of the country. And so, Uriburu started rounding up militants and affiliated members of the Civic Radical Union, Yrigoyen’s party, and incarcerating them, attempting to change the Constitution in the process in order to eliminate the individual, secret and universal suffrage instituted by Law 8871 of 1912, also known as Law Sáenz Peña, and replace it with an electoral system controlled by corporations. However, his corporatist attempt failed, and the economic crisis worsened to the point where he was forced to resign in 1932, even after having suppressed and cancelled several provincial elections.</p>

<p>Even if the corporatist project had failed miserably, the oligarchy hadn’t given up. All through Uriburu’s de facto presidency, they had prepared a new alliance of right wing parties (including a dissenting faction of Yrigoyen’s Radical Civic Union called the Anti-personalist Radical Civic Union), called La Concordancia, The Concordance. Through the following decade, the Concordance ruled the country through fraud and voter suppression, bankrupting Argentina in the process of enriching themselves. Arguably the most notable example of this was the Roca-Runcimann pact, signed during Agustín Justo’s de facto presidency. The treaty secured a minimum export quota of three hundred and ninety thousand tons of frozen meat to the United Kingdom, in exchange for 85% of said meat to be exclusively processed in British-owned frigorifics installed in different parts of Argentina, and also in exchange of Argentina committing to only buying the entirety of its coal requirements directly from Britain. As a result, Argentina developed a long lasting dependency relationship with the UK, which impacted heavily on the country’s ability to industrialize and advance technologically in one of its main productive sectors, husbandry.</p>

<p>I could go on forever about the Infamous Decade, but I’d like to point out one more thing. During the de facto presidency of Robert Ortiz, who ruled from 1938 to 1940, a secret law was issued, Circular N°11, which stated that Argentine consuls ought to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>negar la visa aún a título de turista o pasajero de tránsito a toda persona que fundadamente se considere que abandona o ha abandonado su país de origen como indeseable o expulsado, cualquiera sea el motivo de su expulsión.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning</p>

<blockquote>
<p>deny visas, even if asked for under tourism or passenger in transit to any and all persons who can be considered to have abandoned their country of origin after having been branded as an undesirable or expelled, whichever the reason for said branding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, I seem to remember a certain country that in 1938 was very much into branding certain ethnicities as undesirables, many of whom tried their very best to escape and seek refuge in other, more tolerant countries. But alas, the Infamous Decade was as ideologically fascist as the Nazis. They just didn’t get the chance to enact a genocide on any people. Lucky me I guess, my native ancestors probably wouldn’t have been able to survive <em>two</em> genocides in one generation. My Jewish ancestors barely survived their genocides. Anyhow.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the Infamous Decade was ended abruptly by yet another coup, which deposed de facto president Ramón Castillo and instituted a provisional military government led first by Pedro Ramírez (1943-1944) and then by Edelmiro Farrell (1944-1946). Farrell called for elections to be organized in 1945, the first free, democratic elections since Yrigoyen won in 1928. And along came president Juan Domingo Perón, who had been part of the military coup of 43, and had worked as Secretary of Labour and Social Security, Minister of War and Vice President under Farrell.</p>

<p>Perón was overthrown in 1955, three years before his second presidential term was over. And so another dictatorship came along, which lasted until 1958. And then, democratically elect Frondizi was removed by yet another military coup, led by a civilian this time, José María Guido, in 1962. That one lasted a whole year! And then, barely three years later, yet another democratically elected president, Arturo Illia, was also removed by yet another coup. These officers called themselves the Argentine Revolution, and they created a Statute that was positioned alongside the Constitution in hierarchical legal terms, but in reality effectively replaced the Constitution for all intents and purposes. During this period, the three de facto presidents, Onganía, Levingston and Lanusse, did their very best to erase Perón’s Justicialist Party from the face of the country, persecuting, arresting, torturing and forcing into exile any and all sympathizers of the movement. And yet, this dictatorship was also over eventually. Their authoritarianism became too much for the country to stand. Amidst several armed insurrections by peronist armed organizations, the military was forced to call for elections, in which Héctor Cámpora, a long time ally of Perón, won the presidency. Cámpora then stepped down after his inauguration, calling for new elections in which Perón, newly returned from his exile in Spain, was elected president for a third time, with his third wife, Estela Martínez de Perón, as his Vice President.</p>

<p>And we come full circle. Perón died soon after, in 1974, and his Vice President succeeded him. With a politically neophyte president, perceived as weak and lacking enough charisma to garner the level of support her husband had had, the military and the ruling oligarchy saw yet another opportunity to seize power. See the pattern yet? And so, on March 24th, 1976, Jorge Rafael Videla communicated to the country that the armed forces were now in control of the government. And they remained in control until popular unrest and economic debacle forced them to call for elections in 1983.</p>

<p>So here we are. I was born after democracy had already been restored, but my family lived through it, and survived. My grandfather was kidnapped, tortured and held prisoner by the military in 1977. He bore the marks of the torture by electrocution they inflicted on his body until his death a few weeks ago, and I tell his story with pride. My country lived through more turmoil in less than a century than others live in several generations. And we have survived all of it. We are still standing. </p>

<p>Are there those who would deny the crimes of the dictatorships? Of course. As a historian I face them every day, even here, each and every time I speak about these issues I get attacked by those who would downplay, justify and deny the atrocities committed by de facto governments. But I will continue to share these historical events, because it is my duty to every one of you, and every one of mine. </p>

<p>Where there is power, there is resistance.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(715)">View full post</button><div id="715" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Fascist movements rely on the perception of popularity, the sense of a mass movement determined to sweep away the fragile trappings of liberal democracy, to expose the perceived weakness and lack of determination at the heart of the system. This process is inherently violent – not just towards the political system, but those who support it, defend it and ultimately those who were once protected by it.</p>

<p>Fascist movements succeed not because they are actually strong enough to achieve this, but because they convince those who are strong enough to defend democracy that it is not in their best interests to do so. That they are better allies than enemies, that their supposed popularity and dynamism offers a lifeline to conservative movements becoming keenly aware that the march of history is against them. That their opponents – usually leftist politicians and political movements, but in every case those framed as the true enemies of the nation – are the real threat against which fascist aid and protection is vital. It’s a long con, the goal of which is majority complicity in an ever-escalating cycle of abuse. </p>

<p>Fascist movements don’t succeed when there is a refusal to compromise with them across the political spectrum, when standing and defending democracy is not the task of a demonised minority, and above all when conservatives realise in time that they do not and cannot control the movements whose support seems, in the short-term, to be oh-so-convenient. For those on the left who are cynical that this might be possible, I’d remind them that the largest war in the history of the human race was fought, and won, by an anti-fascist coalition that brought together conservatives, liberals, socialists and many others, who learned just in time to put aside their differences to confront what they correctly recognised to be an existential threat.</p>

<p>History offers explanations, not neat parallels. 1922, 1923, 1933 or 1936, to name a few in my own field of study, do not hold all the answers we need today, or offer a roadmap to a better future. The roots of what we’ve witnessed lie not in Germany, Italy or other European countries that fell to fascism from within, but rather – as argued persuasively above – in America itself. </p>

Gild him!</strong></p>

<p>Fascism is by its nature, by its design a violent movement and so it is no stranger to both coups and other attempts to take political power and political space by violence. Indeed, violence and its public display is an essential ideological feature of fascism as a political ideology.</p>

<p>Unlike the advocates of liberal democracy, it is not reason or modernization, which drives forward and unlike communists, it is not material relationships. For the Fascist the engine of history is conflict, whether between nations, peoples or races. History is a constant struggle in which a community of mythical qualities needs to assert itself in order to gain dominance over others. Dominance is the core goal and must be asserted. And only if the right and rightful people dominate will a golden age begin.</p>

<p>The political utopia of the Fascist differs greatly from liberal or communist visions of utopia: Both of the latter are built on a vision of a utopian future that needs to be built and achieved. The Fascist on the other hand looks to the past for its utopia since most fantasies of dominance are historically justified. Whether it is the return to the Roman Empire or the mythical Lebensraum of German kings, all Fascist utopian visions are built upon a return to a hazy, mythological past in which the world was right. And such a return must by necessity be a violent one, one that engages in the eternal conflict with the supposedly sinister forces that have lead to the lapse and prevent a return.</p>

<p>According to scholar of fascism, Robert Paxton, it is not an ideology like others but understands itself as a political practice more than anything else:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a way unlike the classical &quot;isms&quot;, the rightness of fascism does not depend on the truth of any proposition advanced in its name. Fascism is &quot;true&quot; insofar as it helps fulfill the destiny of a chosen race or people or blood, locked with other peoples in a Darwinian struggle, and not in the light of some abstract universal reason. (...) The truth was whatever permitted the new fascist man (and woman) to dominate others, and whatever made the chosen people triumph.</p>

<p>Fascism rested not upon the truth of its doctrine but upon the leader&#39;s mystical union with historic destiny of his people. (...) The fascist leader wanted to bring his people into a higher realm of politics that they would experience sensually: the warmth of belonging to a race now fully aware of its identity, historic destiny, and power; the excitement of participating in a vast collective enterprise; the gratification of submerging oneself in a wave of shared feelings, and of sacrificing one&#39;s petty concerns for the group&#39;s good; and the thrill of domination. Fascism deliberate replacement of reasoned debate with immediate sensual experience transformed politics, as the exiled cultural critic Walter Benjamin was first to point, into aesthetics. And the ultimate fascist aesthetic experience, Benjamin warned in 1936, was war.</p>

<p>Fascist leaders made no secret of having no program. (...) Fascism radical instrumentalization of truth explains why fascists never bothered to write any casuistical literature when they changed their program as they did often and without compunction. Stalin was forever writing to prove that his policies accorded somehow with the principles of Marx and Lenin; Hitler and Mussolini never bothered with any such theoretical justification.
In the same vein, Paxton goes on to define Fascism as</p>

<p>a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, fascists have always resorted to the use of political violence, including the forceful overthrow of democracies and coup attempts. The Nazis for example were very good at instrumentalizing violence: Instigating street fights with communists as well as with Berlin police in the 1920s for example as a way to demonstrate that they were the most effective force in battling those perceived as the enemy while portraying the democratic state, its government and institutions as weak. </p>

<p>Such displays that both showed the force and strength of a fascist movement – show what they could do and inflict upon the system virtually without impunity was a classical and essential strategy in their rise to power for it portrayed them as strong, established them as a force to be afraid of and portrayed the democracitcinstill terror and fear in their opponents and in the middle class.</p>

<p>However, something akin to what we have seen and continually see today means even more. Above Paxton mentions Benjamin and war as the ultimate aestehtic experience of fascism. By aesthetics Benajmin means to describe how politics is transformed into something resembling art, often putting immediate sensual experience over concrete content. Like viewing a Rembrandt or a Caravaggio, what is actually depicted becomes secondary over the experience of the beauty with which the motif is depicted.
Fascist politics share this trait by placing a larger emphasis on the ritual – masses, marches, book burnings, collective gatherings – rather than what is actually transported politically. For Nazis, it was not so much what Hitler said at some speech, it was how he said it – how he spoke, gesticulated, screamed – and how they experienced it – as part of a large crowd in a stadium, all acting in unison when screaming &quot;Heil&quot;, wearing similar uniforms, marching in order etc. It is the experience of becoming part of a mass acting in a unified will; a community led by a single purpose; an intense feeling of belonging and becoming cog in a large machine of people that acts towards the ultimate goal of whatever you imagine deliverance to be.</p>

<p>In essence, it is swaying people to your political side not by argument or reason but giving them the intensive, almost lustful, experience of being part of something greater, a movement that will solve whatever ails them, of history, so to speak. And this is achieved through ritual, staging, and performance. Fascist mass politics do not rely on content or arguments but on this very performance and war – according to Benjamin – is portrayed and staged as the ultimate experience of all the above described feelings.</p>

<p>By displays of violence, Fascism seeks to transform politics from the – admittedly often skewed – exchange of ideas into an aesthetic experience itself: Aesthetic violence is the end point of fascist politics, not just its tool.</p>

<p>In order to understand what we have seen and continue to see today, it is imperative to understand that violence such as this is designed to serve Fascism in several ways: It disrupts democratic process and literally prevents the system from functioning; it helps portray the democratic state as ineffective and weak; it is designed to instill fear and terror in the hearts and minds of political opponents and the general populace; and it serves the deeply ingrained ideological need of fascists to engage in aesthe    ticized violence with such violence being designed to further fantasies of civil war, civic breakdown and – as Adolf Hitler wished it in 1945 – a Ragnarök like event of the world burning. This is what events like those today are designed for.</p>

<p>Lastly I’ll leave you with what Robert Paxton writes about Fascism and America:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States itself has never been exempt from fascism. (...) Much more dangerous [than movements like the American Nazi Party, which utilize already established tenants and creeds from Europe] are movements that employ authentically American themes in ways that resemble fascism functionally. The Klan revived in the 1920s, took on virulent anti-Semitism, and spread to the cities of the Middle West. In the 1930s, Father Charles E. Coughlin gathered a radio audience estimated at forty million around anti-communist, anti-Wall Street, pro-soft money, and – after 1938 – anti-Semtic message broadcast from his church in the outskirts of Detroit. (...) Today a &quot;politics of resentment&quot; rooted in authentic American piety and nativism sometimes leads to violence against some of the very same &quot;internal enemies&quot; once targeted by the Nazis, such as homosexuals and defenders of abortion rights.</p>

<p>Of course the United States would have to suffer catastrophic setbacks and polarization for these fringe groups to find powerful allies and enter the mainstream. I half expected to see emergence after 1968 a movement of national reunification, regeneration, and purification directed against hirsute antiwar protesters, black radicals, and &quot;degenerate&quot; artists. I thought that some of the Vietnam veterans might form analogs to the Freikorps of 1919 Germany and Itlaian Arditi, and attack youths whose demonstrations on the steps of the Pentagon had &quot;stabbed them in the back&quot;. Fortunately, I was wrong (so far). (...)</p>

<p>The language and symbols of an authentic American fascism would, of course, have little to do with the original European models. They would have to be familiar and reassuring to loyal Americans as the language and symbols of the original fascism were familiar and reassuring to many Italians and Germans. (...) No swastikas in an American fascism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian corsses. No fascist salute, but mass recitation of the pledge of allegiance. These symbols contain no whiff of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the internal enemy.&quot;</p>
