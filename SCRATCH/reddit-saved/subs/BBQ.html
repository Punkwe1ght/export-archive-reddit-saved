<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What would you consider essential gear to get started? I plan on getting a kettle grill, obviously some charcoal, a sharp knife, and metal bowl for the water pan. What are the accessories that you would need? (I&#39;m thinking strong tongs/glove and a decent thermometer, for example). I&#39;m starting from scratch.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you see beef ribs with no meat on top those are usually the ribs from the loin (like
When they cut ribeyes). Those ribs only have meat in between the bones and even that is pretty gristley in many cases. Stay away from those. </p>

<p>What you are looking for are beef plate ribs as shown above (3 bones) or beef chuck ribs (4 bones). These are both commonly and interchangeably referred to As short ribs. Just ask for the whole plate or rack Of Untrimmed short ribs and any butcher will know what you mean. These are the beef ribs with all the meat on top. Brisket on a stick. </p>

<p>Btw- beautiful shorties OP! Making
Me jealous. </p>
