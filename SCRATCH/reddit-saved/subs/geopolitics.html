<p>--This is what the Japanese mean by &quot;understanding the gravity of this moment&quot;:</p>

<p>Although everyone in the west right now is drunk on the supposed superiority of our weapons systems in the operational context of Ukraine, the fact of the matter is that after 20 years of Iraq/Afghanistan and the concurrent erosion of the west economic base (i.e. it&#39;s middle class), no one in Beijing/Russia/etc is really deterred by Washington/NATO military ability. Not to the extent they were in the 90s. </p>

<p>While the US has managed to maintain it&#39;s share of the global economy constant at around 25%, the Power balance has shifted dramatically for the rest of the global pie, with the EU being the biggest loser to China. <a href="https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-has-shrunk-percentage-world-economy/">Going from a 30% share of the global economy in 1980 to 15% in 2015.</a> China in the meantime <a href="https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/270439/chinas-share-of-global-gross-domestic-product-gdp.jpg">went from 2% to 18%</a>. One can arguably add Russia to the EU on the losing side of this power shift. This kind of major economic power shift seldom happened in the history of mankind. But one thing is certain:  the consequence are huge power vacuums in both geographical and economic areas where Europe was historically dominant: Geographically, huge swathes of centra Asia and Africa are up for grabs, while economically innovation in Europe is slowly but surely dying. China/India/Gulf countries saw the writing on the wall and are setting in motion their pawns on the board.</p>

<p>Re-arming in this context is the only option for regional powers whose economic outcomes are tied to the fate of these areas where Europe is retreating. Unless Europe gets their s**t together and fix the EU economic system in the near future, the continent&#39;s future prosperity isn&#39;t as clear an outcome as the pundits on certain subreddits/popular media would like you to believe. Right now the Game of Nations is in full steam, and we are losing it.</p>

<p>TL:DR : Europe (a non negligible portion of <em>the west</em>, plus <em>Russia</em>) is fading away, creating a huge power vacum in certain geographical areas. Ukraine was a flashpoint of this power shift. As a result most regional powers that traditionally operate in these historically European-dominated areas (in this case central/eastern Asia) have no other choice but to massively rearm in the face of the now very apparent power vacum.</p>
