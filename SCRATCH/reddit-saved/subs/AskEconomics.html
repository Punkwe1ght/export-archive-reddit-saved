<h2>How does shorting stock benefit the economy?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(186)">View full post</button><div id="186" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading the book Fault Lines by Raghuram Rajan, and in Ch6 when talking about shorting stocks he says the following:</p>

<p>&quot;Few people are more vilified than short sellers, who are seen as vultures feasting on the misfortune of others. But they perform a valuable social function by depriving poorly managed companies of resources. A company whose stock price tanks will not be able to raise equity or debt finance easily and could be forced to close down.&quot;</p>

<p>He goes on later to criticize short sellers later, but seems to be acknowledging some benefit to their behavior.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m not getting is how the short sellers deprive said companies of resources. It seems like he&#39;s saying the lowering of the stock price is what causes lenders to lose confidence, but how do short sellers contribute to that?</p>

<h2>Is capitalism “real”?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/TheHistoriansCraft </span><span class = "numcomments">93 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/w65skf/is_capitalism_real/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(191)">View full post</button><div id="191" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From a historical perspective is capitalism “real”?</p>

<p>In an economics course I took a few years ago, one of the things talked about was that many economists, and some economic historians, have largely ditched terms like “socialism”, “communism”, “capitalism”, etc because they are seen as imprecise. What was also discussed was that the idea of distinct modes of production are now largely seen as incorrect. Economies are mixed, and they always have been. </p>

<p>I know about medievalists largely abandoning the term “feudalism”, for example. So from a historical &amp; economic perspective, does what we consider to be “capitalism” actually exist, or is that the economy  has simply grown more complex? Or does it only make sense in a Marxian context?</p>

<p>I’m not an economic historian by training so I’m really rather curious about this</p>

<h2>What do economists say about capitalism and socialism?</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Potassium_15 </span><span class = "numcomments">13 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/q8yen7/what_do_economists_say_about_capitalism_and/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(192)">View full post</button><div id="192" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, I come from a conservative family that loves capitalism. A lot of the economics I learned in school and from books (like Naked Economics) gave me the impression that economists agree: capitalism is good for the economy, socialism is bad. (I also understand that there is a spectrum, and it&#39;s possible to have elements of both in an economy). </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m going to school in California, and everyone here HATES capitalism. No one says that they are socialist, but in class discussions people express socialist ideas. I can certainly understand why people are so frustrated with capitalism (extreme inequality, externalities, etc.) but I&#39;m having a hard time completely rejecting the idea of capitalism. I was taught that market economies have weaknesses, but that&#39;s where the government should step in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to spark a big debate with this question. Neither my parents nor my classmates are economists, and I just wanted to get an economist&#39;s perspective. What are the economic facts that everyone agrees on? I know this is a big topic so I would love suggestions for books/ documentaries/ podcasts that might help me learn more.</p>

<h2>Could somebody recommend me a book on the same topics Nassim Taleb discusses (planning and risk analysis under uncertainty), but by somebody who isn't a bloviator?</h2>

<p>Nassim Taleb may know his stuff, but his style puts me off. It&#39;s not quite to the point enough, and it&#39;s too &quot;everybody is an idiot except for me&quot;</p>
