<h2>Why you should build your free FOB and other quality of life tips (story spoiler free)</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>FOB stuff:</p>

<p>But OP, they&#39;ll steal my guys/resources!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They can only steal your resources if you build a platform that has containers on it.  For example the command platform has 0 containers on it, so they can&#39;t steal any resources (they will still get some for a successful mission, but that just seems to be a small bonus to encourage players who don&#39;t need troops and to help offset deployment costs).   Further I stole 8 containers from someone and got, at most, 1500 ish per resource (NOT PER CONTAINER).   In short, the losses resource wise are extremely negligible.  I think only the base development and support platform have containers on the main piece, and any upgraded platform will have containers  on it&#39;s other parts, but if you don&#39;t build/upgrade those they can&#39;t seem to touch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Any troops you really want to keep you can keep on base (select them in the staff menu and hit x/square).  Frankly though the only troops I&#39;ve ever had stolen were easily replaceable A&#39;s-D&#39;s (more on that later).</p></li>
<li><p>From what i&#39;ve read rewards scale with security.  If you just build the single command FOB with minimal security they&#39;ll get next to nothing for stealing from you.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#39;ve been stolen from you cannot be invaded again for 24 hours UNLESS YOU INVADE SOMEONE ELSE. </p></li>
<li><p>It appears that you lose a LOT of GMP if you fail to defend your base, so just ignore the warning if it comes up (this needs confirmation though).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So if you just build the tutorial command platform you get slightly higher troop totals and the ability to double your dispatch missions which will EASILY outpace your extremely small losses (a single dispatch can net you more than several failed infiltrations). Every invasion that i&#39;ve had except for one was retaliatory.</p>

<p>Single player stuff:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop worrying about your troops.  There are literally tons of the bastards littered all over and you&#39;re always going to need more.  There&#39;s a &quot;waiting room&quot; which in my game currently has 300 backup troops just sitting in it and i&#39;m not done upgrading either my main base or FOB.  I see so many posts about trying to make the perfect army or upset that maybe someone will steal a few troops.  S-S++ troops are actually rare.  Everything else is common as sin by the end game (and i&#39;m not even done.).   Almost every troop I fulton at this point has at LEAST an A+ in one stat or better and i&#39;ve still got guys who are active duty with B&#39;s or worse.   For the record I&#39;ve been doing sideops with the &quot;fulton everything&quot; approach to every single area i&#39;ve gone too and frequently have 60+ men in the brig, so that should give you an idea of just how badly I STILL need troops.  I&#39;ll also add that should you hit the troop cap (i still haven&#39;t) it&#39;ll autofire your weakest members, so you don&#39;t need to manually go through and dismiss all the E&#39;s. They&#39;ll get shuffled to the waiting room and eventually dismissed when it&#39;s appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone else posted this, but hit the back button when in free roam and select &quot;return to ACC&quot; to get back to the gunship quickly.  Further as you develop your heli it gets more and more expensive to call it, even if it&#39;s just to pick you up.  Bothering to micro the helicopters items to keep extraction costs cheap is pointless, so just use the menu as it appears to be totally free.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the legendary gunsmith. There&#39;s topics all over the subreddit on this so i&#39;ll bring up the main points.  A. You need to do at LEAST the &quot;get the stun arm blueprint&quot; and &quot;legendary bear&quot; side ops.  B. You can get him after mission 13.  C. THERE ARE 3 SEPARATE SIDE OPS YOU MUST COMPLETE TO GET HIM.  If you don&#39;t have him yet but thought you did the mission, check the sideop list.  Once you&#39;ve got him go to customize and weapons should be at the top.  </p></li>
<li><p>Focus on a few key weapons first.  Upgrades start cheap but climb quickly in price.  Figure out what your main loadout is going to be + your FOB security forces if you care, and then research that stuff.  Of note since everyone wants a silenced tranq sniper, you can research the unsilenced one, get the gunsmith, and then just throw a silencer on it in the customize menu.  This is MUCH faster and cheaper.  In the later game I&#39;d highly recommend all the fulton upgrades</p></li>
<li><p>Using quiets attacks to cause distractions doesn&#39;t count as an alert during story mission (i think....small chance i&#39;m wrong as it&#39;s been awhile since i&#39;ve bothered to use her).</p></li>
<li><p>You are not graded during side ops.  Do what you gotta do.</p></li>
<li><p>D horse is ironically a lot better once you get to later area&#39;s which have more open space, but even still almost every base has a path around it that you can ride dhorse at full speed past (still the worst buddy though).</p></li>
<li><p>Try to have about 100-200k before any mission later in the game as a safety buffer.  I&#39;ve gone into the red a few times and never lost anyone, but it&#39;s worth playing it safe, especially if you come across a lot of crates/vehicles you want.</p></li>
<li><p>You can sell resources to make more money.  Figure out what you need to do any important research + a good buff for using that tech (you can see how much of each resource you&#39;re going to use on the loadout screen) and then sell the extra.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t care about FOB missions then you absolutely should be extracting weapon emplacements (which frankly seem to do nothing in FOB outside of mortars).  Every single one sells at a good profit.  Granted don&#39;t go out of your way for it, but if you&#39;ve cleared the area or no one is around there&#39;s no sense leaving free money lying around.  Animals technically extract at a profit as well, but it&#39;s only 200 per animal, which is literally chump change.</p></li>
