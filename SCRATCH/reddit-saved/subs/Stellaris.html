<div class="md"><p>Mods have made a huge difference for me, too.</p>

<p>I hit the point where I was adding so many mods that a lot of them started conflicting, and I spent most of the day on Sunday figuring out how the files work for the mods and merging things.  It resulted in a collection of things that seems to have dramatically opened up my options and the complexities of the game, and while some of it might be a bit OP, it has also made the game a lot more fun, rich, and broad.</p>

<p>At this point I have my personal merge of a bunch of mods:</p>

<ul>

<p>Then a handful of things that help with the UI, or other cosmetic things (or galaxy sizes) that don&#39;t otherwise really impact gameplay:</p>

<li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684450485">UI Overhaul 1440p</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a handful of namelists, emblems, a better emblem color picker, races, and things like that as well, but they&#39;re all purely cosmetic.  That, and the Mass Effect soundtrack mod, although I&#39;ve had the music turned off and just listend to my own music lately.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure some of the things I haven&#39;t merged yet (like New Ship Classes &amp; More and Advanced Fleet Operations) probably also have conflicts, but I&#39;ll get to them later.</p>

<h2>My mod recommendations for those who wish to enhance but not alter the base Stellaris experience.</h2>

<div id="51qi2l" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here is my personal list of a set of mods and description that I have been experimenting with, and found they go particularly well together to enhance the base game experience without totally converting the game or deviating from it. All these mods are compatible with each other and each tweaks one or two things to build a nice ensemble together. Not all of them have been updated with the 1.2.5 marker, however I have had no issues running them in-game. Naturally, I&#39;ve provided the links to the appropriate workshop pages:</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697938908"><strong>Beautiful Universe v2.0</strong></a>
Beautiful Universe builds on its predecessor by making changes to solar system and universal backgrounds to create a more authentic space nebula backdrop <em>a la</em> Eve Online.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701739734"><strong>Color coded pop status icons</strong></a>
This tiny understated mod does just one thing, it changes that orange triangle for 4 versions based on populaton status, giving you an at-a-glance indication of what the problem is.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688576380"><strong>Complete Colors</strong></a>
This rather brilliant mod adds a full RGB color picker to the faction colors screen, giving greater color variety for your faction symbol and borders, and it lets the AI use it too. This can occasionally result in overly-bold primary colors filling space, which is why the next mod is:</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695602001"><strong>Subdued Borders</strong></a>
This mod alters Stellaris&#39; base border style to an opaque outer line and semi-transparent interior fill like Civilization V. This allows factions to pick bold colors without looking garish or obscuring vital in-game text. This truly complements Complete Colors and the AI makes some surprisingly great combinations.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682165224"><strong>Flags: Emblems and Backgrounds</strong></a>
This mod complements the variety provided by Complete Colors by adding new Emblems, new Background patterns, and also adding Onyx color emblems, further enhancing faction flag variety. The AI can use them too, giving you nice surprise now and then when you encounter them in-game.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682835797"><strong>Galaxies Unlimited 1.1.0</strong></a>
This modifies Galaxy generation to allow for larger and more densely populated galaxies, up to a limit of 5000 stars and 99 civilizations. There are other mods that do this, but I&#39;ve found this particular one is polished and very compatible with other mods that alter galaxy formation. It also adjusts the star dispersion along spirals, giving a more natural looking spiral galaxy. This works great with:</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683236144"><strong>Galaxy Centers</strong></a>
This mod only does two things, but it vastly improves the map. The center of the galaxy is now populated with stars, and the brightness is reduced. This is for those of you who like the idea of fighting your way across the center, rather than traveling around it.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717706829"><strong>Realistic Stars</strong></a>
A greatly practical mod, this changes the render sizes of particular classes of stars so that they are more approximate to what their real-world scale is, so that red dwarfs are small, Type G stars are medium, and supergiant Type Bs are truly dominant. Quantum anomalies are larger. It also increases the number of red dwarfs relative to the others, to more closely match real star populations. The Galaxy Map looks much better imo. I&#39;ve come to appreciate this mod very much.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719221893"><strong>Realistic Star Colors</strong></a>
A mod that complements Realistic Stars that modifies star rendering by altering what appears to be a self-light, white gradient and hue/saturation. The effect is rather better on in-system views. Credit to <a href="/u/bipedalshark">/u/bipedalshark</a> for pointing me to it.</p>

<p>Please try them out for yourselves, singly or all at once. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this combination.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting to the stage where I understand most core gameplay features (aka big flashy features you need to do most things) but the nuances between Empire builds (race/civics) that interplay with Ascension paths is where I&#39;m getting stuck and a bit lost as there&#39;s so much to factor in. (not to mention the faction system and how to milk that for as much influence as possible - mainly around promoting good factions without active interference influence penalties  -but that&#39;s a whole other discussion)</p>

<p>So far I&#39;ve gone the militarist/xenophile (custom Human) playing super wide and locking out many empires from vast sections of the galaxy using the bottlenecks and careful spending of my influence - I get piracy but I also have uncontested scores of systems to gobble up at will. </p>

<p>Traditions gained so far: Tech Ascend, Interstellar Dom and Mind of Matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering - I&#39;d love people to post their full Tradition path and give it context for their race to describe their strategy. I&#39;m finding it hard to find good info on people&#39;s detailed strategies rather than playing 30 inefficient campaigns to understand some subtle but important concepts that are never shown until you know where to look. (I find this game does that a lot - but I love it anyway!)</p>

<h2>Guide to Going Tall</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/ituralde_ </span>
<span class = "numcomments">91 comments </span>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/6guwng/guide_to_going_tall/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('6guwng')">View full post</button>
<div id="6guwng" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Everyone.  </p>

<p>Everyone is familiar with that playstyle of mass expansion and conquest.  You grow faster than everyone else, take all their shit, and salvage all the tech you don&#39;t have.  You bury the enemy under the weight of raw production and minerals and bam, you own the galaxy.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much the most effective way to play this game.  </p>

<p>What if you want something different? Well, what I&#39;m looking to introduce here is another way of approaching the game. It&#39;s strictly less competitive, but fun in its own right, and I think i&#39;ve pretty thoroughly nailed how to do it well enough such that you don&#39;t fall behind the curve and get eaten by large expansionist AIs, Fallen Empires, or Crisis Events.  </p>

<p>In my test playthrough, I managed to win a simultaneous War In Heaven and a Prethoryn Invasion that expanded to my border - so it does work.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>First things first, let&#39;s talk definitions - I describe &#39;going tall&#39; in Stellaris as simply restricting oneself to never having sectors.  The goal is to get an edge in tech and fill out systems with Habitats and Megastructures later on to make you competitive.  </p>

<p>So let&#39;s design a faction with that in mind. </p>

<p>These days, I like to start by thinking about what ascension path I want to roll with.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Psionic</strong> is largely garbage for this.  You won&#39;t be that big, so a lot of the ethics attraction stuff you get from Spiritualist doesn&#39;t help you any. Furthermore, given your need for tech, being Materialist is ideal here.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthetic</strong> is the seemingly obvious choice.  It plays well with Materialistic factions, and it gives you an early way to have mineral-bonused populations as your empire grows, allowing your main racial pop to focus on your research needs.  You also effectively double your population growth rate early on, which gives you a bit of a headstart.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biological</strong> is fully viable, and gets you extra value out of your otherwise lower value Society research while you are waiting to build up to megastructure capability.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The choice between going Biological and Synthetic is one that should effect your Trait choices - if you are going Synthetic, you&#39;ll probably want to lean towards strict science-based traits, where with Biological you may want to consider addressing your inevitable mineral hunger in your trait picks.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting you get a couple easy negative traits for free.  <strong>Nonadaptive</strong> basically doesn&#39;t hurt you - you won&#39;t be proactively colonizing worlds outside your main planet group ever; you&#39;ll have the tech to terraform what you need later on. <strong>Sedentary</strong> is another largely free one.  </p>

<p>For Ethics, you should go for <strong>Fanatic Materialist</strong> and <strong>Pacifist</strong>.  You need Tech and Unity, so these are the obvious choices.  Furthermore, you specifically want industrial tech early and often; being Pacifist means you don&#39;t roll annoying military techs when you could be researching techs that matter.  </p>

<p>The other thing you want from being a pacifist is <strong>Agrarian Idyll</strong>.  Why? Because Unity is the most important thing - you have to get through an Ascension Path and have a bunch of Unity slots for Megastructures, so you need that shit early and often.  You will most likely switch off it later, but by then most of your pops will be eating out of Paradise Domes and/or be robots.  </p>

<p>For tech, the jump type doesn&#39;t matter that much, but you really want Energy Weapons, as you don&#39;t want to be wasting valuable Engineering research on weapons when you need to be getting Fortress, Battleship and Megastructure techs out of that slot on top of your minerals industry.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>So, let&#39;s talk gameplay.  </p>

<p>You start the game playing essentially the same way you would a wide faction - you want to colonize aggressively to carve out a healthy corner of space.  Be cognizant, however, of what planets you choose to colonize - you want ones that buy you a fair chunk of space and are sizeable themselves.  Start with the <strong>Expansion</strong> tree and jump-start your empire.  </p>

<p>When you colonize a planet, the first thing you should always build is an Authocthon Monument.  Why? Pops can eat later but you need Unity now.  </p>

<p>In the long run, all of your planets will want to lean towards mineral optimization. Mineral mining is the one thing that doesn&#39;t work that well on Habitats, so take advantage of surface locations where you can get the most out of your advanced mines.  Getting in a few mineral silos won&#39;t hurt you either, as you are often going to want to bank a fair bit of minerals while you are waiting on megastructure timers.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about colonizing every single planet slot you have available to you - if you want to save 1-2 for a juicy large world you will terraform later, feel free.  </p>

<p>Remember, you&#39;ll finish the Expansion tree quickly, so use those Frontier Outposts to lock down space you&#39;ll want later.  You&#39;ll need tons of Influence later on, but for now,  the lebensbraum is more important. </p>

<p>Get starbases on your planets early; that makes the AI think you aren&#39;t a juicy target and will keep you out of the recieving end of a bunch of unpleasant early game wars that will get in the way of progress.  </p>

<p>Once you finish Expansion, you probably want Harmony or Discovery.  I personally lean towards Harmony, because you really want to get the most out of your pops.  Your first Ascension perk? You&#39;re going tall! Get <strong>Technological Ascendancy</strong>.  </p>

<p>From there, you want to build towards your Ascension Path of choice, which you should likely finish before being able to get <strong>Voidborne</strong>.  You want <strong>Voidborne</strong> at the earliest opportunity, as it&#39;s going to let you fill out your systems, but the battleship tech requirement is pretty steep and you may not be lucky enough to roll it.  </p>

<p>That said, don&#39;t be rushing for those techs ahead of your industry techs.  Those are the most important; a Voidcraft scientist later can get you your ship class techs fairly reliably.  </p>

<p>Your next Tradition tree after Discover and Harmony will be Prosperity -&gt; Supremacy -&gt; Diplomacy -&gt; Domination.  </p>

<p>Since you&#39;ll be making Unity like it&#39;s going out of style, you shouldn&#39;t need to do a bunch of Fleet production before you start the Prosperity tree.  Unlike expansionist fleets, you want to lean towards having larger ship classes rather than spamming corvettes.  They aren&#39;t strictly as resource efficient, but you won&#39;t have as many planets fueling your industry so you really want a robust force that will take minimal attrition in fights.  </p>

<p>In the midgame, from a strict min/max perspective, you may want to be looking to launch proactive liberation wars to humiliate rivals for the unity and to bite chunks off of neighboring growing empires.  However, if you simply have a bit of a fleet in being, that will often deter the AIs enough that you&#39;ll keep out of wars you don&#39;t want to be involved in.  </p>

<p>Whatever you do, avoid pesky bullshit like Federations.  That will divert your attention away from building your own things and into wars you don&#39;t want to be fighting.  </p>

<p>The big danger moment is when it&#39;s time to build Habitats en masse.  You&#39;ll be dumping most of your Empire&#39;s minerals into this effort as you want to saturate all of your core systems with Habitats.  If you&#39;ve chosen your core systems well, this should get you to ~25-35 Habitats on 7-8 Core Sector Systems.  </p>

<p>Habitats are most valuable for their research.  They do Power pretty well too, but you&#39;ll have Dyson Spheres for that shit later; the big thing you want is to convert your un-resourced planet slots almost uniquely to mineral generation and fill in the research gap on your Habitats.  Don&#39;t be afraid to have a couple mineral mines on them as well; they aren&#39;t strictly optimal, but it&#39;s a source of minerals you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.  The habitats are only the beginning of your expenses, so don&#39;t be shy about using them to bolster your mineral production.  </p>

<p>You do want a Paradise Dome and a Leisure Hub on every single one.  The influence is important, but most of all, the Happiness is what makes them competitive as you don&#39;t get your planetside synergy bonuses from things like Power Hubs and Mineral Processing Plants.  </p>

<p>Somewhere in here, you should be finishing your Ascension of choice.  </p>

<p>If you chose Synthetic, don&#39;t forget to scrap your farms and turn them into more mineral production.  Leave your Paradise Domes; the Happiness and Influence is worth it. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve chosen Biological, keep in mind that you&#39;ll want to plan around having enough Mineral production to keep being competitive.  You can stack this fairly effectively by choosing Very Strong, Industrious, and Conservationist - I&#39;d strongly recommend all 3.  </p>

<p>Soon enough, you&#39;ll be faced with your first megastructure project.  </p>

<p>Whatever you do, don&#39;t get Ringworlds before you get Galactic Wonders; Ringworlds are a dirty trap that increase your system count and won&#39;t be worth your while until later on.  The megastructures you care about are Dyson Spheres and Science Nexuses.  </p>

<p>In an ideal world, your first megastructure is a Dyson Sphere.  This is important, because while the game tooltip says it produces 500 energy/month, you know better and are aware it really means 250 minerals/month since you&#39;ve got a friend at some trading enclave.  You&#39;ve met that trading enclave, incidentally, because unlike your conquesting styles of other playthroughs, everyone in the galaxy that matters likes you enough that you&#39;ve been able to explore and find them.  </p>

<p>However, it&#39;s worth noting that Dyson Spheres are incredibly and absurdly expensive.  If you haven&#39;t saturated your Habitats yet, you probably want to get a Science Nexus first, as you don&#39;t want to shut down your Habitat expansion to feed your entire economy to a Dyson Sphere.  </p>

<p>If you are finding yourself low on Influence, proactively engage in unfair wars using Humiliate.  It only takes 10% warscore, making the war really quick, and it gives you a full Habitat worth of Influence.  </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I was able to field ~300k Fleet power on ~10 systems, ~35 habitats, and a single Dyson Sphere.  Building more Dyson Spheres would naturally increase that, but more than one isn&#39;t absolutely necessary to make you competitive.  </p>

<p>The key to keeping that fleet size is, again, to not lose many ships.   It&#39;s best to go almost entirely Battleships and to load up on Tachyon Lances. If you can smash the enemy Battleship line, that will be most of the non-Fallen Empire firepower capable of bursting through your Battleships.  With high amounts of Armor Penetration, you&#39;ll punch well above your weight class against pretty much any opponent that matters.  </p>

<p>If you get the spare research, keep Kinetic Artillery in reserve.  You&#39;ll want it if you have to fight the Unbidden.  Else, Tachyon Lances and Plasma should serve you well; feel free to dump research into Energy weapon repeatables and save your Engineering research for Armor/Hull/Mineral Production.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>To actually win the game, there are a few routes.  The easiest is to win the War In Heaven as the leader of the League of Unaligned Powers - this pretty much gives you a Federation victory.  Else, you can build a Federation of your own, or ditch Pacifism and do it the old fashioned way.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Hope any of this was helpful to anyone looking to try out another playstyle.  I thought it was a ton of fun, and it was satisfying to have a ~10 system empire that could take on big vast empires that owned 1/4 of the galaxy and win easily.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest take away from my last thread: research / alloy / consumer goods jobs cost about <strong>10 minerals per month</strong> to your economy. That means you should prepare your economy by getting your minerals about +50/month <em>above</em> where you want them before you add 5 more specialized jobs.</li>
<li>At the start of games, clear way the slum tile blocker on your homeworld for a quick extra pop.</li>
<li>Nutritional Plenitude (a food policy choice) is excellent for almost the entire game. I like to activate it a few years into the game, immediately after I settle my first Agri-world, and encourage growth on my homeworld for the first time (after first 1k food.)</li>
<li>The general consensus among min/maxers is that the best opening Tradition tree is Expansion. You&#39;ll want to pick up the &quot;+10% growth&quot; perk as soon as possible. I usually get it third (starting with the cheaper star station costs.)</li>
<li>Another (strangely specific) point of consensus is that you should go down the Prosperity tree <em>third</em>. This gives you some leeway to get creative. Strong aggro builds go: Expansion -&gt; Supremacy -&gt; Prosperity. More science oriented builds go Expansion -&gt; Discovery -&gt; Prosperity. If you want to keep your leaders around, or are playing pacifistic, Expansion -&gt; Harmony -&gt; Prosperity isn&#39;t too bad.</li>
<li>Although it may seem like you can&#39;t directly manage where your pops work, you definitely can: decrease the priority of your pop jobs until your pops decide to work in the desired place. Pops only pick new jobs on creation, unemployment, resettlement, and by forced ousting / preference from priority management. EDIT: Pops can move into new jobs as you re-raise priorities, thus messing up your forced plan for them. You can still mostly get what you want, though.</li>
<li>Avoid increasing your pop living standards until mid-late game. Consumer goods are hard to produce efficiently early in the game, and you&#39;ll want to avoid needing to do so over better choices.</li>
<li>You&#39;ll want to spam out &quot;Encourage Growth&quot; non-stop on all of your worlds until you hit the desired size (this is almost never on city worlds, but more on this later.)</li>
<li>Some jobs aren&#39;t very good, and it&#39;s best to permanently decrease their priority if you can. A great example is Enforcer pops on worlds with a Righteous governor -- you&#39;ll be able to squeeze out just that much more efficiency by turning their priority down just before adding more specialist jobs.</li>
<li>There&#39;s no leader cap in Stellaris anymore. Feel free to spam out a bunch of early scientists, and hand-pick your scientists to roll the right techs, or give you extra % on your current ones.</li>
<li>Unless you want to exploit the market (I avoid exploits like the plague), you should only use the market for (basically) two reasons:

<ul>
<li>To fill a temporary hole in your economy while the relevant permanent fix applies (e.g. producing more minerals by swapping out energy districts for mining ones, or producing more consumer goods to match the amount you&#39;re borrowing, etc.)</li>
<li>Once you hit one resource cap, and could really use a boost to another resource (For example: 10k max minerals with +100 minerals / month -&gt; sell 200 minerals a month until you drop down to 5k minerals, then cancel the trade.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the first market use condition, consider getting yourself out of your economic trade deal your short-term goal. This is because, on the whole, (non-exploitative) market use is disadvantageous compared to local production. E.g. If you could turn +20 energy into +20 minerals by swapping some districts around, the market will charge you +40 energy for the same +20 minerals (the numbers aren&#39;t exact, but you get the idea.)</li>
<li>The <strong>best</strong> early game techs are the ones that unlock the &quot;+15% resource&quot; buildings -- as these are some of the only buildings with no downsides on your Rural worlds. After that, the next best thing to grab is pop growth techs / buildings.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, <strong>mineral production</strong> is super important, while <strong>stored minerals</strong> aren&#39;t terribly important. This is because there&#39;s only so much to spend stored minerals on, while mineral production is the standard by which you can industrialize your economy by producing more consumer goods / research / alloys.</li>
<li>Resettle pops to your new worlds to speed them straight to 10 pops. This is good for kick-starting worlds, and it&#39;s also great for slowing down your older Rural world growth, as they&#39;ll start to hit overcrowding early if you don&#39;t.</li>
<li>It&#39;s easy to forget to grow your territory with construction ships -- but unless you&#39;re gearing up for war, you should occasionally check back and do this. I personally find that it&#39;s best to have 2-3 Construction ships positioned near the various borders you plan on growing out from. This means that on any one check-in with your construction ships, you can give 2-3 expansion orders instead of just 1-2.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, NEVER upgrade your ships in 2.2. For some reason, the upgrade cost is ludicrously high right now, sometimes higher than just producing new ships. Just keep adding fresh ships to old fleets and let battle attrition away your old designs.---</li>
</ul>

<h1>Planets:</h1>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The best way to think about planets (that I&#39;ve found) works like this:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There&#39;s two basic types of planets you&#39;ll settle: <strong>Rural</strong> planets and <strong>City</strong> planets.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Your City planets are going to draw a ton of resources from your Rural planets, so you&#39;ll want to aim for a ratio of about 2 Rural : 1 City. It&#39;s also important to have about 3 City planets by about 2300, so this means you should aim for at least 9 planets by 2300.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>You design Rural planets to maximize raw resource extraction -- so they&#39;re best on planets with a lot of resource districts (at least as many as the size of the planet). City Planets are best on large planets (size 18+), as this will give you the city districts you&#39;ll need to develop the planet past the point where you have more than enough pops for all the worker jobs on that world.</p>

<p>This means there&#39;s basically two orthogonal considerations on Rural vs. City planets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Increasing size: better for City planets.</li>
<li>As many or more resource districts than the planet size: better for Rural planets.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that occasionally, you&#39;ll find a size 20+ world that is actually better as a Rural planet than a City one.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Now, Rural planets and City planets both diversify into a number of different kinds of archetype worlds:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Rural Planets:</h1>

<p>There&#39;s generally two things to think about Rural Planets:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>A. Where are all the resource districts concentrated?</p>

<p>B. Is it a big planet?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s consider A. first:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I like to label my planets (by putting the tag in front of their names) as follows:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;Agri&quot; : Food / Mineral districts only. This means food districts + mineral districts is greater than or equal to planet size.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;Gen&quot; : Energy / Mineral districts only. This means energy districts + mineral districts is greater than or equal to planet size.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;Rural&quot; : The &quot;everything goes&quot; hybrid / generic rural planet. This means neither &quot;Agri&quot; nor &quot;Gen&quot; applies, almost always because there&#39;s not enough mineral districts on the planet for either sub-categorization condition to obtain. &quot;Rural&quot; planets are almost always, therefore, running all three kinds of districts.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Generally, the first three districts on &quot;Agri&quot; / &quot;Gen&quot; worlds depend on what I need in the short-term. Long-term, however, you should maximize mineral districts on these worlds. &quot;Rural&quot; worlds alone can afford to run fewer than max mineral districts: e.g. maximize food / energy districts, take whatever is left in mining districts.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>B. Is it a big Rural planet?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>If so, you can usually afford to turn it into what I call &quot;Suburb&quot; planets. &quot;Suburb&quot; planets are those resource-focused Rural planets that can support enough pops to grant you lots of building slots, but the main role of the planet is still to support your City planets. In that case, &quot;Suburb&quot; planets are great for all of the following:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li>Exotic refineries to produce exotic resources to feed your City worlds.</li>
<li>Tier 1 Alloy / Consumer Goods / Research buildings, because your City worlds won&#39;t grow fast enough to support <strong><em>all</em></strong> your high-end resource needs (although they will still support most.)</li>
<li>Unity producing buildings, because these take up consumer goods that you&#39;ll usually want to ration away from smaller, non-suburb worlds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, the biggest difference between smaller resource planets (Rural), and larger resource planets (Suburbs) will be the number of city districts you build there. Rural planets should only have 1 or fewer. Suburbs can have 2 or 3.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>City Planets</h1>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>As with rural / resource planets, there&#39;s a lot to think about for your city planets. I usually find there to be two good designs:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;Forge&quot; planets: Consumer Goods and Alloys</li>
<li>&quot;Tech&quot; planets: Research</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This is usually the best way to lay out your buildings because of specialty buildings you get in the mid-game:</p>

<p>&quot;Ministry of Production&quot; -- a building you get that boosts Artisan (CG) and Metallurgist (Alloys) output by +15%. This is what makes &quot;Forge&quot; worlds so good, and why -- because Forge worlds are usually inadequate at providing <strong><em>all</em></strong> your consumer goods / alloys needs -- suburb worlds (mentioned earlier) can pick up the slack with some tier 1 consumer goods and alloys.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;Research Institute&quot; -- a building that boosts Researcher output by +15%, in addition to a Science Director job, which is quite potent. This is what makes &quot;Tech&quot; worlds so good -- they can stack an enormous amount of tech points on a single planet, with bonuses like a high level scientist assisting research + the research institute.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>A few other tips:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, I put Gene Clinics on my Suburb worlds and my City worlds, but only upgrade them to Cyto-Revitalization Centers on City worlds. Similarly for Unity buildings -- it&#39;s best to only place them on Suburb / City worlds, and only upgrade them on City worlds.</li>
<li>Resource districts will eventually become obsolete on your City worlds -- there will be so many Specialist jobs, every single pop will be a Specialist.</li>
</ul>
