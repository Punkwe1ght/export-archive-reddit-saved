<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in the fragrance game for about a year and I must say I&#39;ve fallen in love with Tuscan Leather. I picked up a decent because there&#39;s something so deep and delicious to me about the smoke/leather/raspberry combo (plus my girlfriend loves it). Really a shame it&#39;s $200+, but I might gift myself a small bottle anyway. What are your thoughts about it?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So here in Texas it&#39;s just now getting on the colder side and I was wondering about what everyone likes to wear during this time. I&#39;m especially interested if anyone has any cheap suggestions, or opinions on smaller producers such as Zoologist or Imaginary Authors for Fall scents.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me:</p>

<p>April Aromatics <em>Agartha</em> - The original review snippet that hooked me: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agartha is magical with the scent of mimosa gilded with golden peach juice, then dipped in honey and delicately spiced with cardamom and a touch of oud. The scent of hay warms this beautiful limited edition fragrance that seems to glow with an otherworldly tranquility. Nectar of the gods (I&#39;m almost afraid to get it lest it disappoints).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guerlain <em>Mayotte</em> or Chanel <em>Beige</em> - for the frangipani</p>

<p>Guerlain <em>Black Perfecto</em>, LPRN</p>

<p>M. Micaleff <em>Note Vanillee</em></p>

<p>Guerlain <em>Mon Exclusif</em></p>

<p>Edited to add: Strangelove, Silence.the Sea (<em>officially over five</em>)</p>

<h2>Fragrances that smell like/remind you of camping, hiking, outdoors in the summer etc</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests, what are some fragrances that remind you purely of the outdoors? Camping, hiking, being on the lake etc. Can be niche or designer. I really want to start picking up a few bottles for spring and summer this upcoming year. Basically looking for really nice aquatic and woodsy scents. </p>

<h2>Best places for samples/decants</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted here previously describing the scents that I liked best, and got a TON of suggestions. (Thanks, guys!)  Someone suggested I get some decants, and initially I dismissed it, but now I understand why they recommended that- there are just so many options. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m sorting through the suggestions and have read about a few and I would like to sample some of them..</p>

<p>What&#39;s the most reliable, fastest shipping website I can use? I&#39;m looking for reliable because I don&#39;t want knock offs, and fast because the holidays are coming up quick, and this will most likely be gifted to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not particularly interested in using a subreddit to hunt down decants, as time is a concern here, so a website with a big selection is probably best. </p>

<p>Ideas?
Thanks!</p>

<h2>Weird or quirky perfume brand suggestions?</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What are some cool, quirky, affordable, but still pretty high quality perfume brands? I&#39;m talking about things like Demeter Fragrance Library, Zoologist, CB I Hate Perfume, Xyrena, A Beautiful Life, etc.? I love super niche weird brands like these, and would love to discover more! Thx &lt;3</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m less into weird animalistic scents, and more into petrichor, dirt, and leaf kind of scents. But I&#39;m really open to anything: woody, candy-sweet, etc. Just willing to delve into the world of fragrance and experiment!</p>
