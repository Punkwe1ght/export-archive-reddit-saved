<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the record, I know next to nothing about the guy, other than that you guys seem to dislike him. My younger brother <em>idolizes</em> him, but I&#39;m skeptical that Peterson is more than a charlatan. So I looked at the relevant threads on <a href="/r/askphilosophy">/r/askphilosophy</a>, but I don&#39;t think they really provide reasons to believe that Peterson doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. Instead, these threads merely say just that: that Peterson doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. I would be very appreciative if someone could please explain to me why Peterson doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, on topics ranging from gender pronouns, transgenderism, post-modernism, neo-Marxism, what have you. I don&#39;t know anything about any of these fields, so citations and reading suggestions would also be very appreciated.</p>

<h2>An order to read modern philosophers?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(25)">View full post</button><div id="25" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically I want to read the basic works of modern philosophers from Descartes up to Kant, and I’d like to know if there’s a “recommended order” to read these works. I’m basically working up to Kant. The philosophers I want to check out are as follows:</p>

<p>Hobbes, Descartes, Bacon, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Malebranch, and Kant.</p>

<p>I’m focusing primarily on metaphysics and epistemology, but I’d like to sprinkle some ethics and political philosophy in as well.</p>

<p>I’m not asking for a full reading list, I just want to know if it’s necessary or helpful to read any of these philosophers before any others listed.</p>

<h2>Abortion debate with my husband - Why is the potential for a "human life" or perhaps, more accurately, a "human person" not given the same moral consideration as an existing "human life/human person?"</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t have a solid moral basis or argument for my views on abortion, so I&#39;m trying to develop one. I want to convince my husband that it would be okay for me to have an abortion in the case of an accidental pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does your husband have a solid moral basis or argument for his view? If not, it seems like you&#39;re in the same boat as he is: you both have prior inclinations to a particular answer to this question, whether it be from intuition or culture or some other motivation. In other words, you both have a justification for your belief which is not grounded in an argument. (If you aren&#39;t sure what &#39;justification&#39; refers to, see <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/#WhatJust">this section</a> of a relevant SEP article, primarily the first paragraph there.)</p>

<p>In which case, I&#39;m not sure trying to build an argument against his view is the best way to go about this, because imagine if he were doing the same thing: what if he went to a different forum to find arguments for his side? Could you see yourself being open to his arguments? If not, then would you expect him to be open to your arguments, even though it&#39;s the same scenario, just from his point of view? If you both have justifications grounded elsewhere, then arguments aren&#39;t really attacking that justification at all, so it&#39;s not as likely to be effective.</p>

<p>If you truly want to come to a mutual understanding, it may be better to sit down and discuss why you and he believe what you and he believe regarding this question—not philosophical arguments you found online, but the actual reasons you/he feel the way you do. If his justification for belief is not deep-seated (i.e. he doesn&#39;t feel very strongly about it and is willing to consider the topic more), then sure, a dive into philosophy about the subject can do you both good. But if its based on something more fundamental, then he will just find arguments for his side in the same way that you&#39;re finding arguments for yours. It&#39;ll just be argument-flinging at each other, with no real analysis of the actual justifications you each have for your different answers.</p>

<p>This is a philosophy forum, so of course I&#39;m not advocating that you ignore philosophical arguments for/against a position. Rather, I&#39;m advocating that you examine the actual justification that he (and you) have in your minds, as that&#39;s the &#39;argument&#39; that you need to think about. It could be any number of things: whether something as simple as an intuition or something as complex and varied as a whole philosophical system embedded in a worldview. Whatever it is, a true philosophical argument will need to account for whatever that ground of belief is, or else no one will be likely to be convinced.</p>

<p>This is true for all philosophical questions that are important to people; questions about politics and the existence of God run into this same problem as well, where people try to convince &quot;the other side&quot; of their point of view without realizing they have the same/similar kind of justification for their belief as you do for yours. When that happens, it might be that you have to &quot;agree to disagree&quot;, recognizing that you currently cannot provide the ground for a change in their justified belief. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll need to find some kind of compromise, or else it may prove irrevocably divisive.</p>

<h2>Defense of christianity against accusations of Nietzsche.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/InspectionPretend990 </span><span class = "numcomments">20 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/12ae0sn/defense_of_christianity_against_accusations_of/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(133)">View full post</button><div id="133" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am looking for someone who has defended the christian moral values, which Nietzsche calls &quot;slave morality&quot;. I am not looking for writings where author has merely tried to differentiate slave morality and christian morality as being different and thus downplay Nietzschian criticisms in the process. </p>

<p>Christianity has been an active force even today,   especially in colonised countries like India (and South America) where christian values were used to combat aristocratic caste system (praised by Nietzsche) first by british officers and then by native christians after independence. In south america, christian clergy has employed liberation theology in support of oppressed.
Nietzsche called the christian priest &quot;tschandala&quot; which is a reference to outcaste dalits. Scholars have tried to distance Nietzsche from racism but this is indefensible. Nietzsche was also fond of brahminical culture. I can think of Peter kroptkin&#39;s quote that &quot;competition is the law of jungle but cooperation is the law of civilisations&quot;. Has anyone else written on similar lines defending the cooperative, christian slave morality against the competitive aristocratic morality of romans and indo-aryans. Does game theory say anything about this? </p>

<p>P.S.- English is not my native language. Please, forgive me for any grammatical mistakes.</p>
