<p>There&#39;s a newer one. I recommend against using Alpacalypse&#39;s list and just make your own via the website (just carefully check the subs, the tool was made by a reactionary and so the subs may be flipped from what you would find ideal). His new list is kinda messed up.  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3ri3l5/updated_tag_sets_and_introducing_ureddittagger/">https://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3ri3l5/updated_tag_sets_and_introducing_ureddittagger/</a></p>

<p>if he wasn&#39;t vain and insane and an asshole i <strong>guarantee you</strong> he would not be as big as he is today.  his positives are what made him good, but his faults are what made him great.  he&#39;s a real life heel, and he knows it, and his fans know it.  the only people not in on the joke is everybody else.  its pretty genius.  he just trolled his way to the top.</p>

<p>every time he says something stupid, and the entire world stops to tell him how wrong he is, he just gets bigger.  the fact that the entire world feels obligated to tell you that you&#39;re wrong means that you hold power.  if he didnt, they wouldnt listen to him at all.  your hate makes him bigger.</p>

<div class="md"><p>there&#39;s actually a lot of evidence, in addition to personal admissions.  the thing is,  <strong>nobody at that level does everything themselves</strong>.  nobody.  i promise you.</p>

<p>kanye is a producer in the old fashioned term of being the curator.  today we confuse producer and beatmaker but just because u didnt program every drum snare doesnt mean you didnt produce the record.</p>

<p>mainly what kanye does is he&#39;ll come up with an idea for a song.  he&#39;ll send the idea to a bunch of people and have them come up with their own versions of the original idea.  he&#39;ll then take everyone&#39;s version of one song and piece them together.  so he might take the snare from here, kick from here, sample from this guy, and put it all into a pot.  if you look at the liner notes for most of his albums (especially everything post MBDTF) there&#39;s like 10 producers on each record for this reason.</p>

<p>even on his early stuff he received a lot of help.  by his own admission the last beat he made on his own by himself with no help was overnight celebrity (which is a great beat).  late registration was just as much jon brion&#39;s album as it was ye&#39;s.  808&#39;s and heartbreak was kid cudi.  the list goes on and on.  </p>

<p>this doesn&#39;t mean kanye isn&#39;t talented, however.  just because you don&#39;t do the leg work anymore doesn&#39;t mean its not your idea.  he&#39;s a master collaborator.  he&#39;s the only person who can take chief keef and bon iver and put them on the same song and make it work.  shit like that.  he&#39;s a modern day quincy jones.</p>

<h2>Things get dirty in r/games when users debate Clean Wehrmacht</h2>

<div class="md"><p>This is an old comment I made once up a time. I&#39;m just going to cut and paste it here.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the Wehrmacht was complicit in the Holocaust.  The Myth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Wehrmacht">Clean Wehrmacht</a> is just that: <strong>a myth</strong>.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht">They committed War Crimes</a> and were involved in the Holocaust from the beginning. </p>

<p>der Spiegel did a long series of articles about this myth a few years back: </p>

<h2>Fight in /r/starterpacks over whether or not Ben Shapiro is an idiot.</h2>

<div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/">Here&#39;s a pretty good example of Ben Shapiro&#39;s intellectual dishonesty</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a produced video where Ben Shapiro says that almost all Muslims are radical extremists. Or at least, he&#39;s refuting the claim that &quot;a small minority of muslims are radical extremists.&quot;</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is a produced video. He wasn&#39;t adlibbing here, these are all prepared statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Indonesia) got almost 205 million Muslims. According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it’s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We’re just getting started.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claiming that people &quot;Support Sharia Law&quot; is equivalent to being a radical is super disingenuous. It&#39;s like asking a Christian person if they support Christina beliefs and think that everyone should follow Jesus. For some people that will mean &quot;Burn all the gays.&quot; For a whole lot of other people, it means &quot;Help your neighbor&quot;.</p>

<p>The politifact article discusses this in a more clearer light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts.</p>

<p>According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then you dear reader, have to decide for yourself if Ben Shapiro is ignorant, or manipulative. If you truly believe that Shapiro does his own ground research, and works hard to uncover the truth, then these alternative statistics would have  been easy to find and report on. Shapiro instead decided to create a video with cheery-picked stats and misleading data.</p>

<p>Why? Because it works with what he already believes, or because his viewing audience already believes it.</p>
