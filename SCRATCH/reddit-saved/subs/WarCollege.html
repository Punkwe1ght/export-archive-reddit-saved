<button onclick="toggles(18)">View full post</button><div id="18" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was reading about the Armyâ€™s efforts to stay relevant in a nuclear dominated battlefield with the Pentomic structure, and while much can be said about its actual implementation and efficacy, I wonder if countries like the US still put thought into potential conventional warfare even after a MAD style nuclear exchange. </p>

<p>Or is the general assumption that any nuclear exchange would result in so much damage that any conventional forces would be useless and could not commit any meaningful action? </p>

<p>If so, when and why did countries drop that mentality of continuing the fight even after the nukes are launched?</p>
