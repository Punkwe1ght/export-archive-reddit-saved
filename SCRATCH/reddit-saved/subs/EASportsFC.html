<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mostly for the new guys to the sub, but also for people like me who were consistently taking shitty first touches, only to get steamrolled by the defense.</p>

<p>These 3 tips helped TREMENDOUSLY with my possession game. I like playing a slow build-up kind of offense, but I would always get REKT in the midfield by my opponents. Slide tackles and high pressure defense tactics used to make me RAGE, but now I can usually get a few really good looks against this type of opponent. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Press and hold LT/L2 when receiving the pass! I used to do this, but this is a NECESSITY if you&#39;re going to use the other steps. Using this button makes the player shield the ball with his body, and he also controls the ball much faster/easier than receiving a pass without using this button.</p></li>
<li><p>USE THE RIGHT ANALOG STICK!!! This is what really took my game to another level. I would always receive the ball nicely then get steamrolled by Ramires and lose possession in the midfield. Now I use the right analog stick. It allows you to take the first touch AWAY from pressure. So if you see a guy running towards your right, when you receive the pass, hold LT/L2 and move the right analog stick SLIGHTLY to the left. Your player will take the first touch in that direction, and the pressure defender will run right past you.</p></li>
<li><p>FAKE SHOT when you receive the ball. It provides a quick change of direction, and your opponents cannot guess which way you&#39;re going to go. I almost always fake shot when I receive a pass, especially when it&#39;s in the middle of the field. The only downfall to this move is that you really have to do it confidently, or you&#39;ll end up crossing or shooting the ball (depending on which button combination you use).</p></li>
<li><p>The dummy. I&#39;ve been using this, but I can&#39;t write first touch tips without the dummy! When you receive the ball, hold R1/right front bumper and the ball will roll through your players legs. He&#39;ll then turn around and run on the ball. Incredibly effective against high pressure opponents, especially when your close to the box. (Also really easy way to pick up fouls against slide tacklers and people like that)</p></li>
<li><p>I think this mainly applies to skillers (I have Chikhaoui and Ronaldo up front - shameless plug :)), but when you receive the ball, hold LT and press R1. Your players will take the first touch, and juggle the ball in the air. I&#39;m not sure why, but it leaves the defenders dazed and confused. You can then either flick the ball over your head and around your opponent, or you can put it on the ground and take it from there. Incredibly effective.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps someone. I&#39;m getting tired of playing high pressure people who just hold sprint all game. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that people can&#39;t play a good game, or don&#39;t want to play a good game, but if it&#39;s a CAN&#39;T, then I&#39;m willing to share the knowledge!</p>
