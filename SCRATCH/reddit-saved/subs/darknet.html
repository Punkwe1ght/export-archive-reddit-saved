<h2>Guide to Monero</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(878)">View full post</button><div id="878" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts lately by people who still use Bitcoin (BTC), so I decided to make a beginner&#39;s guide to Monero (XMR).</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I AM IN NO WAY AN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD AND DO NOT GUARANTEE 100% ANONYMITY WITH THIS GUIDE. THIS IS JUST MY BEST KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THIS SUBJECT.</p>

<p>What is XMR?
XMR is just like BTC, it is a cryptocurrency. The difference between XMR and BTC is that XMR is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. With BTC, everybody can see the sender, recipient and the amount send via Blockchain. XMR is different, with XMR, no outsiders can see the sender, recipient and the amount sent. This makes using XMR better for opsec.</p>

<p>How can you obtain XMR?
There are multiple ways to obtain XMR:
1. You can buy it via exchanges<em>.
2. You can buy it via localmonero.
3. You can exchange other cryptocurrencies</em>* to XMR.</p>

<p>If you bought BTC (doesn&#39;t matter from where), you can exchange it for XMR. I find these 2 ways the easiest:
- Use exchanging platforms to convert BTC to XMR. I personally use Morphtoken*** for this process, you simply fill in the amount, the recipient address (you XMR address) and the return/refund address (your BTC address, this is incase you fill in an invalid XMR address or something went wrong during the transaction).
However, Morphtoken is restricted in certain countries which brings me to the next method.
- You can exchange them via crypto-wallets that support both BTC and XMR. I&#39;ve heard great things about Exodus Wallet***. It supports both BTC and XMR so you can convert BTC to XMR within the wallet-app.</p>

<p>What wallets should I use?
Personally, I recommend and use the GUI Wallet (desktop) and Cake Wallet (phone).
<em>They&#39;re both linked to same wallet</em>
Other wallets are fine, there is a list of trusted wallets on <a href="/r/monero">r/monero</a>.</p>

<p>XMR on TailsOS?
Personally I don&#39;t think this is necessary as no outsiders can see your activity. However, if you like, you can set up the GUI Wallet on your Tails persistant storage.</p>

<p>Sending XMR...
These are some combinations of processes you could do to send XMR to your Market Wallet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buying XMR via exchange/localmonero:
Exchange/Localmonero Wallet -&gt; GUI/Cake/Other Wallet -&gt; Market Wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Exchanging BTC to XMR via Morphtoken (bought via BTC exchange):
BTC Exchange Wallet -using Morphtoken-&gt; GUI/Cake/Other Wallet -&gt; Market Wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Exchanging BTC to XMR via <em>multi-support</em> wallet (bought via BTC exchange):
BTC Exchange Wallet -&gt; Exodus/multi-support Wallet -&gt; Market Wallet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: NEVER SEND ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY STRAIGHT FROM YOUR EXCHANGE WALLET TO YOUR MARKET WALLET!</p>

<p><em>Most exchanges don&#39;t sell XMR directly, which brings me to the next point (see point 3).
*</em>For this guide I&#39;ll be using BTC as bought crypto
***I am in no way affiliated with these organisations, they are just platforms I heard about or used. You are free to use other platforms. ALWAYS CHECK IF THE USED PLATFORM/WALLET IS LEGIT.</p>
