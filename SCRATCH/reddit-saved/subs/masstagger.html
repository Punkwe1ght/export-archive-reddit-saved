<p>I&#39;ve tentatively gotten the server online again. Sorry again to all who were unable to try out the extension!</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>UPDATE 7/6: Whitelisting has been added! Thanks to all those who suggested this improvement. To whitelist a user, follow the tagger link to their profile page by clicking their tag. There you&#39;ll find a button to whitelist the user. Your whitelist can also be managed from the options menu. Have fun!</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>What&#39;s up folks? I&#39;m back, and I&#39;ve got an all new masstagger for you guys.</p>

<p>A lot of you probably used/remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/masstagger/comments/78gtap/res_broke_mass_tagging_so_i_made_my_own/">my old tagger</a>. Let&#39;s be honest, the thing was kind of dog shit. I mean, it technically worked, but it was a real pain in the ass to overwrite your tags every day, it grabbed everyone, and not everyone shares my view that <a href="/r/drama">r/drama</a> users are the scum of the earth. Well boy have I got the update for you.</p>

<p>First things first, link: <a href="https://masstagger.com">https://masstagger.com</a></p>

<h1>Changes</h1>

<p>#1: That&#39;s right, it&#39;s a browser plugin.</p>

<p>Available on firefox and chrome, the plugin is a one-time install. Users are automatically retrieved every time you load a page. Performance impact is minimal from my testing, and data usage, if that&#39;s an issue, is a couple of KB a page.</p>

<p>#2: Minimum post count filter</p>

<p>Probably the most requested feature, this filter allows you to set a minimum number of posts to be considered a &quot;user&quot; of the sub. Raise the bar, and you&#39;ll only get people who are <em>absolutely</em> active users. Lower it a bit, and you&#39;ll get everyone who posts there. The choice is yours</p>

<p>#3: Subreddit sorting</p>

<p>Probably my favorite addition. The new tagger allows you to sort and exclude subreddits as you wish. Want to build a custom filter just for truly nazi subs? You can do it! Would you rather know if someone is a <a href="/r/The_Donald">r/The_Donald</a> user than a <a href="/r/TumblrInAction">r/TumblrInAction</a> user? Totally possible!</p>

<p>#4: Custom colors</p>

<p>Hell yeah, you can tag every single subreddit with a custom color of your choosing. I like my <a href="/r/The_Donald">r/The_Donald</a> nice and orange.</p>

<p>#5: Profile pages</p>

<p>The old tagger linked to the post that first got the user tagged. Useful, but not enough info. Now, simply click on the tag, and you&#39;ll be taken straight to a list of every single post they&#39;re tagged for.</p>

<p>Let me know how it works for you. As of release, it&#39;s been lightly tested, but early adopters will effectively be beta testers, so please hit me up with any issues you encounter or suggestions you may have.</p>

<p>Happy tagging!</p>
