<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Meddit, I&#39;m currently a graduate student working toward my Masters in Healthcare Administration. I&#39;ve recently realized I want to do the hands on side of healthcare rather than the administrative side. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been leaning toward the PA route, but I can&#39;t help but think about the MD route. </p>

<p>I was hoping those of you who are already in medicine could answer a few questions for me: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do PA&#39;s really get that much more free time to spend with friends &amp; family over an MD? </p></li>
<li><p>Does malpractice insurance make it almost not worth it to be an MD? I know of a few doctors who recently retired early because the malpractice insurance was killing &#39;em. </p></li>
<li><p>This one may be harder to answer, unless a Radiation Oncologist reads this. I was curious to know how long the residency period is for that specialty. I understand usually family doctor is on the lower end, with surgeries being on the higher. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any information would help. Thank you, Meddit, for your time. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to know if any doctors here would, or do, refer patients to a chiropractor and what reasons they have for this decision. Has a chiropractor referred patients to you?</p>

<p>If you wouldn&#39;t, what are some things a chiropractor could do that would make you more comfortable about referring to them?</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for some rational discussion here so I ask you to refrain from being hostile.</p>

<h2>What is the deal with the animosity between chiropractors and MDs/DOs?</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have quite a few friends who are chiropractors or are in school for it. For the most part, they&#39;re always complaining how physicians do everything incorrectly and that a chiropractors homeopathic remedies and body/extremity manipulation are significantly better therapies then pharmacological or surgical therapy. </p>

<p>My question, where does this animosity arise from? Are the professors from DC universities always undermining the actions of MDs/DOs?</p>
