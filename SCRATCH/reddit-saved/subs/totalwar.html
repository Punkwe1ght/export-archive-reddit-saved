<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I feel like a bit of an idiot, but after two whole campaigns as Clan Angrund I still don&#39;t really know when to use what unit against what. As Empire everything makes sense to me, you use swordsmen against light-med infantry, spears/halberds against cav and monsters etc etc. But for the Dwarves they seem kinda... homogenous? Like when is it superior to use Hammerers vs Ironbreakers? What should be my go to against cav? Do they have a go to against cav seeing as how the entire race has charge defense against large? Are Thunderers worth it? In my campaigns it <em>seemed</em> to me that Quarrellers were actually doing far more damage over time but that doesn&#39;t really make sense to me. Also, when is it superior to use great weapons as opposed to shield and hand weapon? I thought the Quarrellers would benefit from great weapons but they actually seemed to perform FAR worse in melee. Pretty much any tips or pointers would be helpful.</p>

<p>edit: also, when the hell do I use Irondrakes/Trollhammers? These units seem incredibly difficult to pull off and often times I find a cannon or another unit of Quarrellers does more than they do even in good conditions. Would love insight on these two units. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Even WITH the +10% speed boost mod the enemy just seem to know exactly how to be one little step away from being attacked. I was chasing a Dwarf army for turns until I finally thought I had him trapped, a small force of goblins to hopefully slow him down plus my main force and my WAAAGH!. He starts in march mode, changes to normal, engages and beats my Waaagh <em>twice</em> to obliterate it (I didn&#39;t get any reinforcements despite my armies all being close), he then moves away, kills the small goblin force, changes back to marched and sprints away. Meanwhile my main force that can still beat him has to change off marched back to normal stance but is amazingly, just one step away from him.</p>

<p>Next turn the Dwarf just marches off... again into the distance.</p>

<p>What the utter... </p>

<p>(edit forgot to mention this was him shrugging off three attempts to block his movement with my goblin big boss who then had a critical failure to take him out of action)</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few mods that reduces their aggressiveness, if that&#39;ll help anything. I don&#39;t think any can help your current campaign though. </p>

<p>Defensive Wood Elves makes them severely defensive. There&#39;s also Loreful Diplomatic Affinity which enhances the overall diplomacy system and reduces elves aggressiveness. Lastly I think Steel Faith Overhaul Mod touches on them as well.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i picked up the Beastmen DLC a week ago and i have been struggling ever since.</p>

<p>I feel like they aren&#39;t really good at anything. I mean as far as i understand The empire is a jack of all trades, the Vampire Counts have fear, powerful monsters, cheap infantry and regeneration, Dwarfs have (i think) the strongest and most resilient infantry with strong ranged units, the Greenskins have a large variety of hard hitting units, Wood elves are fucking cancer and Chaos has pretty damn sexy looking units (aspiring champions lowkey daddy af)</p>

<p>I feel like everyone has glaring strengths. But i just can&#39;t get the grips of this faction.</p>

<p>So what are they good at? What niche strats do they have access to? How to play them? Army formations? General information is welcome too.</p>

<h2>Noob Questions about TW:W and Total War in general.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/michimatsch </span>
<span class = "numcomments">39 comments </span>
<a href="/r/totalwar/comments/5sl0d4/noob_questions_about_tww_and_total_war_in_general/ddfubci/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('ddfubci')">View full post</button>
<div id="ddfubci" class="mdwrapper">
<div class="md"><p>1)Don&#39;t start with the Empire!
They are bloody hard to play (campaign wise).
I am used to playing Total War on very hard and when I bought Warhammer and tried to do that I ended up having to restart the campaign 4 times before I finally maanged to win.</p>

<p>Greenskins and Dwarves are still easy to learn battle wise and don&#39;t have the hardest campaign.</p>

<p>2) Economic buildings are extremly important in Total War games.
In Warhammer there is sadly usually only one per province (unless you got extra ressources) and the question should never be if you should buy them but why you shouldn&#39;t buy them.</p>

<p>3)Enemy agents of certain factions (Chaos, Vampires) will spread corruption if they are inside your borders. Beastmen and Chaos armies will also spread them. Smite these heretics in Sigmars name!
Agents work in a rock-paper-scissor way so have a look at that. 
Your agents actually help diminish corrutpion but I imagine there is just too much corruption. 
At a certain point enemies will start to corrupt your lands via Osmosis. There is not a whole lot you can do about that so think about building a temple of Sigmar to make sure to keep the corruption contained.</p>

<p>Never share a province with Vampire counts unless you are currently conquering them. The corruption is rly horrible.</p>

<p>Corruption is probably tha main reason your guys are so bloody pissed at you. Nobody likes his dead bretheren reanimating and trying to eat them, know what I mean?</p>

<p>If the issue with public order still persists after getting rid of the corruption you should build some public order buildings. 
I usually have at least one per province.
If nothing helps you can also park an army (the bigger the better) inside a city to get a huge public order bonus by supressing the populace.</p>

<p>4)Not sure what QoL means but get Defensive Wood Elves. I played without it because I wanted to experience it but the consensus is that this is a must have as Wood Elves will just stomp everything in the south within 50 turns.
Steel Faith mod is a mod that is held in pretty high esteem as well and a personal favorit of mine because it feels closer to the Lore withoutmaking the game unbalanced.</p>

<p>5) Having it as normal content would make the game 18+ so less customers for CA</p>

<p>6) I&#39;d say Rome 2 wiht the new Divide et Impera mod. A lot will say Shogun2.</p>

<p>Cheers and enjoy the game</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
    <p>Some people will say mods that add more movement in your territory or ones to remove agents, but they&#39;re not and just make the game easier. You can use agents to slow armies to catch them if you need to and you can use agents to kill agents. I don&#39;t like mods that make things easier so I don&#39;t recommend those.</p>

<p>And someone asked for mod recommendations earlier today too so here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/5sepmk/workshopmods_for_warhammer/">link</a> to that in case you don&#39;t get many answers. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my lore friendly recommendations I copy &amp; paste from an old comment I made whenever someone asks:</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754870269">Better Campaign Map - Overhauled</a>. Makes the campaign map look tons better. I wish CA would take this mod and add it to the game permanently because it would suck to lose such a great mod in the future when the modder eventually gets tired of updating with every game update.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=800689133">Lokerian&#39;s Better AI</a>. Makes the AI do things like resettle more. Just got it but it makes the campaign more enjoyable from what I&#39;ve played of it. </p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=700177199">Animated Combat Mod</a>. I use this a lot so I don&#39;t even remember what the game is like without it. Makes combat more animated.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=703035289">Unit Size Expansions</a>. Increases the amount of troops in a unit for all units in the game so you can have much bigger battles. Will effect performance so you&#39;ll need a good PC.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=784132196">Daelin&#39;s Unit Resize - Lore Friendly</a>. Just changes the height of the people and monsters to better fit lore. For example: &quot;*Greenskin&#39;s grow as they fight and get older, heights are resized among orc &amp; goblin Lords and Heroes to reflect this Lore&quot; So Orc bosses will be bigga! </p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=690476829">Better Camera Mod</a>. Lets you zoom in and out more which is really nice.</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760237805">Dirty Zombies</a>. Makes the zombies much creepier looking. It triggers my zombie phobia.</p>

<p>Also, a few new ones I&#39;ve been using and am not sure about yet:</p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724263018">All Tabletop Lords</a></p>

<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=759346526">Regiments of Renown!</a></p>
