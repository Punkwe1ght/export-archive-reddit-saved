<button onclick="toggles(733)">View full post</button><div id="733" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Hamnøy is one of the oldest fishing villages on the Norwegian Lofoten Islands with the oldest cabin dating back to the 1890s. Originally built as simple accommodation for fishermen, most of them are renovated to modern standards and free to rent for tourists.</p>

<p>I took this shot on my first morning on the Islands after a night without much sleep due to (unsuccessful) aurora chasing the night before, while I also had to get up before 6 am to catch the blue hour. Luckily the clouds that covered the aurora cleared up for sunrise and I got this view of these Lodges near the village Hamnøy.</p>
