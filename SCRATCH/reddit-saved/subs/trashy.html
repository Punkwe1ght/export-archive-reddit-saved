<button onclick="toggles(588)">View full post</button><div id="588" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Hello.  I&#39;ve spent a good portion of my life devoted to the study of history.  I hold two degrees in the subject and a friend of mine is a professor of Civil War studies.  I grew up in the South, specifically in the Appalachian region. The &quot;both sides&quot; argument for the Civil War is one more attempt at making a war that was flawed from the beginning look less horrible.</p>

<p>I would urge you to read further and view the primary documents created.  The war itself was fought over slavery.  We can couch it in whatever language necessary; states&#39; rights, etc.  At the end of the day, it boiled down to a state&#39;s right to own slaves.  Please go through and read some of the secessionist state&#39;s reasoning for seceding.</p>

<p>Here is a resource from the American Historical Association on teaching the war.  This page has links to the Confederate Constitution and four of the secessionist state&#39;s &quot;Declaration of Secession.&quot;  Those states being; Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Texas.</p>

<p>A cursory dive into the Georgia declaration starts with a highlight of &quot;the history of anti-slavery sentiment by the federal government.&quot;  With the election of Lincoln (an anti-slavery president), the Georgia declaration says they have no choice but to secede to keep slavery.  </p>

<p>It is important to note that the South was built on slavery.  Southern industry did not largely exist and the economic backbone of the south was farming.  Slavery was a huge part of this and the exploitation of free labor meant the benefits of the system could be reaped by those at the top easier.  </p>

<p>This is why when you dive into individual men who signed up and fought during the war, you won&#39;t largely see slavery listed.  These men fought to &quot;preserve their Southern ideals&quot; or &quot;protect their lands&quot; or any other number of ideas.  The knowledge, however, that the South was built on slavery makes these ideals all connect back to the ever-present and overarching identity of the South as a slave-holding land.</p>

<p>The &quot;both sides&quot; argument here is frustrating because we should never celebrate the Confederacy.  We should never venerate men like Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, or those at the top.  We shouldn&#39;t celebrate the confederate soldiers who signed up to fight for, at the end of the day, slavery.  In my own ancestry as a southerner from Appalachia, I have ancestors who fought for the Confederacy and a few ancestors who fought for America.  These were people from the same community.  The narrative that the collective &quot;South&quot; supported the Civil War is fraught with peril as well.  There was opposition to slavery and the war brewing across the South.</p>

<p>It is in diving into the history of scholarship around the Civil War that we start to uncover why so many southerners still cling to this idea of &quot;heritage not hate&quot; and &quot;the South shall rise again&quot; mentality.  In the 1880s, the first scholarship about the war started at the University of Virginia.  Former confederate general Jubal Early started teaching the history of the Civil War as a &quot;lost cause&quot; for the South.  </p>

<p>We must pause because this is post-Reconstruction.  The attempt at rebuilding after the war was met with many problems and efforts were stymied across the board.  Those who had been downtrodden prior to the war (non slave-holding southerners) were taken advantage of even more following the war.  The blame for the war, rightly placed on southern states, started to impact politics at the time and harsh penalties placed on the southern states slowed economic recovery.</p>

<p>Into this frustration of seeing a growing class of wealthy northern Industrialists and poor southern subsistence farmers, Jubal Early starts teaching that the South losing the war was a &quot;Lost Cause&quot; from the beginning.  The decision was boiled down to states&#39; rights and it was taught that it was a &quot;good, if ill-informed, fight over a right for a state to choose for itself.&quot;  In this way, former confederate soldiers could agree with this.  Southern states could accept this narrative and still save face and move forward.  It wasn&#39;t that their cause was horrible, it was that the cause was just, but the war was inevitable from the beginning.  The Lost Cause taught that the South had better generals, these men who are statues and perfect examples of manliness.  The object of greatest affection here became recently deceased Robert E. Lee.  Lee became the quintessential southern gentleman.  He was a general given an impossible task and yet he faced it anyway.  These southern generals were taught to be paragons of virtue and fighting to defend their homes and homeland against the northern aggressors.  This caused scholarship around the war to take on the tone of &#39;War of Northern Aggression&#39; in many southern states.  It was also taught that the war simply could not be won by the South because the North had more men at their disposal, they had more industry, they had more resources and allies.  All this narrative of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; played into the idea that the South knew it would lose, but HAD to fight to defend their homes.</p>

<p>Instead of it being a war about Southern states wanting to make sure they could keep people as human chattel, it became a war about defending your home, defending your territory, and standing up for what is right.  The Lost Cause school became so popular that it is still the dominant narrative for how the Civil War is taught in many, many southern schools.  I myself was given this school of thought and I remember my teacher saying, &quot;War of Northern Aggression&quot; in the 1990s.  </p>

<p>I urge everyone who has interest in these topics to do some research.  And by research, I don&#39;t mean the current trend of internet research to find websites, youtube videos, and articles that fit your preconceived notion and bias.  Look for experts on these topics.  If you find a youtube video that seems to be good, dig a little deeper.  Who created the video?  Why did they create (for education or is there a deeper agenda here)?  Who funds that channel?  Where does the person who posted the video spend their funds and who do they support?  I would say, Stay off youtube.</p>

<p>Search in scholarly journals.  Jstor is a great compendium of articles and your local library may have a subscription.  We must remember that historical texts can sometimes be a product of their time.  Scholarship on the Civil War from the 1960s may look different than scholarship in the 1990s/200s.  Cast a wide array for your sources.  Look at each one, read it and keep notes.  Find common threads in the research done by experts on the topic.  Just because someone doesn&#39;t hold a degree doesn&#39;t mean they are not an expert, however be certain to find what led you to that resource and what led the creator to make the resource as well.  This is an interesting take on the difference between a <a href="https://andrewpegoda.com/2014/12/03/i-am-many-things-but-a-history-buff-is-not-one-of-them-hidden-power-of-words-series-14/">historian and a history buff</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few resources on &quot;How to conduct Historical Research&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://ecu.au.libguides.com/historical-research-method">Edith Cowan University Resource</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/hi216/HI598/histresguide.htm">Resource from College of Humanities and Social Science at NCSU-somewhat dated but still applicable</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/introhist">A resource of resources from University of Wisconsin</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m happy to engage further.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>:  Wow, this got a lot of traction and I&#39;m glad it has been a good read for folks.  I would like to point people to historians MUCH more well-versed on this subject than I, if you have a true interest in the topic.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>For a deeper dive into individual reasons for joining the war, the book <em>For Cause and Comrades</em> by James McPherson is great.  McPherson is a historian and professor at Princeton University.</p></li>
<li><p>For an approach to understanding the causes of the war and the shifting nature of the Republican party, I would suggest Eric Foner&#39;s <em>Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men</em>.  Foner is a historian at Columbia University.</p></li>
<li><p>A deeper dive into why the Southern states seceded can be found in <em>Apostles of Disunion</em> by Charles Dew.   Dew is a professor of American History at Williams College.</p></li>
<li><p>For a look into how Robert E. Lee was established as the quintessential southern gentleman that all southerners should aspire to, I would suggest <em>The Marble Man</em> by Thomas Lawrence Connelly.  The book is much older than the others I have mentioned (1977) and still connects Lee to the rise of the Lost Cause school.  It is largely a historiography (a history of the history) and shows how Lee rose to such status as more of a statue/ideal of a person than a fully-fledged human.  Connelly was a professor of history at the University of South Carolina.</p></li>
<li><p>A good primer (but I would continue reading other works) on the myth of the Lost Cause is <em>The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History</em> which collects a few different articles from historian to discuss the causes of the war and a historiography (a history of the history).</p></li>
