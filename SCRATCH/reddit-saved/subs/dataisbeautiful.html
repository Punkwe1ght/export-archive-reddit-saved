<div class="md"><p>Do you remember when President Obama took Michelle on that date to NY and then Republicans raised hell, then tried to have an &#39;investigation&#39; in the misuse of taxpayer dollars?
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/obama/articles/2009/06/09/the-political-cost-of-the-obamas-date-night">https://www.usnews.com/news/obama/articles/2009/06/09/the-political-cost-of-the-obamas-date-night</a></p>

<p>Republicans raked Obama over the coals for this ONE date, but Donald Trump has currently spent about 21% of his presidency <strong><em>on his own fucking golf courses</em></strong> costing the taxpayer approx $46 million dollars already. I repeat: on Trump banded courses that he <em>directly</em> gets paid for each secret service rented golf cart and each of his staff that has to get a Trump owned hotel room at market rate. Republicans are silent. They don&#39;t care. <a href="http://trumpgolfcount.com/">http://trumpgolfcount.com/</a></p>

<p>This does not even include this children&#39;s expenses travel the globe with Secret Service protection. (Saint Reagan declined SS protection for his grown children). <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/03/06/518367429/these-days-business-travel-by-trumps-sons-is-costly-and-complicated">http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/03/06/518367429/these-days-business-travel-by-trumps-sons-is-costly-and-complicated</a></p>

<p>&quot;Trump reported $37.2 million in income in the past year from Mar-a-Lago, the private Florida resort where Trump hosted the president of China and ordered missile strikes against Syria. The club has <strong><em>doubled its membership fee in the past year.&quot;</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doubled the fee at Mar-a-lago when he was elected.</p>
