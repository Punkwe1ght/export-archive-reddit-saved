<h2>Who is a mathematician that deserves a movie? (That doesn’t already have one)</h2>

I knew him for a few years before he passed away and thought his biography ‘Genius At Play’ did a good job describing his life as the people close to him knew him. He was funny, charismatic and essentially made his life by looking at everything as a game and searching for optimal strategies. He has contributions to almost every branch of mathematics and knew how to get his point across.</p>

<h2>Where to research about mathematical finance?</h2>

I’m pursuing an MS in statistics after I graduate. I have realized I really enjoy the applications of statistics and mathematics to finance. However, besides MFE (masters in financial engineering) degrees, I have yet to find places where people research mathematical finance as an academic discipline. Is this done within specific quantitative finance phd program? Applied math PhD programs? Math PhD programs? I have yet to find any statistics departments which study finance applications. An MFE seems more like a professional degree and I don’t want to do another masters. Id like to ideally be in a phd program where I am researching statistics and mathematics applied to financial data or problems in quant finance</p>

<h2>What area of “pure math” does probability intersect with?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(182)">View full post</button><div id="182" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Though I’m pure math student, I have recently been getting into probability and enjoying a lot. Although I’ve always heard of it as an “applied” subject, it seems like there is a lot of theoretical machinery from analysis and measure theory that goes into it. I was wondering, is there any cool intersection with probability and something like algebra, analysis, or geometry?</p>
