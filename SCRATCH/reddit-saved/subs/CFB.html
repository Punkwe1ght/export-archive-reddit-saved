<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know GT&#39;s season was a disappointment but their offense is still an incredibly fun one to watch (when it&#39;s working).  For those of you unaware I used to release these videos every week but life got in the way post FSU so I&#39;ve been trying to catch up.</p>

<p>If you want to watch the offense when it&#39;s working well I&#39;d check out Tulane and Alcorn State.</p>

<p>If you want to watch the best defensive game plan to stop it I&#39;d watch the Clemson game (can we get Venables a head job somewhere?)</p>

<p>Overall the season was torpedo&#39;d by injuries and inconsistent OL play.  There were far more negative/no gain plays than a successful offense can overcome.  </p>

<p>And for the sake of conversation - remember that it&#39;s not considered a &quot;triple option offense&quot;.  The triple option (or inside veer) is a base play in the greater whole of what&#39;s known as the Flexbone offense.  If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the offense/plays let me know.</p>

<h2>What's Going on With the ACC?</h2>

<div id="41u81q" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello <a href="/u/Fifth_Down">/u/Fifth_Down</a> here. I&#39;m back with another one of my offseason self posts. This is a writeup on why the conferences voted the way they did on the CCG Big 12 vote. <a href="http://sportspolitico.com/2016/01/20/is-there-a-feud-between-the-acc-and-the-big-ten/">As usual I include the link to the blog post this is based on.</a></p>

<h1></h1>

<p>With the recent vote by the NCAA allowing the Big 12 to host a conference championship game (CCG), one of the biggest offseason questions is now put to bed. However the way in which the vote was carried out exposed a number of other issues. One of these issues was the political vulnerability of the ACC.</p>

<p>The discussion regarding the CCG rule change is mostly associated with the Big 12. This disregards the fact that the ACC was much more aggressive in pursuing this rule change. The ACC was the first conference to formally vote on sending legislation to the NCAA. It was the ACC who sent the current proposal to the NCAA whereas the Big 12 simply collaborated with the ACC on it.</p>

<p>The Big 12 approached this rule change with lukewarm support. They stated that they were in favor of it, but they didn’t do anything to suggest they would implement it as soon as possible if the rule was passed. Their rhetoric suggested that they were open to the possibility, but also satisfied with the status quo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the actions of the ACC suggest a sense of urgency. In late 2013 emails by the Syracuse athletic director came to light. These emails exposed discontent over cross-divisional rivalries having long multi-year gaps of not being played. It also expressed concerns that the resources of the conference (recruiting and markets) were not being fairly or appropriately distributed among the ACC membership in the current divisional setup. These issues were further exposed last summer when Wake Forest and North Carolina took the unusual step of scheduling a non-conference game. Additional reports soon followed suggesting other ACC schools were making similar considerations.</p>

<p>The ACC has struggled to find a satisfactory divisional arrangement. They have an extremely complex conference web of resources and rivalries that need to be factored in. Their failure to find an ideal setup is why the conference pushed so hard for this rule change. Their plan was to use a non-divisional model, which the original rule did not allow.</p>

<p>The original proposal for this rule change called for a total deregulation allowing conferences to host a CCG without abiding by the divisional requirement, or the requirement that a conference have at least 12 teams. This proposal was expected to pass until the Big Ten pushed forward an amendment to the proposal. The Big Ten amendment called for the rule change to be modified so that the new setup would allow a conference with less than 12 teams to host a CCG, but it still required a divisional setup.</p>

<p>The general attitude regarding this specific amendment took a “Big 12 verse Big Ten” or “Big Ten is against CCG deregulation” perspective. Both of these perspectives are incorrect. The Big Ten amendment was aimed more so at the ACC as it specifically banned the type of scheduling arrangement the ACC wanted to replace a divisional setup with. For the Big 12 it was only a minor inconvenience. At the same time Delany publicly stated that he was simply trying to prevent the new rule from being abused, and he never appeared to disagree with the rule in principle.</p>

<p>As a result from concerns raised over the impact that the amendment would have on the Big 12, the Big Ten proposed a second amendment that acted as a compromise. The second amendment allowed for a CCG only to conferences that had less than 12 teams, and played a round robin schedule. </p>

<p>This second amendment once again did absolutely nothing for the ACC. It would eventually pass with only the AAC and ACC voting against it. It was as if the B1G was taking a direct shot at the ACC and the Big 12 was simply caught in the crossfire. Once the Big 12 got what they wanted, they abandoned the ACC.</p>

<p>There are a number of intriguing takeaways from how this vote went down regarding the relationship between the ACC and Big Ten (B1G). </p>

<p>The first takeaway is that that the B1G showed a willingness to completely screw over the ACC. The second takeaway is that the B1G demonstrated the ability to work with the Big 12 to alleviate their concerns, but did not extend a similar hand to help the ACC. The last takeaway is that the B1G displayed an enormous show of power by taking what had previously been near unanimous support regarding total deregulation, and channeling that support into their own voting block against.</p>

<p>The B1G not only treated the ACC with complete brutality. They did it regarding an issue that was key to the ACC’s stability and long-term survival. They did it without attempting to make a more reasonable amendment that would prevent abuse, while still allowing the ACC to host a “no divisions” CCG. We normally don’t see tactics like these deployed between two power conferences unless one considers the other an enemy, or the existence of a feud. So somewhere down the line the ACC must have done something that enraged the Big Ten.</p>

<p>Most people assume that the two biggest geopolitical rivals in the P5 are the ACC and Big 12 because they are the two weakest conferences in a system that is better tailored to having only four power conferences. While this is true, the perception of weakness is a mutually shared issue. This gives the two conferences overlapping interests. The CCG collaboration we have seen between the two conferences isn’t the first time we have seen them work together. Another example is the assistance the Big 12 gave the ACC in framing a Grant of Rights. These two conferences are both focused on survival and there is only one territory (West Virginia) where the two conference footprints overlap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the B1G and the ACC have been in an intense battle for control of the Northeast. Both of these conferences have made multiple expansions of Northeast schools. The two conferences have been trying to outdo each other by building a stronger Northeast  presence or brand. The crown jewel of the Northeast in this regard is the Big East Basketball Tournament (BET). </p>

<p>No college sporting event comes close to it in New York City. The BET is now only a former shell of itself under a new Big East conference. But this hasn’t stopped the ACC &amp; B1G from trying to replicate some of the success it had in the past by bringing their own conference tournaments to New York City. </p>

<p>The catch 22 for both conferences is that the A-10 and (new) Big East have exclusive rights to host conference tournaments at MSG and Barclays (the two most prestigious NYC basketball locations). The ACC and B1G ended up making special deals with the two non-FBS conferences for the right to play at those arenas. This shows the extent that these conferences are willing to go in order to build a strong Northeast presence and to check the moves of each other. This came on top of the B1G opening a second conference office in Manhattan.</p>

<p>This could be the reason behind the B1G’s actions, retaliation for challenging their hold on the Northeast. It could also be retaliation for other actions as well such as the ACC being an opponent of satellite camps. Perhaps it is retaliation for allowing Notre Dame to join their conference as a non-football member.</p>

<p>There could also be more strategic forces at play here as well. Perhaps the B1G feels that the ACC’s intentions were with malice and they were planning on tailoring their system to guarantee Florida State and/or Clemson an easy conference schedule. It could also be a sneaky way to incorporate Notre Dame as a full football member without disrupting their other scheduling obligations with Navy, USC, and Stanford. Or maybe the Big Ten, which has historically been the most traditionalist of the P5, is afraid of a “no-divisions” setup so much that they don’t want to allow any conference implement it right now.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is the thought that should keep ACC fans up at night, what if Maryland isn’t the only ACC school the B1G is targeting and they are doing this as an attempt to destabilize the ACC?</p>

<p>It looks an awful lot like the B1G is the only culprit here, but it can not be omitted that the SEC was very quick to jump on board with the B1G. The reason I include the SEC is because this isn’t the first time the SEC has spurned the ACC. The SEC teamed up with the Big 12 to create a New Year’s Day bowl to rival the Rose Bowl. This left the ACC as the only P5 conference without such a bowl.</p>

<p>It is very easy to inject the same arguments I used with the Big Ten as to why the SEC considers the ACC an enemy. No two P5 conferences have more overlap in their conference footprint than the SEC and ACC. The SEC also has a history of chasing ACC schools. One of the reported SEC targets during the 2010-2013 conference realignment was Virginia Tech (VT).</p>

<p>What makes the reported interest in VT so compelling is that there is a strong belief that the SEC, a conference that is in recent years has been doing their best to copy the B1G, is putting a larger focus on academics in realignment than what was previously thought. For me personally, I find it hard to believe that the SEC would offer VT without first approaching Virginia, North Carolina, or possibly Duke as well a little far fetched which makes the “SEC academics” theory believable.</p>

<p>If you give the SEC the same conference realignment motives as the B1G in voting against total deregulation, it establishes a motive for the vote of every P5 conference (the Pac-12 abstained and was the only FBS conference to do so).</p>

<p>The best-case scenario for the ACC is that the conference is simply terrible at making friends. This statement is not meant as a joke. It follows a repeat pattern where the Big 12 constantly benefits from outside support, while the ACC is left to fend for itself.</p>

<p>One of the rumors regarding how the Big 12 managed to stay together following the loss of Colorado and Nebraska was “an influential group of outsiders” that was said to include fellow Power Conference administrators. The Big 12 also enjoyed generous support from the TV executives to keep the conference stable whereas the TV executives can hardly be portrayed as helpful to the stability of the ACC. On top of that the ACC more often than not, seems to find themselves politically isolated from the rest of the P5, whereas the other P5 conferences have been quick to come to the aid of the Big 12.</p>

<p>So whether the CCG vote has to do with conference realignment, or having no friends, the ACC’s decision to propose an amendment to ban satellite camps (which is a direct shot at the B1G) certainly doesn’t dispel the notion that there is a feud between the two conferences.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The ACC is in a politically vulnerable situation right now. They are in one of the following predicaments: A full scale feud with the Big Ten, they literally have no friends, or the Big Ten or SEC are trying to destabilize them.</p>

<p>This is from the BBC six-part series, <em>Stephen Fry in America</em>, which was filmed in 2007-08.  It&#39;s truly wonderful; his very English perspective and quiet humanity is absolutely charming to an American.  You can watch all the episodes on YouTube:</p>

<p>Terminology in football isn&#39;t universal, and there is a lot of confusion out there about different types of positions.  Like what is a runningback vs. a tailback vs. a halfback.  These charts should help break it down.</p>

<p>Also, check out the position breakdown section of <a href="/r/footballstrategy">/r/footballstrategy</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/footballstrategy/wiki/index#wiki_position_breakdowns">wiki page</a></p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What to know what&#39;s going to happen next week?  The rest of the season?   We all know that history repeats itself, so looking at the past is the surest way to predict the future.</p>

<p>The following is how teams have done all-time after starting with the record they have now. To make it clear, these are the game results of games that happened after they reached their current record in those years.</p>

<p>The columns represent school, their current record, the last time they had the record, how they did the rest of the season after getting the record, and the record they have at their current record.</p>

<p>This week, per a suggestion by <a href="/u/TheTruthIsInTheY">/u/TheTruthIsInTheY</a>, I have added columns for best finish when starting with this record and worse finish.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Surprise! The 2017 college football season was really just the qualifying campaign for the NCAA&#39;s new FIFA inspired tournament of champions. The CFB Playoffs last year? We&#39;ll call that the Confederations Cup. The regular season? Regional qualifying. Out-of-conference games? Let&#39;s say those were international friendlies that counted towards qualifying. I&#39;m gonna bend the rules a lot to make this work.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The format of this CFWC will follow the new 2026 WC format, with 48 teams qualifying and 32 of them moving on to the single-elimination knockout rounds. But first, how many bids does each region (conference) get to the CFWF? Let&#39;s use the average ranking from the post-season CBS 130 Rankings to gauge how well each region finished. And who&#39;s hosting? Well I looked forward to where the 2019 National Championship Game is being hosted, and it&#39;s Levi Stadium in Santa Clara! The Bay Area has two CFB teams that matter (sorry SJSU), so California has been chosen as the host of the first ever College Football World Cup!</p>

<p>Some notes before we continue: Idaho was kicked out of FBS because they literally couldn&#39;t find a sober person in Moscow to coach the team and New Mexico State was kicked out of the Sun Belt when everyone realized that they&#39;re like 500 miles away from the actual Sun Belt. Neither team qualified anyway.</p>

<h1>Bids</h1>

<p>I did some math based on region size and average ranking, and here&#39;s what I came up with for bids:</p>

</tr>

<p>The next part is the most controversial one: which teams deserve to make it from each conference? I attempted to determine it from overall record and then conference record, taking head-to-head results into account. Some of you will hate me because your team should&#39;ve played better in conference. Wah wah.</p>

<p><strong>SEC</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>Auburn</li>
<li>LSU</li>
<li>South Carolina</li>
<li>Mississippi State</li>
<li>Kentucky</li>
<li>Missouri</li>
</ol>

<p>The &quot;Confederations Cup&quot; champion and runner up top the group. Perennial powerhouses Auburn and LSU are next, followed by SCAR and Mississippi State, with Kentucky and Missouri slipping into the last two spots. Sorry Texas A&amp;M, you are the Dutch of this College Football World Cup. Maybe in four years.</p>

<p><strong>ACC</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Miami</li>
<li>NC State</li>
<li>Virginia Tech</li>
<li>Wake Forest</li>
<li>Boston College</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
</ol>

<p>Clemson and Miami are legitimate threats to go all the way. NC State and Virginia Tech are riding the hype train until it goes off the rails, as usual. Wake Forest and Boston College sneak in as upset threats, and Louisville rides on the back of Lamar Jackson into the tournament. Sorry Florida State, your in-conference record was ass and you had to reschedule a game cancelled by a hurricane just to keep your bowl streak alive. You and Southern Miss are both missing this tournament.</p>

<p><strong>Big Ten</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wisconsin</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Penn State</li>
<li>Northwestern</li>
<li>Michigan State</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no debate about Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Penn State - they deserve to be here. Michigan State and Northwestern are quietly two of the best teams in the Big Ten, each achieving ten win seasons. Jim Harbaugh and Michigan ride into the tournament on a winning conference record and a fresh pair of khakis. Sorry Iowa, you cannot into CFWC.</p>

<p><strong>Pac-12</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>USC</li>
<li>Washington</li>
<li>Stanford</li>
<li>Washington State</li>
<li>Arizona State</li>
<li>Arizona</li>
</ol>

<p>Sam Darnold leads USC into the tournament, with Coach Pete and Washington close behind. The Cardinal ride in on Bryce Love&#39;s shoulders, while Luke Falk literally destroys his body and potential NFL career to get WSU in. The state of Arizona squeaks in on winning in-conference records. Sorry Utah, UCLA, and Oregon. Utah may have been the only Pac-12 team to win a bowl, but their measly 3-6 in-conference record doesn&#39;t deserve a spot. UCLA misses out, but Josh Rosen is busy at home being an &quot;entitled millennial&quot; anyway. (Also I&#39;m not sorry about Oregon, you suck).</p>

<p><strong>Big XII</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>TCU</li>
<li>Oklahoma State</li>
<li>Iowa State</li>
<li>Kansas State</li>
<li><del>West Virginia</del></li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest surprise here is that Iowa State comes in at the fourth spot. Powerhouses OU, TCU, and OSU lead the group with always consistent Kansas State and uber-talented but often injured and inconsistent WVU also included. Texas status: not back.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>I originally said the Big XII would only have five bids, and I accidentally added WVU at the expense of North Texas out of C-USA. I added UNT back and just left WVU since I already simmed everything. For the Texas fans, the Big XII site has them above WVU, so technically they would make it, but only on my oversight. My bad.</em></p>

<p><strong>American</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>UCF</li>
<li>USF</li>
<li>Memphis</li>
<li>Houston</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry Navy &amp; SMU, Houston edged you out in conference. UCF is hoping to continue its undefeated streak and possibly claim a legitimate national title. Quinton Flowers and USF will turn heads as they seek more postseason glory. Memphis has explosive talent and a potent offense that will score major points, as long as their defense isn&#39;t on the field too much.</p>

<p><strong>Mountain West</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Boise State</li>
<li>Fresno State</li>
<li>SDSU</li>
</ol>

<p>Only the Sun Belt has less teams in the Top 100. Fresno State shocked everyone by qualifying ahead of SDSU after going 1-11 in 2016. The Broncos and Aztecs are no strangers to being on top of this conference. Boise State looks to prove again that it is the undisputed king of the Group of 5 conferences.</p>

<p><strong>Independent</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Notre Dame</li>
<li>Army</li>
</ol>

<p>New Mexico State is hoping for a strong 2021 campaign to qualify from this anti-geographical region. Notre Dame is going to be to Independents what New Zealand will be to Oceania in future FIFA World Cups. Army charges in on the back of the triple option.</p>

<p><strong>Conference USA</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>FAU</li>
<li>North Texas</li>
</ol>

<p>The Lane Train and the Mean Green get a shot at glory. UAB almost surprised everyone and qualified. Most casual CFB fans probably can&#39;t name any other teams in C-USA.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>I&#39;m an actual piece of trash and forgot to include UNT in the simulation because I was educated at Boise State and only had to count to 48 when Kellen Moore played here. I added them to Group A (the easiest one) and re-ran the sim. I&#39;m sorry Mean Green fans.</em></p>

<p><strong>MAC</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Toledo</li>
<li>Akron</li>
</ol>

<p>If Toledo and Akron could join forces, rocket-powered kangaroos could mix things up a bit. Unfortunately, they&#39;ll have to compete separately. Good luck, MAC.</p>

<p><strong>Sun Belt</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Troy</li>
<li>Appalachian State</li>
</ol>

<p>Troy quietly went 11-2 during the qualifying campaign and will hope to turn some heads with a group stage upset. Does App State still have upset magic in them as well?</p>

<h1>Pots</h1>

<p>There you have it - the teams that will be competing for the first ever College Football World Cup! Next, we have to sort the teams into groups based on strength and region. There will be 16 groups labelled A through P, with a team from each pot. Pots are determined by CBS Rankings. Cal is automatically assigned Pot 1 status and placed in the first position in Group A.</p>

<h1>Groups</h1>

<p>Now for group selection! Teams were sorted into groups using a random letter generator for A-P. Random letters sometimes had to be regenerated so that no group had two teams from the same region.</p>

<p>And now it&#39;s time for the final simulation! Games were simulated at least ten times with the average score used for the final result. Some groups relied on score differential to decide who moved into the elimination round! Opponents play each other once with the top two teams advancing. Each team plays one &quot;home&quot; and one &quot;away&quot; game. I had to re-run Group A with North Texas added because I am a cotton-headed ninnymuggins, so their format follows the current World Cup.</p>

<h1>Group Stage</h1>

<p><strong>Group A Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>USF defeats California, 35-17</li>
<li>North Texas defeats Army, 33-19</li>
<li>California defeats Army, 30-20</li>
<li>USF defeats North Texas, 30-21</li>
<li>California defeats North Texas, 28-24</li>
<li>USF defeats Army, 27-20</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group A Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>USF (9 pts)</li>
<li>California (6 pts)</li>
<li>North Texas (3 pts)</li>
<li>Army (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>USF charges through in arguably the easiest group, with California stopping Army&#39;s run game and taking the second spot. Army goes home with the satisfaction of being the only military academy to qualify for the tournament. North Texas opens with a solid win over Army, but cannot repeat over USF or Cal. Again, my apologies to the Mean Green fans for forgetting about you and having to add this later.</p>

<p><strong>Group B Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Wisconsin defeats LSU, 23-17</li>
<li>Wisconsin defeats Kansas State, 30-13</li>
<li>LSU defeats Kansas State, 28-15</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group B Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wisconsin (6 pts)</li>
<li>LSU (3 pts)</li>
<li>Kansas State (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Kansas State&#39;s defense just can&#39;t stop Wisconsin and LSU as they comfortably advance.</p>

<p><strong>Group C Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Notre Dame defeats Virginia Tech, 35-10</li>
<li>Notre Dame defeats Toledo, 33-27</li>
<li>Virginia Tech defeats Toledo, 25-21</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group C Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Notre Dame (6 pts)</li>
<li>Virginia Tech (3 pts)</li>
<li>Toledo (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Toledo somehow holds Notre Dame closer than Virginia Tech, but ultimately fails. The Fighting Irish are rolling.</p>

<p><strong>Group D Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Auburn defeats Michigan State, 26-14</li>
<li>Auburn defeats Arizona State, 30-15</li>
<li>Michigan State defeats Arizona State, 26-19</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group D Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Auburn (6 pts)</li>
<li>Michigan State (3 pts)</li>
<li>Arizona State (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Pac-12 failing in the postseason? No real surprises here.</p>

<p><strong>Group E Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TCU defeats Washington State, 33-18</li>
<li>Houston defeats TCU, 26-25</li>
<li>Washington State defeats Houston, 31-21</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group E Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>TCU (+14) (3 pts)</li>
<li>Washington State (-5) (3 pts)</li>
<li>Houston (-9) (3 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first big surprise! Houston holds off TCU but eventually gets eliminated on score differential after Luke Falk &amp; the Fighting Leaches decides that Pullman needs a happy reason to drink (for once).</p>

<p><strong>Group F Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Washington defeats NC State, 23-14</li>
<li>Washington defeats Appalachian State, 24-20</li>
<li>NC State defeats Appalachian State, 29-15</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group F Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Washington (6 pts)</li>
<li>NC State (3 pts)</li>
<li>Appalachian State (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Washington saw that Washington State placed second in Group E and it became inevitable that a replay of the Apple Cup would occur in the first elimination round. Appalachian State keeps it fairly close but NC State wins it for Tar Heel State bragging rights.</p>

<p><strong>Group G Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>USC defeats South Carolina, 25-21</li>
<li>USC defeats Akron, 27-11</li>
<li>South Carolina defeats Akron, 31-3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group G Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>USC (6 pts)</li>
<li>South Carolina (3 pts)</li>
<li>Akron (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a game to decide who the real USC is, the Trojans win late to stave off the SEC. Akron loses both games on their way to becoming the worst performer of the tournament. Womp womp.</p>

<p><strong>Group H Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Oklahoma defeats Northwestern, 44-18</li>
<li>Oklahoma defeats Boston College, 43-22</li>
<li>Northwestern defeats Boston College, 22-11</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group H Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Oklahoma (6 pts)</li>
<li>Northwestern (3 pts)</li>
<li>Boston College (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Baker Mayfield grabs his crotch at least five times as Oklahoma outscore first round opponents 87-40. Northwestern shows that they deserve to be here.</p>

<p><strong>Group I Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Oklahoma State defeats Memphis, 41-27</li>
<li>Missouri defeats Oklahoma State, 35-28</li>
<li>Missouri defeats Memphis, 40-28</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group I Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Missouri (6 pts)</li>
<li>Oklahoma State (3 pts)</li>
<li>Memphis (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Missouri somehow exceeds expectations and win the group. The Memphis defense couldn&#39;t get off the field.</p>

<p><strong>Group J Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Georgia defeats Louisville, 39-16</li>
<li>Georgia defeats Michigan, 29-12</li>
<li>Michigan defeats Louisville, 23-22</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group J Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Georgia (6 pts)</li>
<li>Michigan (3 pts)</li>
<li>Louisville (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Georgia scorches through to the next round. Lamar Jackson goes home early because Harbaugh FINALLY does something right.</p>

<p><strong>Group K Scores</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ohio State defeats Wake Forest, 34-15</li>
<li>Ohio State defeats Fresno State, 35-16</li>
<li>Wake Forest defeats Fresno State, 29-16</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group K Results</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Ohio State (6 pts)</li>
<li>Wake Forest (3 pts)</li>
<li>Fresno State (0 pts)</li>
</ol>

<p>Cinderella story Fresno State gets on the board in both games, but ultimately can&#39;t compete with Power 5 talent and coaching. You&#39;ll get &#39;em next time, Tedford.</p>

<p>Stanford and Miami play a close one. Neither falls to the same fate that LSU did during the regular season. This kills the Troy.</p>

<h1>Round of 32</h1>

<p><strong>A1 vs. B2 -</strong> LSU defeats USF, 28-21</p>

<p>The Bulls&#39; dreams come to an end here after a close loss to LSU. Geaux Tigahs.</p>

<p><strong>C1 vs. D2 -</strong> Notre Dame defeats Michigan State, 31-14</p>

<p>The Spartans just can&#39;t stop Brandon Wimbush in this classic matchup as the Irish continue rolling and increase their all time series lead.</p>

<p><strong>E1 vs. F2 -</strong> TCU defeats NC State, 25-18</p>

<p>The Horned Frogs comfortably win as Ryan Finley throws 17 interceptions but still gets Heisman mentions for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>G1 vs. H2 -</strong> USC defeats Northwestern, 32-17</p>

<p>Sam Darnold is looking like the 2018 Cleveland Browns starting quarterback.</p>

<p><strong>I1 vs. J2 -</strong> Missouri defeats Michigan, 27-18</p>

<p>Is there any better way for Harbaugh to go out other than losing to the worst SEC team in the tournament? He could almost smell the familiar confines of Levi&#39;s Stadium from here.</p>

<p><strong>K1 vs. L2 -</strong> Ohio State defeats Boise State, 38-14</p>

<p>Boise State keeps it close until halftime, but ultimately can&#39;t hold on. Ohio State pulls away as JT Barrett desperately petitions for a 29th year of eligibility.</p>

<p><strong>M1 vs. N2 -</strong> Mississippi State defeats FAU, 27-21</p>

<p>The Lane Train goes crashing off the rails as the Bulldogs steal a late win. Kiffin furiously tweets trash talk about the refs during the game.</p>

<p><strong>O1 vs. P2 -</strong> Alabama defeats Miami, 33-12</p>

<p>Nick Saban steals the turnover chain from the Miami sideline after the game and gives it to Satan as a sacrificial gift.</p>

<p><strong>B1 vs. A2 -</strong> Wisconsin defeats California, 32-13</p>

<p>The hosts perform admirably, but can&#39;t stop the Horniboi from throwing multiple TD bombs.</p>

<p><strong>D1 vs. C2 -</strong> Auburn defeats Virginia Tech, 34-9</p>

<p>Virginia Tech&#39;s stout defense lays down and dies during the game. Gus Malzahn has earned himself one more year.</p>

<p><strong>F1 vs. E2 -</strong> Washington defeats Washington State, 27-16</p>

<p>The city of Seattle has another reason to be smug. The city of Pullman has been drunk for several weeks and will be for several more. At least the Cougs didn&#39;t give up 41 this time.</p>

<p><strong>H1 vs. G2 -</strong> Oklahoma defeats South Carolina, 36-18</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield actually pulls his dick out in the endzone and sceams, &quot;THIS IS WHAT A REAL GAMECOCK LOOKS LIKE.&quot; The NCAA fines South Carolina for provoking him and his draft stock increases.</p>

<p><strong>J1 vs. I2 -</strong> Georgia defeats Oklahoma State, 36-20</p>

<p>The Dawgs are barking as Sony Michel and Nick Chubb each score a pair on the ground.</p>

<p><strong>L1 vs. K2 -</strong> UCF defeats Wake Forest, 32-23</p>

<p>The 2017 Unofficial National Champions of College Football keep the G5 dream alive.</p>

<p><strong>N1 vs. M2 -</strong> Penn State defeats Clemson, 22-15</p>

<p>In a match-up featuring Lions and Tigers (but thankfully no Bears), the Happy Valley squad proves that they&#39;re the fiercer cats.</p>

<p><strong>P1 vs. O2 -</strong> Stanford defeats Iowa State, 26-21</p>

<p>The Trees stand up to the Cyclones in a stadium with almost 14 Stanford fans in attendance.</p>

<h1>Round of 16</h1>

<p><strong>C1 vs. B2 -</strong> Notre Dame defeats LSU, 25-22</p>

<p>The Fighting Irish prove that it just doesn&#39;t mean more.</p>

<p><strong>E1 vs. G1 -</strong> TCU defeats USC, 28-26</p>

<p>Gary Patterson just keeps winning. Sam Darnold REALLY looked like the future <del>Browns</del> Jets QB in this one.</p>

<p><strong>I1 vs. K1 -</strong> Ohio State defeats Missouri, 33-22</p>

<p>Did you need another reason to hate Ohio State?</p>

<p><strong>O1 vs. M1 -</strong> Alabama defeats Mississippi State, 26-20</p>

<p>Mississippi State continues to be the only SEC team that can keep Alabama within one score. All of planet Earth wants the Bulldogs to pull the upset, but they fall short in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p><strong>B1 vs. D1 -</strong> Wisconsin defeats Auburn, 22-20</p>

<p>THE HORNIBOI CANNOT BE STOPPED. Gus Malzahn&#39;s future is uncertain again.</p>

<p><strong>H1 vs. F1 -</strong> Oklahoma defeats Washington, 32-24</p>

<p>Coach Pete cannot recreate his 2007 magic against Oklahoma. Baker Mayfield actually has to try in this game. Oklahoma doesn&#39;t call the stupidest plays ever created in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p><strong>J1 vs. L1 -</strong> Georgia defeats UCF, 40-21</p>

<p>UCF still claims a National Championship and Skip Bayless still thinks Georgia is overrated.</p>

<p><strong>N1 vs. P1 -</strong> Penn State defeats Stanford, 27-22</p>

<p>The Pac-12&#39;s last hope just falls short of a huge upset.</p>

<h1>Quarterfinals</h1>

<p><strong>C1 vs. E1 -</strong> Notre Dame defeats TCU, 29-21</p>

<p>WHAT IS IN THE WATER IN SOUTH BEND THIS SEASON?? TCU cannot mount a 4th quarter comeback because they&#39;re not playing against the Pac-12.</p>

<p><strong>K1 vs. O1 -</strong> Ohio State defeats Alabama, 26-24</p>

<p>The second most hated team in America defeats the most hated team in America. America drinks for several reasons.</p>

<p><strong>B1 vs. H1 -</strong> Oklahoma defeats Wisconsin, 29-27</p>

<p>THE HORNIBOI HAS BEEN STOPPED BY THE COCKYBOI.</p>

<p><strong>J1 vs. N1 -</strong> Georgia defeats Penn State, 32-15</p>

<p>WE&#39;VE GOT OURSELVES A SCORIGAMI FOLKS, SOMEBODY CALL JON BOIS! The Dawgs prove that two star running backs are better than one.</p>

<h1>Semifinals</h1>

<p><strong>K1 vs. C1 -</strong> Ohio State defeats Notre Dame, 28-25</p>

<p>JT Barrett is now older than most cardinals at Notre Dame, but manages to lead the Buckeyes to the promised land.</p>

<p><strong>H1 vs. J1 -</strong> Georgia defeats Oklahoma, 32-29</p>

<p>Sometimes reality writes the story better than fiction. Google &quot;2017 Rose Bowl Game&quot; for reference.</p>

<h1>Third Place Game</h1>

<p><strong>Oklahoma defeats Notre Dame, 33-30</strong></p>

<p>Baker Mayfield gets the last laugh as he drives down the field to set up the game winning field goal as time expires. He plants the OU flag at the 50 yard line after the game and gets yelled at on ESPN for several decades to follow.</p>

<h1>National Championship Game</h1>

<p><strong>Georgia defeats Ohio State, 26-23</strong></p>

<p>The Dawgs prevail, just like they should have in real life. JT Barrett retires after the game, citing old age and wanting to spend time with his children as his main reasons for hanging up the cleats. Georgia could lose every single game for the rest of eternity, but their fans will never let us forget this moment.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(330)">View full post</button><div id="330" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re gonna be hard-pressed to find a &quot;THE&quot; source to use, because there are so many flavors, types, and versions of the Air Raid.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>ELI5: Spread formations, hurry-up-no-huddle, flood the field with receivers.  Core concepts of the system: Mesh, 4-Verts, All-Hitches, Y-Stick, Y-Cross, Shallow, Y-Corner.</strong> </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>HOW DID WE GET THE AIR RAID?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mike Leach and Hal Mumme were both in love with the pass-happy BYU take of the West Coast Offense in the 1980&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>They wanted to design an offense that took concepts of the WCO, but simplify the system so that high schoolers could run it.</p></li>
<li><p>Leach always had a standing order or idea that you have three constants you have to maximize: Time, space, and personnel.  Time: Use the most of it by getting as many plays in as possible.  Space: Attack and send receivers to every point on the field.  Personnel: Make the most out of what you have by developing a system that allows weaker, or even slower and less talented players to compete.</p></li>
<li><p>When it came to time, Mumme and Leach wanted to embody &quot;basketball on grass,&quot; with the flow of their offense.  This is where the idea of using a hurry-up-no-huddle pace, and hyper-fast distribution of the ball to various points on the field came from.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE AIR RAID</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A pass-first, pass-heavy, simplified take on a few core WCO concepts.  The goal is to use time, space, and personnel: Stretch and threaten the entire field by stretching the defense out both pre-snap and post-snap and getting the ball wherever the defense is not (space).  Time in game: Get as many snaps in as possible to maximize scoring chances and to tire the defense.  Time in practice: Simplify the offense to spend more time developing players and perfecting the core concepts.  Personnel: Make it so any average kid-joe could run it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>No Huddle: Use short play names and simple signaling systems to get plays in fast, and snap the ball as fast as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Trimmed formations using primarily just 10 personnel (1RB, 0TE, 4WR), and occasionally 20 personnel (2RB, 0TE, 3WR).  Primarily formations were spread 2x2, 3x1, and 2x1.  The original system was ran under center, but by the 2000&#39;s had gone almost all shotgun.  </p></li>
<li><p>Simplified running game to maximize practice time on the pass game.  Pure/traditional Air Raid would carry maybe 2-3 run plays.  Something like zone, and draw.  </p></li>
<li><p>Supplement the reduced running game with a robust &quot;fast screen&quot; game (hitch, bubble, and swing screens) to create the &quot;outside run game.&quot;  </p></li>
<li><p>Pass protections were also reduced to just 1-3 total protections as opposed to the WCO.  The Air Raid is also noted for a technique called &quot;vertical set&quot; pass protection, meaning instead of making a traditional pocket, linemen would backpedal in sync with the QB&#39;s drop: 3-step drop = 3 backpedal steps.  5-step drop = 5 backpedal steps.  This method would force defensive stunts and blitzes to unfold before engaging with the O-line.  This also helped minimize the amount of time O-linemen had to be engaged with defenders before the ball was thrown (again, designed to help weaker or less-skilled linemen).</p></li>
<li><p>WIDE SPLITS!  Offensive linemen used very wide splits, with a minimum of 3-feet and sometimes getting as wide as 3-5 yards!  This pushed the pass rush farther away from the QB, and allowed smaller, shorter QB&#39;s (or prototype ones) to have more natural vision and passing lanes set up between the tackles.  It also allowed QB&#39;s, backs, and linemen to identify defensive players easier by forcing more space between them.  Another perk is that it allowed weaker or slower linemen to keep their defender farther from the QB and backs by alignment alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement some slow screens as change-ups or &quot;action fake&quot; type plays designed to be PA, fake quick screens, etc.  This is where you see things like the RB middle screen, or jailbreak/tunnel screens.</p></li>
<li><p>THROW TO GRASS!  QB reads on pass plays weren&#39;t focused on keying a specific defender or watching receivers.  QB&#39;s were instead taught to read land-marks or areas of grass.  The rule was if there&#39;s no defender in that area, throw it there.  If there is a defender in that area, look to the next area.  This is really where Leach&#39;s madness of &quot;space&quot; utilization comes alive.  The idea was throw the ball wherever the defense wasn&#39;t.  Receivers then had to get there.  </p></li>
<li><p>Pass routes were usually fixed, or pre-snap adjustments based on the way the defense lined up.  Few, if any option routes once the ball was snapped.  He relied heavily on trusting QB&#39;s to throwing to open areas, and that receivers had to be responsible for being there.</p></li>
<li><p>One other pass progression change from the West Coast was to take the &quot;alert&quot; routes (chance or deep shot routes not part of the original progression) and put them into the actual progression, meaning almost every Air Raid concept starts with the QB looking at a deep shot route.  Not all Air Raid coaches do this though, and many still use the &quot;alert&quot; pre-snap approach.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE CORE CONCEPTS:</strong></p>

<p>There are seven core concepts or plays in the Air Raid (at least that&#39;s what most cases I&#39;ve seen have been).  Obviously you aren&#39;t limited to these, nor do you have to run these seven, but these are the seven most popular concepts associated with the system.  You can google and find info on all of these concepts if you&#39;re looking for diagrams to show people:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mesh</p></li>
<li><p>All Hitches</p></li>
<li><p>Y-Stick</p></li>
<li><p>Y-Cross</p></li>
<li><p>Shallow</p></li>
<li><p>Y-Corner</p></li>
<li><p>4-Verticals</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Many consider Mesh and 4-verticals to be the two &quot;must have&quot; concepts if you want to be an Air Raid team.  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE WHOLE PICTURE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>7 base/hall-mark pass concepts (there&#39;s definitely more)</p></li>
<li><p>2-3 run plays</p></li>
<li><p>2-4 fast screens</p></li>
<li><p>1-3 slow screens</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s basically it.  The fast screens could be called as an entire play, or used as tags onto run plays.  This limited set of plays and concepts would then allow you to rep these plays over and over at a very fast pace.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>FORMATIONS</strong></p>

<p>X: Split-end or away-side end (opposite of Y)</p>

<p>Y: Tight-end or call-side end</p>

<p>Z: Flanker to Y side</p>

<p>H: Slot receiver</p>

<p>S: Scat-back (Leach term).  The RB was more of a receiving-type, and would frequently be in route.</p>

<p><strong>Right/Left (or no call, often with Y set to the right if so)</strong></p>

<p>X---------------O-O-X-O-O--------Y-----------</p>

<p>------H---------------------------------------Z--</p>

<p>-----------------------Q--S-------------------</p>

<p><strong>Early/Late (Leach terms for trips formations)</strong></p>

<p>Early = Right, Late = Left</p>

<p>X------------O-O-X-O-O-----Y------------</p>

<p>---------------------------------------H-----Z-</p>

<p>---------------------Q--S</p>

<p><strong>2x1 Formation (Don&#39;t remember what he called this one)</strong></p>

<p>X------------O-O-X-O-O-------Y---------</p>
