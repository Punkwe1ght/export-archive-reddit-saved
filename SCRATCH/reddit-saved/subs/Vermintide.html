<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>This is part one of the lore guide:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/8525k4/the_end_timesvermintide_lore_part_2_get_to_know/">Part two is here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/87stxo/the_end_timesvermintide_lore_part_3_the_end_of/">Part three is here</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>So for those picking up Vermintide 2 just now, and who are not yet familiar with the lore, here&#39;s a little background.</p>

<p><strong>The End Times:</strong></p>

<p>The game is titled &quot;Warhammer: The End Times&quot; because it takes place during the last days of the Warhammer fantasy world.</p>

<p>For millenia, many factions and lords vied for control of various parts of this world, until around year 2519 of the Imperial Calendar where Chaos and its allies became united and nearly unstoppable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Warriors of Chaos:</strong></p>

<p>There are four Chaos gods in the lore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Khorne - blood, war, battle</li>
<li>Tzeentch - sorcery, change, fate</li>
<li>Slaanesh - excess, sex, drugs, rock-n-roll</li>
<li>Nurgle - plague, disease, entropy</li>
</ul>

<p>You primarily face off against followers of Nurgle under the Rotblood Tribe. You&#39;ll notice how their sorcerers and Chaos spawns are bloated and ravaged by plagued; and their fodder of warriors are mostly emaciated and decrepit.</p>

<p>Because Warriors of Chaos are empowered by their chosen god, they rush headlong into battle, and will never shy away from a fight.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Skaven:</strong></p>

<p>The other primary antagonists of course are the Vermintide - the Skaven horde. Most of the clan rats you face off are members of Clan Fester, however there are some additions from other clans:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clan Moulder = experimenting in genetic manipulation and splicing; Rat Ogres</li>
<li>Clan Skryre = technological advancements; you&#39;ll see this in the Skittergate portal, Ratling Gunners, and Poison Wind Globadiers</li>
<li>Clan Eshin = specializing in assassinations and cunning tactics; in-game as Gutter Runners</li>
<li>Clan Pestilens = mixing it up among Nurgle&#39;s followers are rats that are diseased and plague-ridden; seen as Plague Monks</li>
<li>C-C-Combo Clans = there&#39;s one particular unit that combines the specializations of two clans and that&#39;s the Stormfiend (combining the ingenuity of Clan Skryre and the sadism of Clan Moulder)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Skaven worship the Great Horned Rat (who, in the <em>end</em> of the End Times ascended as a Chaos God himself).</p>

<p>Even with the blessings of the Great Horned Rat, Skaven, by nature, are very timid and easily frightened creatures, relying mostly to overwhelm enemies as a swarm as opposed to one-versus-one fighting. That&#39;s why it&#39;s common to see them hesitate or look fearful for a split-second when they&#39;re about to be attacked.</p>

<p>However, be warned - there are billions of them living underground. Known as &quot;The Under-Empire&quot; - the Skaven have built entire habitats underneath actual human cities, tribal villages, dwarfen strongholds, and elven castles.</p>

<p>They are cunning and vile, genius yet totally insane - to the point that it scares other races to think that such creatures are capable of both ruthlessness and intelligence, and downright stupidity and treachery to boot. Because they are untrusting and timid creatures, they&#39;re more likely to war with each other than against most of the races above-ground... but should they unite... well... now that&#39;s a scary thought...</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Vermintide 1:</strong></p>

<p>So The End Times begins around 2519 IC in the official lore. This coincides with certain events that kickstart the entire end of the world such as civil wars, beings attaining godly power, and so on.</p>

<p>However - the first game takes place around 2523 IC - four years after preliminary events have taken place.</p>

<p>This is around the time that the Skaven have invaded the outlying towns of The Empire.</p>

<p>The Skaven, as mentioned, are easily frightened and are cowardly creatures. Their own race are their worst enemy, and it&#39;s more common for them to backstab one another rather than uniting. But The End Times changed all that - as these man-sized rats who have built a massive empire under the earth itself have mostly united. It was <em>their</em> time.</p>

<p>The Skaven began attacking Imperial towns in what seemed to be minor raids, and later on revealed to be a massive invasion of dark forces.</p>

<p>The five heroes travel to an Imperial town called Ubersreik and survived the carnage.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Heroes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Marcus Kruber = Imperial Soldier - Kruber is an enlisted combatant in The Empire&#39;s army (known for their halberts and spears, and fancy hats)</li>
<li>Viktor Saltzpyre = Witch Hunter - Saltzpyre is an ardent follower of the Sigmarite faith of The Empire</li>
<li>Sienna Fuegonasus = Bright Wizard - Sienna is a wizard specializing in the Wind of Flame (Aqshy), and has learned her lessons from The Empire&#39;s magical colleges</li>
<li>Bardin Gorrekson = Dwarf Ranger - Bardin is from the dwarfen holds near the Grey Mountains</li>
<li>Kerillian = Wood Elf Waywatcher - Kerillian is one of the elusive wood elf folk living in the nearby forest of Athel Loren</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the basic canon of Vermintide 1.</p>

<p>However, in Vermintide 2, you can choose &quot;careers&quot; - or essentially - a new (head)&#39;canon&#39; path for your heroes to take. Careers offer a short backstory as to why a certain hero changed their playstyle or preferences after the first game.</p>

<p>For instance, Sienna as an &quot;Unbound&quot; meant that she has fully embraced Aqshy, and has become empowered and addicted to it. Kerillian as a &quot;Shade&quot; mentions that she had an ancestor who may have belonged to the Dark Elves/Druchii, specializing in assassinations. Bardin as a &quot;Slayer&quot; tells a story of how he had failed in his duties thus seeking redemption, focusing on melee ferocity in search of a heroic death.</p>

<p>These career paths are mostly mentioned in the Vermintide website and the characters may have a slight change in dialogue depending on the career chosen (ie. when activating their super, Saltzpyre&#39;s lines will be different depending on his chosen career).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Vermintide 2:</strong></p>

<p>The heroes were captured at the end of Vermintide 1 and are about to be sacrificed. They see a Skittergate Warp Portal bringing in thousands of Warriors of Chaos reinforcements. Because it&#39;s Skaven-made technology, it backfires, killing a lot of enemy warriors and allowing your heroes to escape.</p>

<p>The game is set roughly after the end of the first game, and this time around, we&#39;re told of more devastation occurring all throughout The Empire.</p>

<p>The fortress city of Helmgart near the Grey Mountains has been destroyed, and many more towns are laid to waste. The Skaven of Clan Fester have allied themselves with the Warriors of Chaos of the Rotblood Tribe in a <em>Dark Pact</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Canonically, the forces of Chaos and the Skaven did ally during The End Times.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>So, the world does end?</strong></p>

<p>Yes it did - but it won&#39;t happen until a few years after the events depicted in the game.</p>

<p>Canonically, the forces of Order (or basically the good/neutral/does not want to destroy the world) guys banded together to stop Chaos/Skaven/Beastmen.</p>

<p>You had Humans of The Empire, Kislev, Bretonnia, and minor territories, allied with Dwarfs, allied with all three elven factions (Wood elf, Dark elf, High elf), allied with the Lizardmen, allied with the forces of the Undead Legion of Nagash...</p>

<p>They were up against the combined might of the Four Gods of Chaos - corrupted men and daemons, the Beastmen, and the Skaven.</p>

<p>The Skaven Vermintide, united and given purpose, have become too much to handle for many mortal kingdoms - as they laid waste to cities and strongholds that have stood for many centuries.</p>

<p>The &quot;Good Guys&quot; attempted channel the Winds of Magic to close a Chaos rift, but a traitorous and petty vampire named &quot;Mannfred the Manchild&quot; (yes, that is his REAL name in the lore) put a stop to that.</p>

<p>The rift imploded, causing Chaos to enter the world as an unstoppable and enveloping energy, until the world was scoured of life.</p>

<p>But that... is a story... for Vermintide 5&#39;s 3rd DLC: &quot;Mannfred&#39;s Revenge&quot;.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know QP is basically meant for queueing up with random players and there is nothing wrong with that. But if you start a game with a premade of four then enforcing public games is beyond retarded.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the games fault or Steam servers acting up, but connection hasn&#39;t been too stable for us the last days. And if a player drops because of that the game relentlessly invites random people to fill the slots. </p>

<p>So either the person can&#39;t return or we have to keep kicking people out. This really needs to be adressed, as it is aggravating for everyone involved.</p>

<p>That said if i want to get to slayer im going to give ironbreaker a go. So any advice you all can give about playing the ironbreaker and tanking in general along with his talents would be appriciated thanks.</p>

<hr/>

<p>How to play 101:</p>

<p>Priority 1) Peel/defend for your team with block+push+block attack. Hold right mouse button, tap left mouse button to push away enemies from team. Hold Left tap after push to perform quick attack.</p>

<p>Priority 2) Keep your stam up with power attacks interwoven. l10 talent point gives you regen of you shields, use this inbetween pushes to keep your blocks up. Dodge backwards, then do a charged melee attack forward into another block+push+blockattack.</p>

<p>Priority 3) Choke points - pull out your ranged drakecannon in chokes to annihilate hordes. Only do this when your team doesn&#39;t need peels, and your team is generally safe. Charge up the drakecannon for 3-4 ticks with RMB+hold then hold LMB to release. Press R to vent when needed, but it&#39;s often not required.</p>

<p>Your job is to protect your team. You are their guard. You also melt armored target with powered and quick attacks with your axe, and can stagger armored targets with your shield bash when you have high POWER on your gear, this includes chaos warriors. Do this.</p>

<p>WHEN TO PRESS F (career taunt ability)? When shit hits the fan, usually when your emo archer, grandma firefingers or blind hunter shoots a very easy to avoid patrol pack of chaos or skaven. Get right in the middle with good placement and taunt. Hold block, watch your rear to make sure you don&#39;t get surrounded. If taunt wears off and you can&#39;t move, you&#39;re as good as dead. Also, be careful with your pushes, you can take damage while the push animation is going and get killed VERY quickly. </p>

<p>Other times might be to taunt the horde off your dainty elf that&#39;s run ahead and died to 1 infantry rat, but is now swarmed. Taunt, hold block, then press E to res without getting interrupted (does not work against bosses or LARGE hits).</p>

<p>GL &amp; Enjoy.</p>

<h2>Verminsurance: A look at Zealot and Handmaiden</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/firef1end </span>
<span class = "numcomments">122 comments </span>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/87didz/verminsurance_a_look_at_zealot_and_handmaiden/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('87didz')">View full post</button>
<div id="87didz" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><strong>Zealot</strong> and <strong>Handmaiden</strong> are two careers I&#39;m far too often seeing misunderstood and undervalued. A lot of people seem to assume that Handmaiden is some sort of bad tank and that Zealot is... well they aren&#39;t sure. What I&#39;m here to let you know is exactly what they are.<br/>
They are insurance.<br/>
<em>&quot;But what is insurance?&quot;</em><br/>
Well one thing to notice right of the bat, is that both of these careers are pretty hard to kill right? They&#39;re not frontline tanks, but they fit a survival archetype. They&#39;re supposed to save your run.<br/>
<em>&quot;So what are they supposed to do?&quot;</em><br/>
They&#39;re supposed to survive. That&#39;s about it. Both of their kits are designed to keep them in the fight for as long as possible, then allow them to get out if it&#39;s too far gone. Just slap a tome and a grim on these guys and watch them cling on for dear life.<br/>
The key to their success is their independence. They are both well geared to surviving on their own, hence their performance in solo runs. This is why they are often portrayed as off or mixed tanks. But don&#39;t be fooled.</p>

<h2>Zealot</h2>

<p>The first of our survivalists, and the more offensive of the two. Zealot is built more to hit lots of things quickly to stay alive. With a (broken) passive that increases his damage at low hp, the ability to cheat death and a few defensive skills, zealot is meant to stay in the fight to the last second, dealing more damage as more shit hits the fan, trying to fix whatever has gone wrong through shear damage. Then once his cheat death procs and everything has gone to hell he has the ability to get out of there.<br/>
Slap a rapier and a repeater xbow on this guy and you&#39;ll have a great all rounder who shines in being not dead. The ability to kite and kill helps him teeter on the edge of life long enough to hopefully rescue a couple teammates and bring the run back into one piece.<br/>
Of course he isn&#39;t invincible, and you shouldn&#39;t treat him like he is. When playing zealot you will hopefully be playing a midline role. Helping out the frontline when things get heavy, and sniping elites and specials before they get too close. As an all rounder you definitely don&#39;t want to be in the backline, as you don&#39;t have the snipe potential or ammo capacity to consistently take out any danger you can spot. You also don&#39;t want to commit to the frontline unless you have to as then you&#39;re committing your insurance to the fight.</p>

<h3>Handmaiden</h3>

<p>Here we have the defensive survivalist, often mistaken as a weird tank. In reality handmaiden acts more as a reactive clutch in fights. Working well to keep everyone alive as long as possible, giving them increased stamina regen to keep them blocking and pushing as long as possible, an uninterruptable revive to ensure they get back in the fight, and the most powerful movement ability in the game to ensure her own survival. I&#39;m going to be treating handmain&#39;s lvl 25 talent, that gives her invisibility for 3 seconds (which i think should be a part of the base dash, albeit in a weaker form), as an integral and required part of her kit.<br/>
Give her a spear and a longbow and she&#39;ll struggle to die. With a defensive weapon with incredible mobility, one of the best special killing weapons in the game and a 3 second window where nothing even recognises her existence, handmaiden can really take on the world. Pair that with a 50% damage reduction when the last hero standing and you have yourself the queen of clutch.<br/>
Handmaiden also loves the midline, being able to snipe with almost the capacity of the waystalker, but missing the longevity of regen, handmaiden has an easy time picking off an pesky elites or specials trying to mess up your day.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>These two careers are adept at survival. The best in the game. Better than tanks because while they generally can&#39;t take as much damage, they can get out of those situations and keep on surviving through the worst of it. Bring one of these guys if you want someone to help counter rng, and to keep a run alive if you aren&#39;t sure you&#39;ll make it. While they won&#39;t solo skittergate from start to finish for you, they&#39;ll make a run a lot more failproof. If you&#39;d rather to every fight to the last man in hopes of finishing full books or nothing, then by all means bring more offense. Just don&#39;t devalue these two amazing careers when they can&#39;t frontline tank as hard as, well, frontline tanks.
These guys are good candidates for natural bond, due to their innate survivability, and good book carriers too. Play these guys if you want to feel like you can take on the world until that leech drags you into the horde as you duck under the gutter runner to shoot the packmaster coming at you through that troll.</p>
