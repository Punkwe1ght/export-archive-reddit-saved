<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I pretty enjoy the concept of minimalism and only having as little clothes as possible however I also like streetwear, I&#39;m Italian but I really love parisian and French streetwear and the fact that they make such great outfits look effortless, same as Italians do with formal wear haha. </p>

<p>So basically I&#39;m trying to get people to make a wardrobe of only like 10 items of clothing, depending on season it requires a lot of thought and allows you to only buy pieces that you really love, so I guess it eliminates gimmicky pieces such as shark hoodies and bogo hoodies, boring outfits basically. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to see what 10 items you guys would choose for S/S or A/W depending on what you&#39;re at, I&#39;m still not sure what I&#39;d choose so I&#39;m not gonna give a list yet, you can probably go over by like 20 percent if things are really hard so like 12 items instead of 12, but yeah it&#39;s an interesting concept and it focuses on allowing you to only buy longer lasting high quality pieces as compared to buying on a whim. </p>

<p>Also if anyone has the time could they possibly create a parisian/European streetwear guide year could possibly go on the sidebar? Or inspo album, it&#39;s a really cool style as it&#39;s like more streetwear but it could still be seen as idk what the word is classy I guess, lots of black and white, striped shirts all that good stuff </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>Warning: Streetwear is, by definition, a subjective sense of style. You might not agree with everything posted in here and there isn&#39;t a definitive way you should dress.</em></p>

<p><em>Second Warning: Most of this guide was written while I was stoned to the bone. That being said, it still turned out better than some of the other guides posted recently, if I do say so myself.</em></p>

<p><em>I made this a few weeks ago and have been meaning to post this for a while but long story short I haven&#39;t had internet at my house lately and my data plan was almost out so mobile wasn&#39;t an option.</em></p>

<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>Ok so it seems to be the current trendy thing to post half ass guides for this sub. However, this guide will <em>hopefully</em> not be one of those. I&#39;m by far not the best person to tell you how to dress but I believe I&#39;m more qualified than some people in this sub. I&#39;ve been keeping up with streetwear for nearly four years now and have been relatively active on this sub for around a year. That being said, remember a good bit of this will be opinion-based, like many of the guides on this sub. This guide is mainly directed towards more Spring/Summer looks considering that typical streetwear trends like goth ninja that heavily rely on layering aren’t really possible in warmer weather. I will try to link brands and products to help provide examples of what I’m talking about or products you could consider buying. In the process of making this guide, I decided to make any links imgur links to pictures of specific products to show the style of the item I’m talking about instead of linking to a place to buy that specific item. However I’m going to include a list of w2c each item in the comments.</p>

<p>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</p>

<p><strong>ESSENTIALS</strong></p>

<p><em>BASICS</em></p>

<p>When talking about streetwear, the term includes any simple, plain tee shirts, hoodies, crewnecks, etc. Basics typically don’t have any graphics or major branding. <a href="http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2415064&amp;amp;parentPage=family">However this is not</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/accessories/supreme-hanes-tagless-tees-3-pack">always the case.</a> Most people won’t spend much on basics individually, but tend to look for less expensive, high quality basics. Many people will recommend brands such as <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/us/men/tops.html">Uniqlo,</a> <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/subdepartment/MEN?Nr=4294866338">H&amp;M,</a> <a href="http://store.americanapparel.net/new_cat33157">American Apparel,</a> etc. I don’t have any personal experience with H&amp;M, so I can’t vouch for their quality, and I’ve heard mixed reviews. However, Uniqlo is my go-to for basics, simply based on the quality you get at such a great price. I typically avoid ordering from American Apparel just because I can’t afford to buy as much from there. If you don’t care as much about great quality and your basics lasting a long time, you can always stick to the classic <a href="http://www.hanes.com/hanes/men/t-shirts/all-tshirts">Hanes</a></p>

<p><em>SHIRTS</em></p>

<p>In streetwear, other than basic tee shirts, crewnecks, and hoodies, you should have a solid rotation of shirts. These could include <a href="http://www.themstrplan.com/product/the-three-sentries">graphic tees,</a> <a href="http://undefeated.com/apparel/tops/undefeated-undftd-block-tank">tanks,</a> <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/25-aloha-trefoil-shirt/S24561.html">button downs/ups,</a> <a href="http://winterlotus.com/collections/all/products/world-tour">baseball,</a> <a href="http://www.stussy.com/us/ist-football-jersey?color_item=210">football,</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/tops-sweaters/all-star-basketball-jersey">basketball,</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/tops-sweaters/striker-soccer-jersey">and even soccer jerseys.</a> Another popular style for the summer is the <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=35211267&amp;amp;parentid=SUGGESTIVE+SEARCH+RESULTS">mandarin or band collar.</a> Make sure you wear shirts that fit your body and body type. For instance, I never wear tanks or basketball jerseys because I have a “dad body” so they don’t look very good on me. I stick to graphic tees and short sleeve button ups with simple patterns/designs.</p>

<p>Jerseys play a huge part in streetwear. Also, it’s worth noting that many in the streetwear community recommend avoiding jerseys from actual sports teams. Stick to jerseys from designers/clothing brands. There’s nothing wrong with jerseys for real teams, they just belong on a court/field or in the stands.</p>

<p><em>PANTS/SHORTS</em></p>

<p>Everyone should have a few pairs of jeans in their wardrobe. I’d recommend having at least <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=34874677&amp;amp;category=M_APP_JEANS">one pair of dark blue,</a> <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=31964406&amp;amp;category=M_APP_JEANS">one pair of light wash,</a> <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=32071326&amp;amp;category=M_APP_JEANS">and one pair of black jeans.</a> If you feel like you need or want more jeans, you can get into the world of <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=16917882&amp;amp;category=M_APP_JEANS">raw denim</a> or <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=34483586&amp;amp;category=M_APP_JEANS">distressed jeans,</a> though it is usually much cheaper to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy4WnVa2dzQ">distress an old pair yourself.</a> Many people prefer their pants to have a <a href="http://nakedandfamousdenim.com/2014/03/05/weirdguy-charcoal-selvedge/?cat=203">tapered,</a> <a href="http://nakedandfamousdenim.com/2013/06/13/skinnyguy-broken-twill-selvedge/?cat=203">slim,</a> <a href="http://nakedandfamousdenim.com/2015/02/02/superskinnyguy-indigo-x-copper-twist-selvedge/?cat=203">or skinny</a> fit. Other than jeans, it’s usually a good idea to have at least one pair of <a href="http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=60604766&amp;amp;cp=1760781.1760810&amp;amp;ab=ln_men_cs_chinos&amp;amp;parentPage=family">chinos</a> or <a href="http://www.dickies.com/mens-clothing/mens-pants/Original-874reg-Work-Pant-874.jsp">work pants.</a></p>

<p>Many people also like their pants to <a href="http://nakedandfamousdenim.com/2014/10/01/stackedguy-indigo-power-stretch/?cat=203">stack</a> The best way to achieve this effect is to buy skinny pants or get your pants tapered (it’s usually recommended to a 6” opening at the ankle) and buy pants with an inseam around 4”-6” longer than your inseam length. An alternative to this method for “stacking” your pants is to buy <a href="http://shop.secondnarrow.com/products/second-narrow-j-cut-jeans">j-cut jeans.</a></p>

<p>In addition to a solid rotation of pants, you should also have some shorts for the warmer months. Some streetwear staples for shorts would be <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/11725?article=11725-K">sweatshorts,</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/shorts/chino-short">chino shorts,</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/shorts/jacquard-flowers-belted-short">shorts with prints and patterns,</a> <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/25-denim-shorts/S24529.html">and this year, even jorts seem to be gaining in popularity.</a></p>

<p><em>OUTERWEAR</em></p>

<p>It’s really not the best idea to wear heavy outerwear in the summer months because of increased heat and humidity. However, it it still recommended you keep a couple lightweight, versatile outerwear pieces somewhere in your rotation for rainy or windy days. I’d recommend something that is breathable, will break wind, and is waterproof or water resistant. Some popular styles for the summer are <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/windrunner-jacket/pid-721835/pgid-721834">just typical windbreakers,</a> <a href="http://onlynylives.com/item/tournament-coach-jacket--navy">coach jackets,</a> <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=34562330&amp;amp;category=SEARCH+RESULTS">anoraks,</a> <a href="http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=61552016&amp;amp;&amp;amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3146860.11896263">and denim trucker jackets.</a></p>

<p><em>ACCESSORIES</em></p>

<p>Accessories are a great way you can make your fits a little more personal. However, it is very easy to go overboard. As a general rule of thumb, you should look in the mirror wearing whatever accessories you think you want to wear for that day, then remove at least one accessory. Accessories typically include hats ( <a href="http://onlynylives.com/item/shore-5-panel--black">5 panels or “camp caps”</a> and <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/hats/vietnam-6-panel">baseball caps</a> are always popular ) and jewelry such as <a href="http://www.gshock.com/watches/Trending/GWM500F-1C">watches,</a> <a href="http://www.domobeads.com/collections/wood-bracelets/products/natural-bundle">bracelets,</a> <a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer15preview/accessories/supreme-playboy-gold-pendant">chains/pendants,</a> etc. Some other styles of hats that are still technically “streetwear” but many would consider “played out” are <a href="http://imgur.com/WO7O1NT">bucket hats</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/OgHoueh">snapbacks.</a> Other hats would include <a href="http://imgur.com/UbV48kI">boonies</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/WvcgGCl">beanies</a> If you live in an area that’s typically sunny during the warmer months, you should also have a nice pair of sunglasses to help protect your eyes. Many people will recommend Ray Ban <a href="http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/wayfarer/clv">wayfarers</a> or <a href="http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/clubmaster/clv">clubmasters.</a> However, there are many more options out there that are worth taking a look at. For instance, <a href="http://www.monocleorder.com/">Monocle Order</a> is a site run by a user on this sub <a href="/u/heresmyusername">/u/heresmyusername</a> that focuses on independent brands with high quality, stylish eyewear.</p>

<p><strong>SHOES</strong></p>

<p><em>SNEAKERS</em></p>

<p>There isn’t much to be said about sneakers that hasn’t been said before. I’d highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/32a9ih/a_guide_to_summer_shoes/">/u/cantaloupsareswell’s recent Guide to Summer Sneakers.</a> All I can really add to what he has already said is that it is a good idea to diversify your sneaker rotation as far as brands go (you don’t want all Nike/Asics/Adidas/whatever). You should also try to build a rotation with different styles of sneakers. This would include <a href="https://www.newbalance.com/pd/new-balance-997/M997.html#color=Navy_with_Grey&amp;amp;width=D">runners,</a> <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/M20324.html">tennis/court shoes,</a> and <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-force-1-shoe/pid-132595/pgid-404309">basketball/lifestyle shoes.</a></p>

<p><em>BOOTS</em></p>

<p>In addition to sneakers, it’s generally a good idea to have at least one pair of boots in your wardrobe. Popular styles are <a href="http://www.timberland.com/shop/mens-boots/mens-6-inch-premium-waterproof-boots-10061024">work boots</a> and <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/90827?article=90827-A">chelsea boots.</a> It is usually best to not wear shorts with boots, but we’ll discuss that more later.</p>

<p><strong>GRAILS</strong></p>

<p>A popular term in the streetwear community is “grail.” This refers to an item that someone deems difficult to obtain whether it be due to rarity or cost. However, this doesn’t mean you’ll never get your grails. You just have to be patient and save your money and eventually your grails will come up for sale at a good price. Some of the more common “grail” items are <a href="http://imgur.com/IcmRpuH">Supreme Box Logo hoodies,</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/X3mjsSJ">Bape Shark hoodies,</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/BVJfFsj">Rick Owens Geobaskets,</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/RJRRwOo">Raf Simons x Adidas Ozweego 2s,</a> and even stuff a that retails for a little less but has a high resale price due to demand like <a href="http://imgur.com/tfZ3jmL">Air Jordan 1 “Breds.”</a> In most cases, grails are more of a statement piece, meant to be the focus of the outfit or to be shown off. With that being said, it is typically best to wear neutral or muted colors for the rest of the outfit.</p>

<p><em>RESALE</em></p>

<p>You’re not always going to be able to cop items you want at the retail price. For instance, Supreme has drops every Thursday at 11:00am EST when it’s in their season. The entire collection for a season doesn’t drop at once. Instead they drop a few things each week for a few months then close the webstore for a while to prepare for the next season. More often than not, a few items releasing have “hype” around them. These items typically sell out quickly, sometimes in seconds due to people using bots and just all around swiftness. If you are unable to buy a piece from the webstore before it sells out, your two options are to 1. give up and move on or 2. find someone reselling that item. Resale prices are generally much higher than the retail price. For instance, a <a href="http://imgur.com/NtfZO4C">Supreme Box Logo tee</a> (which DO NOT release every season) would have a retail price of $32, but you’d be lucky to find a legit one for under $200, depending on condition. Typically, good places to find an item for resale are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>this subreddit</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/r/supremeclothing">/r/supremeclothing</a></p></li>
<li><p>eBay</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.grailed.com/">Grailed</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>REMEMBER TO ALWAYS GET A LC (LEGIT CHECK) BEFORE YOU PURCHASE AN ITEM EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO SAY IT’S LEGIT. NOTHING COULD HURT WORSE THAN GETTING SCAMMED OUT OF YOUR MONEY FOR A FAKE.</em></p>

<p><strong>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</strong></p>

<p>There’s more to streetwear than just having a dope wardrobe. A big part of it is being able to put that wardrobe together into fashionable, cohesive fits. Having several expensive/rare pieces really isn’t worth much if you <a href="http://imgur.com/Ws02Ip6.jpg">can’t work it into a fit well.</a> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The best advice I could give is to limit your loud pieces to only one per fit. “Loud” pieces could include pieces with bright colors, distracting prints or patterns, excessive branding, anything overly flashy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re wearing boots of any type, DO NOT wear shorts. High top sneakers with shorts are also not advised. The main reason for this is that it simply doesn&#39;t &quot;look right&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Pastel colors, particularly <a href="http://imgur.com/Shjl1Ha">pink,</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/aI1PaWT">blue,</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/6z1qZIP">mint green</a> are trendy this season. These would go best with lighter neutral colors like white, cream, beige, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Every fit doesn’t need a hat or a lot of accessorizing. However they can definitely improve a fit when used well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>If you need inspiration for your wardrobe, there are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WwRPj">plenty</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/LC6TT">of</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cfJWd">inspo</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gxksg">albums</a> on the sub. *Inspo albums are meant to provide inspiration for a general style. Not a “what should I wear with this one v specific item I’m thinking about getting?” or “look at the fades on all this raw denim.” There’s a ridiculous amount of shitty “inspo albums” on the sub too.</em></p>

<p><em>Hopefully this helps some of you get started in streetwear and developing your wardrobe</em></p>

<h2>Streetwear 'Guide' for the Larger</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/91365481 </span>
<span class = "numcomments">19 comments </span>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/339kmv/streetwear_guide_for_the_larger/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('339kmv')">View full post</button>
<div id="339kmv" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me preface this by saying if you are obese or severely overweight, it&#39;s still not entirely applicable. Having a really large or flabby stomach, manboobs, or an excessive amount of fat in one area will mean you need to tone a bit! I was 300 pounds last year and at that weight, you can&#39;t really choose how to dress. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is completely unnecessary but I have seen comments etc.. regarding this matter so figured a guide would help a little. </p>

<p>If you are like me and just big in general, here are the best brands//fit techniques I have used for awhile. My Ht/Wt is around 6ft1 and 200 lbs if that helps.</p>

<p>Also remember, if you are a solid XL-XXL, <em>ZARA AND H/M ARE RARELY OR ALMOST NEVER YOUR FRIENDS</em> </p>

<p><strong>Jeans:</strong> </p>

<p>(<em>Note:</em> Make sure all jeans you wear are tapered <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5257796be4b0824de7919723/526093b6e4b0b89d5122f686/526093c3e4b0b89d5122f6a6/1382061139566/Screen+Shot+2013-10-17+at+9.42.23+PM.png?format=750w">close to your ankle</a>, almost like a &#39;skinny&#39; cut rather than a slim one. Pinrolling on thicker denims can look weird with large legs as it creates tons of creases.) </p>

<p>For awhile I used to wear Gap or Tommy Hilfiger Jeans that were typically straight leg etc.. These jeans can make you actually appear larger than you are and look fairly &#39;unclean&#39; if that makes sense. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nudie: Nudie has great quality jeans, especially their selvedge denim, but beware of this as they are stiff and can end up looking like a boot cut almost. Make sure that you either size down or are prepared to take them to a tailer to have them tapered as they can be a bit wide at the ankle, even with slim cuts. </p></li>
<li><p>Non-stretch: Try to avoid &#39;stretch&#39; or elastic jeans unless they are fitted just right. If you have larger thighs it can look like a <a href="http://images.sodahead.com/profiles/0/0/1/0/1/8/2/0/8/fat-guy-in-skinny-jeans-108238788178.jpeg">stuffed sausage</a> and appear really unflattering, especially if your calves are skinnier. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Joggers/Pants:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jack and Jones: make great joggers/cargo that are stretchy. Same with their jeans (beware though, slim cut is more like skinny) </p></li>
<li><p>Zanerobe: Make great joggers, typically size down as they will stretch out easily. </p></li>
<li><p>Publish: Make some great joggers but can rip fairly easily due to the cheap material. They are true to size and have a really really short leg so if you are a 34 leg, it will be fairly awkward. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tshirts</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure t-shirt sleeves are not very long as longer sleeves make your torso appear shorter, making you look heavier. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not wear anything that is short with long pants or high tops, will make your body appear severely disproportionate. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Designer:</strong></p>

<p>Ah yes ok finally. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Designer/streetwear companies that are common on this sub that fit TTS typically and you don&#39;t need to stress when ordering online: 
<em>Cav Empt, Stussy, Fred Perry, Alexander Wang, Supreme, Midnight Studios, HBA, Cheap Monday, Nudie, Jack and Jones, Bape, Dertbag.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Designer/streetwear companies that fit either slim, bizzare, or require a sizing up for sure. If you are already an XL, make sure you are a trim one like myself or else it will just be simply too small: 
<em>Y-3, Acne Studios (although, tshirts just fit a little shorter rather than slimmer), APC, Comme Des Garcons, Zara, Hugo Boss, Visvim.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sneakers</strong>: </p>

<p>Honestly you can pretty much wear whatever, I personally avoid hightops/bulky shoes as my foot size (13-14 US) can make them look like clown shoes. I typically stay with low tops. </p>

<p>Example shit-fit pic from December when I was 30lbs heavier: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Xh5jYHq.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/Xh5jYHq.jpg</a></p>

<h2>This guide is for the essentials, basically a list of a bunch versatile clothing you can use create your own unique look.</h2>

<p>This is just a list of the essential items of streetwear culture. I think this essentials guide will help all the lil bro&#39;s (and gals) trying to get into the game, see what&#39;s in style and how everything works together and start to develop their own style.</p>

<p>Streetwear is what you make it.</p>

<h3><strong>SHOES</strong></h3>

<p>Maybe its just because I started out as a sneaker head, but I believe shoes are a HUGE staple in the streetwear scene. Your kick game could make or break your fit, so step it up lil bro&#39;s. This list of shoes is for the average streetwear kid and I feel like every person should have atleast one or more of these shoes. I have listed these shoes because you could take almost any one of these shoes and they could go with almost any fit. Versatility is essential, specially when you can&#39;t afford a pair of sneakers for every fit.</p>

<h2><strong>Vans</strong></h2>

<p>Van&#39;s are one of the most iconic shoes that are readily available to almost everyone.</p>

<p>Sk8 Hi&#39;s
<a href="http://i4.minus.com/ibq3up9mV9zTe2.jpg">OG black</a> or <a href="http://www.nylonguysmag.com/nylonguys/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/L1060563.jpg">True white</a>
Probably one of the most popular streetwear shoes, you could never go wrong with a pair of sk8 hi&#39;s. Whether you&#39;re reminiscent of your old days on a skateboard or trying to be like yeezus, coolin it in your sk8 hi&#39;s will be in style for quite some time.</p>

<p>Also any type of <a href="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2qmjkkqZr1r0sj31o1_500.jpg">vans era</a>, IMO, are an essential. </p>

<h2><strong>Nike</strong></h2>

<p>obviously the most popular brand of shoe in the western world, if you don&#39;t have at least 1 pair of Nikes you&#39;re already falling behind in the game. It really doesn&#39;t matter what kind of Nikes you have as long as you got that big check mark on the side that lets all the bitches know you <em>just do it</em>.</p>

<p>Some classic nikes are:</p>

<p><a href="http://meelleyou.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/khris-johnson.jpg">Blazers</a> 
Just like the sk8 hi&#39;s, these shoes are able to transcend many different style. </p>

<p><a href="http://nitrolicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CLOT-x-NIKE-AM1-2.jpg">AM1</a> and <a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/fcd2be0ec7e04f061482ec8936640ad3/tumblr_mgh1i3E8Ll1rrhuwno1_500.jpg">AM90</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of people would argue that these aren&#39;t just quite essential, and I would agree. But I am adding it to this thread because I think they&#39;re growing in popularity and would love to see more of these shoes in the game. They&#39;re so versatile and have such a large variety of colors I wouldn&#39;t see why you wouldn&#39;t want to cop a pair of the AM1&#39;s or AM90&#39;s</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn10.lbstatic.nu/files/looks/medium/2013/06/14/3104041_denny1.jpg?1371220953">Roshes</a>
If I see another pair of roshes I might kill myself. But on a serious note these things are madd popular right now so I feel as though I had to throw em on the list.</p>

<p><a href="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/hoodstar911/JORDANS.jpg">Nike Air Jordan</a> 
<strong>THE MOST INFAMOUS BRAND OF SHOES YOU&#39;LL FIND</strong>
There are so many types, colors, silhouettes of J&#39;s you&#39;ll never get bored. Whether you want to look fly like <a href="http://sneakersmadame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/air-jordan-1-bred-rihanna.jpg">Rihana</a> and rock some bred AJ 1&#39;s or maybe something more modern and clean cut like the white cement 4&#39;s choo jackson is wearing in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnETsxe1RMM">swangers</a>. If you want to take the next step towards being a streetwear deity definitely go cop yourself a pair of J&#39;s.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/InsmvvvA6o0/hqdefault.jpg">Nike SB</a>
 Definitely check out some of the popular models like <a href="http://sneakersaddict.com/images/Hendrik-Schafer-Nike-SB-Stefan-Janoski-Digi-Floral.jpg">Janoskis</a> or <a href="http://cdn.sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/nike-sb-koston-x-heritage-sail-black-photo-blue.jpg">EK&#39;s</a>.</p>

<h2>Converse</h2>

<p><a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4103/4982617328_d51b09d20e_z.jpg">Chuck Taylors</a> have been around since the 1960&#39;s and they&#39;re still relevant. Go grab a pair. You really can&#39;t forget the <a href="http://cdn.solecollector.com/media/sneakers/images/robert-pattinson-converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-black-yellow.jpg">black</a> or <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mbCYbbS4fvg/UVrOAoGfXuI/AAAAAAAABG0/7KXXUbIPyLI/s1600/Dag+92.jpg">white</a> low tops.</p>

<h2><strong>Trainers</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.blessthisstuff.com/imagens/stuff/new-balance-574-revlite.jpg">New Balance 574</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.8and9.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solebox-saucony-lucanid-6-2.jpg">Saucony</a></p>

<p><a href="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hypebeast-wordpress/image/2013/08/a-closer-look-at-the-concepts-x-asics-gel-lyte-iii-three-lies-0.jpg">Asics</a></p>

<p>I compiled these 3 together, because I wouldn&#39;t consider having 1 of each essential, but definitely having 1 of the 3 would be wise. As my friend the RZA would say, Diversify your <strong>bonds</strong> <em>nigga</em>, or in this case, shoes. Everyone gets tired of seeing Nikes all the time, mix it up fool. </p>

<h2>Adidas</h2>

<p><a href="http://souplesselifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Adidas_StanSmith02.jpg">Stan Smiths</a> Smooth and simple.</p>

<h3><strong>SOCKS</strong></h3>

<p>Always overlooked. Socks <em>can</em> play a huge role. Whether they be lowcut because you want to flaunt them <a href="http://cdn3.thehundreds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/real-story-behind-jogger-pant-4.jpg">beautiful ankles</a> or you&#39;re wearing some sk8 hi&#39;s with some pinrolled jeans and want to have some interesting contrast in that small gap to let others know YOU PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL. <a href="https://warosu.org/data/fa/img/0075/64/1389126957841.jpg">Perfect example</a>. Remember you can always go to a Ross, Marshalls, or Old Navy and find some loud socks to update your fit if you don&#39;t have enough guap for these.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.extrabutterny.com/products/ice-cold-new-york-dotted-3m-reflective-half-calf-socks-blue">Reflective and Expensive</a></p>

<h3><strong>BOTTOMS</strong></h3>

<p>The most important part of bottoms that people over look is THEY SHOULD SUIT YOUR BODY FIGURE. If you wear a size XXL and buy super slim pants your ass finna look like a lamp, and no one loves lamps but <a href="http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/3792502/i+love+lamp">brick.</a> Pants always too long? Never fit right with your sneakers? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnrndUAUe9s">Pinrolling will change your life</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Joggers</strong></h2>

<p>Lets start off with <strong>joggers</strong></p>

<p>Anyhow <a href="http://i.nordstromimage.com/images/Store/blog/men/2014/4_28/nordstrom_mens_shop_daily_blog_publish_brand_legacy_jogger_pants_launch_7.jpg">Joggers</a> are basically the most comfortable pants you&#39;ll ever wear. Definitely great pants if you&#39;re trying to let your kick game shine. There are all types of joggers whether you want chino, sweatpants, or even denim. If you&#39;re looking for a pair, definitely check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/209373/blue_is_purples_intro_guide_to_joggers/">this guide.</a></p>

<h2><strong>Jeans</strong></h2>

<p>Probably the most popular jeans out there, <a href="http://us.levi.com/family/index.jsp?ab=Men_leftNav_Features_men%27soutfits&amp;categoryId=11510053&amp;cp=3146842.4305630">Levi&#39;s</a>
Levi&#39;s have every fit and every color you could want in a pair of jeans, look up on their website how all their fits work, pick one best tailored to your body shape, then go out and about like the majestic beast you are look sharp af.</p>

<h2>Chinos</h2>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t love a pair of chinos?</p>

<p><a href="http://superette.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/lfw30910mdsc_0536-687x1024-640x953.jpg">1</a></p>

Some really poppin brands right now are supreme, stussy, 10deep, thenorthface, a bathing ape, although they get a lot of hate and criticism on this sub, obey and diamond supply co are still relatively popular, HUF, billionaire boys club, and the hundreds. There are just a few of the more popular brands, I <strong>am not</strong> saying these are the only brands that are popular, or that you need everyone of these brands. These are just a few good brands to look into.</p>

<h2>Button Up/Flannel</h2>

<p><a href="http://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6641372/Farmall-IH-Mens-Red-Plaid-Hooded-Flannel-Jacket-P14204605.jpg">Layer up</a> and show the people of the world you know what you&#39;re doing, or button it up all the way and show them hoes how modern you are.

Just don&#39;t go <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2257209/Wealthy-Indian-Datta-Phuge-spends-14-000-shirt-GOLD-impress-ladies.html">overboard</a>.</p>

<p>Raw Denim:</p>

<p>“What Is Raw Denim?</p>

<p>Rather, when is denim classified as &quot;raw&quot;? The answer to this question is amazingly simple. It all has to do with washing. Raw Denim is any denim that is untreated or unwashed and is therefore left in an unadulterated form. The opposite of this is pre-washed, pre-distressed, or treated denim. Below is an example to illustrate the difference.”</p>

<p>Wearing raw denim can result in <a href="http://www.heddels.com/2015/12/fade-friday-samurai-jeans-710xx-29-months-2-washes-1-soak/">sickfades</a></p>

<h2>user submitted denim guides</h2>

<p>Levi fit guide courtesy of: <a href="/u/LurkVille">/u/LurkVille</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>508 Regular Taper: Slouchy on top, tapered through the leg. Colour choice is limited.</p>

<p>510 Skinny Fit: The skinniest pair Levi’s has. Sits below the waist and skinny from hip to ankle. Designed with a little stretch for extra mobility (2% elastane). Colour choice is rather wide.</p>

<p>511 Slim Fit: One of Levi’s trademarks, can almost suit any style you want. These jeans sit below the waist with a slim leg from hip to ankle. Very big variety of colours and some have a special Waterless Protection.</p>

<p>522 Slim Taper: Fit close through the thigh with a tapered leg from knee to the ankle. Has a decent amount of colours and also has Waterless Protection.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>More info on raw denim from <a href="/u/pegthaniel">/u/pegthaniel</a> and <a href="/u/frenchfrieskl">/u/frenchfrieskl</a></h2>

<p>Unbranded $: 1XX is slim, 2XX is tapered, 3XX is straight, 4XX is skinny. All low rise, small pockets.</p>

<p>Gustin $: cheap, long lead time because they manufacture after you order. Slim, Straight, and Skinny options. Huge variety.</p>

<p>Naked and Famous $$: Even more variety. Weird Guy is tapered mid-rise, Skinny Guy is slim low rise, Super Skinny Guy is skinnies. Rarer but existent fits include Regular Guy (straight) and Stacked Guy (super strong taper for stacking). Often on sale for $.</p>

<p>Nudie $$: Lots of fits and fabrics. Don&#39;t know as much about this one because I don&#39;t like their back pockets.
Japan Blue $$ (when ordered from Japan): Crazy good value.
Sugar Cane $$ (again, from Japan): Cool fabric made from 50% sugar cane fibers so they smell sweet for a couple washes. Generally slower fades. Vintage (as in, straighter leg) cuts with a &quot;2015&quot; option that is a more modern tapered slim.</p>

<p>APC $$$: Construction and fabric quality are relatively low but they have really good cuts for the skinny white kids all over this sub. Petite Standard is skinny, Petite New Standard is skinny legs with a bigger top block, New Standard is slim, New Cure is slim-straight with a wider top block and no selvedge detail, and the Rescue is a looser tapered fit. Can be found lightly used for $-$$.</p>

<p>Acne $$$: Basically the same deal as APC, but has a cool never-fading black. Not as common to find on sale or used for $.</p>

<p>3sixteen $$$ : Awesome fits (SL = slim-straight, ST = slim tapered, CT = wider top block and tapered, CS = mid/high rise and little taper), awesome fabrics: 100 is a classic blue/white (blue outside threads, white inside threads), 101 is an unsanforized 100, 120 is a high-constrast fading blue/black, 121 is an unsanforized 120, 130 is heavyweight blue/white, 140 is heavyweight blue/brown, 220 is black/black for a really deep color, 44 is khaki.</p>

<p>Rogue Territory $$$: Again great fabrics (Stealth = black/grey, Dark = blue/black) with cool seasonal stuff like waxed or blanket lined denim jackets, raindrop camo, etc. Fits are tapered (Stanton) or slim-straight (SK). Also makes trousers AKA chinos.</p>

<p>Samurai/The Flat Head/The Strike Gold/The Real McCoy $$$$: Crazy cool details and fabrics in what are often reproduction (AKA straighter) cuts. Basically for denim nerds.</p>

<p>Eternal/Oni/Kamikaze Attack/Momotaro/Pure Japan Blue $$$: I place these in a different category because it&#39;s not quite reproduction stuff, but they&#39;re still part of the new wave of denim. Oni has crazy hard tapers, are intensely slubby, and often fast fading. Eternal has awesome patches.</p>

<p>Studio D&#39;Artisan/Denime/Evisu/Full Count/Warehouse $$$$: the OGs of Japanese denim. Respect your elders. </p>

<p>Evisu and SDA are more crazy. The other 3 are generally super conservative and closely follow Levi&#39;s old fits.</p>

<p>Dior/SLP/Balmain $$$$$: Paying for special details (biker), distressing, and fit. Consider learning to tailor and distress across 10-20 pairs of Levis for the same price as these, because those skills will follow you for a lifetime.</p>

<p>saint laurent: slp is known for their denim, with the most popular being the skinny d02 cut. the denim used in these jeans is known to be a heavier and thicker japanese denim than other brands, and features the signature 15.5 cm hem. this results in different and easier stacking when wearing the jeans.</p>

<h2>Leather</h2>

<p>Leather comes in different qualities and with higher quality comes a higher price</p>

<h2>on the higher end of leather we have <a href="https://www.schottnyc.com/products/mens-leather-mc-jacket1.htm?catID=7">schott</a> <a href="http://alessandrini-newyork.com/collections/leather-jackets/products/copy-of-classic-leather-biker-jacket">alessandrini</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/zsaj4/leather_jackets_a_lengthy_buying_guide_v10/">here</a> is a lengthy guide on leather jackets</h2>

<h2>Layering</h2>

<p>A major key to putting your outfit together is layers.  Layering can either be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/94kkdBuf-Y/">executed well</a> or <a href="http://imgur.com/YK374Rd">not so great</a></p>

<p>A few pieces to consider when layering are:</p>

<p>Curved hem:</p>

<p><a href="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0251/8439/products/EMT013859LSCH-BLK_1.jpg?v=1446773907">here</a></p>

<p>Long Line:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=longline+tees&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXpvqNt47KAhUEox4KHWw7DQ4Q_AUICCgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979#imgrc=dkxRnzIgP4ErcM%3A">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB18VNmIXXXXXXSXVXXq6xXFXXXB/Plus-Size-longline-long-sleeve-t-shirt-extra-length-t-shirt-solid-tall-tee-men-tshirt.jpg">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.boohoo.com/content/ebiz/boohoo/invt/mzz96133/mzz96133_black_default_xl.jpg">here</a></p>

<p>When layering stick to this <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/452611831275390731/">guide</a></p>

<p>Seriously, layer your long stuff under your short stuff and your big stuff over your thin stuff, the point of the curved hem and longline tees are to hang lower than the rest of your tops and the top is hidden so the curv hangs out and acts as a sort of accent.</p>

<p>A few combinations for layering are:</p>

<p>Hoodie under coat/jacket</p>

<p>Flannel over Hoodie</p>

<p>long line tee/curved hem under a normal tee under a light jacket</p>

<p>Layering can also apply to <a href="http://sneakerbardetroit.com/undefeated-is-giving-away-11-pairs-of-the-yeezy-boost/">socks</a>  the picture here illustrates a pair of thin wool socks with the models pants tucked into them, when you combine thin fabrics it flows smoothly and is pleasing to the eye</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/">adidas</a> also a well known brand already, they helped make YZY SZN 1 and are known for their <a href="http://news.adidas.com/US/Latest-News/adidas-Unveils-Ultra-BOOST-with-Highest-Energy-Return-Yet/s/8c8dac9b-42e8-4be3-ba8c-d75aedb1cbdb">ultra boost technology</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vans.com/">vans</a> affordable shoes good for when you&#39;re starting out.  An <a href="/r/streetwear">/r/streetwear</a> favorite is the <a href="http://www.vans.com/shop/suede-canvas-sk8-hi-black-white">Sk8-Hi</a> Vans write up by <a href="/u/lurkville">/u/lurkville</a> Vans is a California skateboarding staple but lately their style extends to more than skateboarding, namely Streetwear, that’s why you are here.
Their 3 staple models are:
Authentics
Era’s
Old Skool’s + Sk8 Hi
The shoes that are most used in streetwear are the Old Skools and the Sk8 Hi&#39;s. They both are simple looking shoes that you can wear with almost everything and that look best beat.
Therehave also been a lot of collaborations with brands like Supreme, Opening Ceremony, Pendleton, Wolf Gang, Disney …
This winter Vans released a new type of sk8 hi, the MTE’s. The Sk8-Hi MTE revamps the legendary Vans high top with weatherized additions designed for the elements. Premium Scotchgard®-treated leather uppers, warm linings, and a heat retention layer between sock liner and outsole keep feet warm and dry while the newly-constructed vulcanized lug outsole takes advantage of 20 years of snow boot history for maximum traction. The Sk8-Hi MTE also features re-enforced toecaps to withstand repeated wear, signature waffle rubber outsoles, and padded collar and heel counters for support and flexibility.
Vans also has a couple of modernized shoes for example the ISO 1.5 and the Style 25. The Vans Style 25 is a mid-top shoe. The upper takes inspiration of a desert boot which gives it a formal look. The midsole which is Ultra Cush makes it look more like a lifestyle shoe. So you get a combination of two styles with a really comfortable feel.</p>

<p>Short guide to not getting scammed on the second hand market</p>

<p>Legit checks: Brands like supreme and bape are the most popular brands to be faked to avoid buying a fake you can submit pictures of the item to <a href="/r/supremeclothing">/r/supremeclothing</a> <a href="/r/bapeheads">/r/bapeheads</a> or <a href="/r/fashionreps">/r/fashionreps</a> <a href="/r/repsneakers">/r/repsneakers</a> and hopefully they can help you</p>

<p>Tagged pictures: A popular way people enjoy scamming is by using a picture that is not theirs and claiming it is theirs.  The best way to make sure the person has the item is a tagged picture which is a picture of the item with their name written out on paper next to it.  Sometimes people steal tagged pictures and make accounts with the same username, no matter the reputation or transactions someone has you should always reverse image search the picture, it only takes a few seconds and can save you a lot of trouble and money</p>

<p>Gifting/Invoicing: paypal has two different ways of buying/ selling; through gifting or through invoices.  An invoice is a description of the item and guarantees your protection if the item is not what you ordered or if the buyer flakes on you.  If you do happen to get scammed and you were invoiced you can open a dispute with paypal and you will get your money back within a month.</p>

<h2>When trading: find a middle man who has a good reputation, you both ship your items to them then the middle man will ship out the items to the respectable parties</h2>

<p>Words to live by and remember:</p>

<p>Talk shit post fit</p>

<p>Wear whatever you want, unless it’s weird and doesn’t fit the <a href="/r/streetwear">/r/streetwear</a> uniform</p>

<p>Have common sense when doing transactions and selling</p>

<p>Don’t take it too seriously, nobody actually really cares that much about what you’re wearing</p>

<hr/>

<p>Quote from <a href="/u/schwarza">/u/schwarza</a> to leave you with </p>

<p>&quot;Often in this sub, discussion is centered around the brand/designer rather than the actual fit/versatility of the clothing, by this I mean, someone may post an outfit saying ‘what goes well with Yeezy 350 boosts in X colorway’ or someone may post a fit that is completely incoherent yet has plenty of ‘popular’ brands such as Bape/Supreme showing.</p>

<p>The main piece of advice I’d give when picking out branded/graphic pieces is to make sure that you can picture a particular fit with the item you’re buying, In my opinion it’s best to try and avoid purchasing a designer/hyped piece solely because of the brand. The brand should come secondary to the practicality/applicability of the clothing in your own outfits. By this I mean, If you see an Off-White/palace/Supreme piece of clothing, Don’t go out and buy the cheapest shirt with the visible logo on it unless you already visualize an outfit with it. Streetwear is about having coherent outfits that can be complemented by branding, not about finding outfits to blend with loud graphics&quot;</p>
