<button onclick="toggles(568)">View full post</button><div id="568" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Animations are a bit weird to deal with. First and foremost, make sure in your operation system’s accessibility settings that you have enabled “Reduced Motion”. Below is a copy/paste set of instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li>On a Mac you go to &quot;System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display&quot; and check the box for &quot;Reduce motion&quot;.</li>
<li>On iOS go to &quot;Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility&quot; and turn on&quot;Reduce Motion&quot;.</li>
<li>On Win10 go to &quot;Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Display &gt; Simplify and personalise Windows&quot;. Set &quot;Show animation in Windows&quot; to off.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you enable “Reduced Motion”, this sets a flag that website’s can read that you don’t want a bunch of movement on the page. Developers can check for this flag and put in special CSS that can reduce or stop animations altogether. The reason I said animations are weird to deal with is because not all developers code for this flag, so this may not work for you. Another thing you could try, using the Stylebot extension, is setting a global rule to make animations/transitions take 0 seconds, effectively making everything happen instantly:</p>

<p>*::before, *::after, * {
    animation-duration: 0s;
    transition-duration: 0s;
}</p>

<p>The “*” selector means to apply these rules to every element on the page. If for some reason this doesn’t immediately work, try setting “!important” before the semicolon on each rule to force it to override the CSS that has already been set.</p>

<p>This doesn’t really affect JavaScript-based animations, and really the only way to deal with that would be to disable JavaScript, which could have unintended consequences to navigating a website.</p>

<p>As far as Ads, keep in mind that a lot of ads are still animated gif images, and the solutions above wouldn’t affect them. If you are seeing ads that are detrimental to your health, I’d highly suggest getting an ad blocker extension installed. Your health and well-being should never have to be compromised for a company to make money.</p>

<p>Edit: Added before and after pseudo element targeting to css example. Thanks <a href="/u/bruhred">u/bruhred</a> for pointing that out!</p>

<p>You can in fact change how a page looks on your end, but only for that specific time that it’s been loaded on your browser. Reloading the page would undo your changes.</p>

<p>Essentially what is happening when you visit a website is that HTML, CSS and JavaScript is sent to your browser on how it is supposed to look and operate. Your browser takes that code and builds the page for you to see. Because of how this works, you can use the element inspector to change practically anything on that page so it looks different for you, but it wouldn’t be permanent.</p>

<p>If you do want CSS changes to be permanent though, if you are using Chrome or another Chrome-like browser, you could install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en-US">Stylebot</a> extension, which will allow you to save those CSS changes to be automatically applied every time you visit that page.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(735)">View full post</button><div id="735" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s legit.</p>

<p>KMS is basically a server authorized by Microsoft to give keys and activate their products. Used for example by businesses to activate MS products on their computers. IIRC there have been changes to the terms on KMS so they&#39;re owners are pretty much allowed to do what they want with them.</p>

<p>This guy is super generous with his and made it public: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/msguides.com/microsoft-software-products/activate-office-365-proplus-free.html/amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/msguides.com/microsoft-software-products/activate-office-365-proplus-free.html/amp</a></p>

<p>You just have to be literate enough to follow the instructions to use the correct installer (cant use the trial installer, have to have had a full installation or follow his instructions to get the instructable installer from MS) and to set it to his KMS server and you have full Office 365 for free <em>(so long as his KMS doesn&#39;t expire of course)</em></p>
