<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago I released the first (and only) hate5six DVD to raise money for the relief effort in Haiti. I haven’t sold a copy in about 10 months. I have hundreds of these things left and they need to go. They are only $5 and all proceeds go to the charity. Guess people didn&#39;t know, or forgot, this thing existed.</p>

<p>There&#39;s about 4 hours worth of (pre-HD) footage featuring: 108, BLACK KITES, CONVERGE, DAMNATION AD, GIVE, HAVE HEART, IRON CHIC, KID DYNAMITE, MINDSET, PULLING TEETH, RUINER, SERAPHIM, SUICIDE FILE, THE FIRST STEP, THE RIVAL MOB, TOUCHE AMORE, TRIAL, UNBROKEN </p>

<p>When I travel or go to my local record stores, I like to go through the punk/hardcore/emo section and pick up a couple 7 inch records of bands I&#39;ve never heard of. I try to keep them in the early 90s to early 2000s range. A lot of them end up being pretty rare, and not available on streaming services like Spotify. So I&#39;ve started a YouTube channel and I&#39;m posting a new full record every Tuesday and Friday as long as I have new ones to post. I already have new videos scheduled to post all the way through May, and still have more to add. Hit subscribe and check em out!</p>

<h2>For Modern Life is War fans: I found these old handwritten notes that Jeff (the singer) wrote about their four albums. Interesting peek into the band's history.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(875)">View full post</button><div id="875" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: title should say *first four records. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going through old files on my external hard drive and I came across these handwritten notes. If I remember correctly, when the band broke up, they had these &quot;anthologies&quot; for sale at their final show in Marshalltown, which was basically all of their albums plus other goodies. As part of the package, these handwritten notes were included, in which Jeff gives some background details on each of their first four albums: the self-titled EP, My Love My Way, Witness, and Midnight in America. (I didn&#39;t make it out to their final show so I forgot how I got a hold of these...)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/oQupzrs.jpg">Here&#39;s the introduction</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/QAJvcPz.jpg">Self-titled</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AqCqC5T.jpg">My Love. My Way</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Zb2jiig.jpg">Witness</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TNTNVsG.jpg">Midnight in America</a></p>

<p>Anyway, hope you guys find this as interesting as I do. The notes about Witness stand out to me the most; it&#39;s my favorite MLIW album by far and yet it seems like the writing process for it was the most turbulent.</p>
