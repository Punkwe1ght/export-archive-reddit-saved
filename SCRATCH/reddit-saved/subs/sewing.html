<button onclick="toggles(670)">View full post</button><div id="670" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m prepared for the deluge of downvotes, but I want to express my peace. I am doubtful that *all* of the people posting photos of their &quot;first project&quot; are presenting an accurate view. Of course, some of them are actually an initial foray into sewing, but I have the suspicion that some people are hiding their true level of experience so that redditors will pile on the praise and they will get lots of upvotes. Remember *your* first project? Did it turn out perfectly? Mine, neither. Most of us learned lessons, but didn&#39;t necessarily get a wearable garment out of it.</p>

<p>There, I&#39;ve said (written) it. Bring on the animus.</p>
