<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Who can hear you scream from space? Well, everyone, apparently. <strong>Vektor</strong> screamed and the international metal press listened. Their Terminal Redux is the best album of 2016 according to a calculated List of Lists, made out of no less than 83 heavy end of the year lists I crunched down for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/metaltotheteeth/posts/1629762337319064">To The Teeth</a>.</p>

<p>Every list&#39;s number one got 10 points, the number two got 9, and so on. The now troubled Vektor easily plucked the number one slot of this list, with 165 points. Runner-up <strong>Khemmis</strong>&#39; Hunted got 136 points and the bronze medal was snatched by <strong>Blood Incantation</strong>&#39;s Starspawn with 111 points. But Vektor isn&#39;t completely undisputed. From all those lists, they got six number 1 positions on the 28 lists they were mentioned on. That’s not particularly many, considering the size of the sample. Khemmis got three number 1 positions. Blood Incantation has four silvers and five bronzes, but never got a gold medal on any list.</p>

<h1>Variations on banality</h1>

<p>Of course, these are just lists. Just people who have written down what they liked this year. Sometimes in a group, sometimes within a certain subgenre, and yes, sometimes with their readership, medium or relations with bands and labels in mind. That&#39;s allright. Music in general is not a competition and it’s had to draw any conclusions about the state of music after some calculations. But still. Does the list tell us anything? Maybe we lost the big gods, like most genres. We&#39;re fragmented, divided. Sure. But we also have a lot to choose from. Metal is super diverse. The menu in front of us maybe lacks some signature dishes, but there sure is something for everyone. It’s not only metal either. I did this kind of list for my day job on pop music, and the obvious number one, Bowie’s Blackstar, wasn’t on top of a waving flag on a shiny silver tower above the rest - not like Kendrick Lamar was last year anyway. Some records I thought would do quite well, like Borknagar, Fuath and Negura Bunget, weren’t mentioned in the first 400 I wrote down. Big names like Darkthrone, Ulcerate and Uada weren’t even among the first 100 albums mentioned - although all three made the top-50. But some popular bands didn’t even make the cut at all: Deströyer 666, Brujeria, Ultha, Grand Magus, Vader… They were mentioned, but only once. Then again, others did much better than I’d expect. Astronoid is on 11, Mithras on 12, Haken, Hammers of Misfortune and Ghoul are all quite high. Did you expect that? I don&#39;t think I did. I was just really surprised how varied people’s lists were in the end. Almost every list added another one or two, and often more new records to the list.</p>

<p>This year’s list included 83 numerical eoty-lists which added up to 558 records in total. It was a lot of work to crunch down, and I probably made some mistakes. You can also easily criticize my methods, but I included as much great general lists I could find and tried to have a good mainstream/credible/underground mix and I think the list reflects that. Beforehand I filtered out most non-metal releases, but I didn’t comb out all the hardcore and hardcore-derived records that will never be one of us. They were on a lot of metal-lists, anyway. I did delete every record that had just one mention. Even if it was a number one record on a list. This to prevent too much power in the hands of just one critic or magazine. Everybody I included still has had some punch to throw, tough. I mean, see this as a huuuuge salad. You add all ingredients. Olives, tomatoes, maybe you like feta in it, maybe some rucola? Some asshole has thrown in a couple of madame jeanette peppers. Just a couple, but everybody&#39;s going to taste them. The final list is now 230 records long. I’ve put everything that was available <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/3b81m0AbxGE8WKhiEyciK6">in this Spotify playlist</a></strong>.</p>

<h1>Hatework</h1>

<p>There will be records you hate that are too high in this list. Others are too low or miss all together. Don’t be mad, don&#39;t downvote. There’s nothing I can do about it. And we’re all metalheads, and if there’s something we do well, it’s discuss metal right? Don&#39;t let thousands of eyebrows be raised in silence. If you miss something and can’t believe it wasn’t scored high enough to make the top-50, just ask me and I’ll see if I can find where it ended on the longlist. It’s hard not to find something you like though. There’s thrash, heavy, epic, doom, grind, crust, black, death and powerviolence on the complete list. Blackgaze, industrial, nü, viking, unblack, drone, funeral, Speed, stoner, symphonic, sludge, pagan, post, pirate, power, prog and pornogrind. Last note: it&#39;s a pity I couldn&#39;t include Shreddit&#39;s top of 2016 list, and although I don&#39;t agree, I understand why <a href="/u/Kaptain_Carbon">/u/Kaptain_Carbon</a> wants to see the year end first. No worries though: I think this list can serve as a reminder of what came out this year as inspiration for your lists here on Shreddit.</p>
