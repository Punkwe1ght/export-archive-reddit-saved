<p><strong>What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Maximum budget would be 700</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>ASAP like this week if not today </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>He has a monitor and mouse and keyboard. I would suggest he get a better mouse and key board but hat can come later</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you&#39;re in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>We live In Utah around Salt lake city. Not sure what a micro center is. He would prefer to order online though</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I am not sure what brands he has</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>He will not be overclocking</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Nothing specific that we know of, we both are PC noobs</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Honestly just basic case would suffice. He does like Red though he said</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>We do need a copy of Windows Windows 10- may as well..</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>He just wants a cool gaming PC so we can play overwatch and Mobas together. Also It would be nice if it could handle new games coming out. I just built a PC with a help of my other friend who isn&#39;t available and it came out to about 650. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
