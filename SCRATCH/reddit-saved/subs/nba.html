<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys. Because I&#39;m a huge basketball nerd with too much time on my hands, I made <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a>, a basketball management simulation game. It&#39;s kind of like Football Manager, or like MyGM mode in 2k. The difference is, it&#39;s completely free (note: free does not mean &quot;freemium&quot;, it means totally fucking free) and you can play as much as you want right in your web browser. No accounts, no downloads, no bullshit. <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/">You can start playing right now.</a></p>

<p>We also have an active subreddit <a href="/r/BasketballGM">/r/BasketballGM</a>. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9him/best_of_rbasketballgm/">Here&#39;s a list of the best posts, including various user-made roster files.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Okay, with that out of the way, I&#39;m going to write more. You know, I love you guys. I first posted Basketball GM here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/">2 years ago</a> and that took me from having basically no users to having a small, loyal userbase. I made another post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2bc03d/i_made_a_free_basketball_management_sim_game_to/">last year</a> that brought even more users. Building a game that people actually play and enjoy is incredibly rewarding, and I don&#39;t want to give you some sob story, but working on Basketball GM is a great way for me to temporarily ignore some shitty things going on in my life. And I owe it all to <a href="/r/nba">/r/nba</a> and you guys.</p>

<p>So... what&#39;s new for this offseason?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2014/09/revamped-player-development-algorithm/">More realistic player development</a></p></li>
<li><p>20% faster game simulation</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re really unlucky, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/344nzg/star_eaten_by_wolves_get_outta_here_and_way_to/">one of your players might die</a></p></li>
<li><p>More statistical depth</p>

<ul>
<li>New stats +/- and blocks against</li>
<li>Export stats to CSV for extreme nerding</li>
<li>Tracking of statistical feats (triple doubles, 50 point games, etc) - it&#39;s strangely fun to look back at all the incredible games after you&#39;ve played a few decades.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>More game modes</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi Team Mode to control multiple teams at once, which people are using to play multiplayer leagues like <a href="/r/BasketballGMFantasy">/r/BasketballGMFantasy</a></li>
<li>You can auto-play multiple seasons to see what happens without any human intervention</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tons and tons of little things, often <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/3chi1y/just_a_simple_suggestion/csvrrxy?context=3">based directly on user feedback</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter/basketball-gm">Basketball GM is back on GitHub</a> and I&#39;ve gotten some awesome contributions from the community, in particular from <a href="/u/battaile">/u/battaile</a> and <a href="/u/briansd9">/u/briansd9</a></p></li>
<li><p>This doesn&#39;t really affect gameplay, but it&#39;s still really fucking cool: <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2015/03/one-million-seasons/">over 1 million seasons have been played</a>! To put that in context... if you wanted to play 1 million seasons and you started playing 24/7 right now, you probably wouldn&#39;t make it to 1 million before you died! Yeah, that&#39;s a nice positive way to end this list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re still reading, <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/">go play a few seasons</a> and then give me some feedback here!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m back again for my annual &quot;tell people about <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a> during the dead of the NBA offseason&quot; post! First of all, if you&#39;ve never played Basketball GM, <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/">give it a try</a>, I think you might like it. It&#39;s a video game where you get to be the general manager of a pro basketball team, kind of like Football Manager or franchise mode in 2k. You sign players, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try not to get fired.</p>

<p>Most importantly: it&#39;s free. Yes, that also means no microtransactions or any kind of nonsense like that. I&#39;m not evil, I promise!</p>

<p>We also have an active community over at <a href="/r/BasketballGM">/r/BasketballGM</a> with tons of great content. <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9him/best_of_rbasketballgm/">Here is some of the best.</a></p>

<p>For those of you who have played Basketball GM before, but maybe haven&#39;t played much lately, let me take this opportunity to tell you about all the cool improvements to the game I made since last year. Because a lot of things have happened.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/03/player-ratings-and-development-changes-are-live/">Huge huge huge changes to how player development works</a>, making stats and career arcs more realistic. More info <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/02/player-ratings-and-development-beta/">here</a> and <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2017/09/more-extreme-heights/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>An option to select a <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/06/difficulty-levels/">difficulty level</a> to make the game easier or harder.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/05/draft-day-trades/">Draft day trades</a>, which was a long requested feature.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/05/relatives-fathers-sons-and-brothers/">Players can have relatives</a>, so you will see sons and brothers of existing players appear.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2017/12/most-improved-player-award/">Most Improved Player award</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are now a bunch more <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2017/10/even-more-advanced-stats/">advanced stats</a> for both teams and players, most importantly win shares.</p></li>
<li><p>God Mode now has a lot more options, such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7giky9/new_feature_for_horrible_people/">death rate</a>. That enabled <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8pvsjq/oc_the_nba_if_over_100_players_died_in_tragic/">this fun post here</a> which led to a lot of people contributing fun new ways for players to die.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/04/performance-improvements-in-large-leagues/">Performance keeps getting better.</a> Simulating thousands of seasons is no problem at all.</p></li>
<li><p>A constant stream of minor improvements (such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8amnw6/customizable_stadium_capacities/">1</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8seu1d/better_schedule_generation_for_nonstandard_not_30/">2</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8wydjs/while_you_were_enjoying_your_sabbath_dumbmatter/">3</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7lm733/santa_came_early_this_year_draft_team_history/">4</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7fsh37/minor_new_feature_easily_filter_the_free_agent/">5</a>), mostly in response to user feedback. I am always listening for new ideas!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also since posting to <a href="/r/nba">/r/nba</a> is where I got my initial userbase from, and Basketball GM has had such a huge positive impact on my life, I am very grateful for this community. Thank you. You are more than just memes! Although I do enjoy the memes too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>VPN and buy league pass through India. All teams + all playoffs + no blackouts = $15 for the whole season.</p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s my experience signing up through India for those asking:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rntazlJ.jpg">Signing up with my VPN set to Los Angeles (National TV/Lakers/Clippers all blacked out, no mention of playoffs).</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kpGvdye.jpg">Signing up up with my VPN set to India (every team + every game + playoffs + no blackouts mentioned + NBA TV)</a>.  999 rupees for the season converts to about $15 USD.  </p>

<p>So here&#39;s my experience/how I&#39;ve done it.  You have to sign up with your VPN set to India, and then every time you sign in after that, you&#39;ll also need your VPN set to India.  Since NBA.com uses cookies, I recommend using a separate browser to only log into NBA.com unless you constantly want to clear cookies every time, so I use Chrome for regular browsing, Firefox for logging into NBA.com with VPN set to India.  Once you&#39;re into the section where you can choose which game you want to watch, you can switch your VPN off or to a more local area (for less lag).  There you can freely switch between games, and all the games stream great.  No commercials, you just watch in-arena entertainment every time.  Box scores seems to be a better format on the India version of NBA.com too (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/GVtkAFM.jpg">US box score</a> vs <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KNmHWqs.jpg">India top of page view</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yB0hgAh.jpg">India full page view</a>).</p>

<p>No problem paying with a credit card with my home address in the US.  No problem with stream quality.  I watch from my PC or use my Steam Link to watch on TV, but haven&#39;t been able to watch on my phone (even with a VPN on) or Roku (though I&#39;m sure I could if I routed the Roku through my VPN).</p>

<p>Best part is, you&#39;re actually giving the NBA your money.  It&#39;s not like you&#39;re paying some third party whose just pirating the streams or whose operating under questionable international law.  You&#39;re paying the NBA directly.  International pricing arbitrage for the win!</p>
