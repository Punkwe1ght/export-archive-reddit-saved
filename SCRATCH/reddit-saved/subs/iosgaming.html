<h2>I played and ranked all 50+ Netflix Games with no iAPs or Ads to pick 15 ACTUAL good ones (short reviews + links inside)</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(151)">View full post</button><div id="151" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Netflix has over 50 games now, some of which are great, while others are just “meh”.</p>

<p>So I figured I’d play and rank them all + review the 15 best ones. So that you can get a quick idea of whether or not they’re actually worth checking out :)</p>

<p>This is meant as the 16th entry in my &quot;best of&quot; series here on the sub, where I’ve previously covered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/119w501/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Dungeon Crawlers</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/10ro7lw/these_are_the_12_most_anticipated_upcoming_mobile/">Upcoming Games of 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/z8qxv5/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Idle Games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/yrdooj/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Reverse Bullet-Hell games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/xw7lbr/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Turn-Based Strategy Games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/xdz1sz/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Offline RPGs</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/wvmerz/after_covering_600_games_these_are_what_i/">Multiplayer PvP Games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/wkx7cb/after_covering_600_mobile_games_these_are_what_i/">Mobile Ports</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/vitdp2/after_covering_600_mobile_games_these_are_what_i/">Tower Defense Games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/umftez/these_are_the_10_most_highly_anticipated_upcoming/">Upcoming Shooters 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/u7xblb/after_covering_500_mobile_games_these_are_what_i/">Traditional Roguelikes</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/tm4go1/i_played_and_ranked_all_14_netflix_games_with_no/">Netflix Games</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/t46vq8/these_are_the_12_most_highly_anticipated_upcoming/">Upcoming Games of 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/sd4fv1/after_covering_500_mobile_games_these_are_what_i/">MMORPGs</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/qjttd2/after_covering_500_mobile_games_these_are_what_i/">Action RPGs</a>.</p>

<p>__________</p>

<h1>THE BEST GAMES:</h1>

<p><strong>1) TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge (Fighting/Beat’em’up) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>The first game is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, which is a fun campaign-based beat &#39;em-up fighting game with both single and co-op multiplayer.</p>

<p>This is just a really well-made game, and it was already a massive hit on Steam and consoles before Netflix brought it to mobile. And for good reason, I might add.</p>

<p>The retro art-style and animations are spot-on, the level design is awesome, and there are more than 12 different attacks and combo moves to remember.</p>

<p>It also has quick match-making for the co-op multiplayer parts, and with 4 players in total, things get really chaotic - in a good way. So if you like fighting games, this is just a must-try.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>2) Lucky Luna (Platform/Action) - Portrait</strong></p>

<p>Another really great one is Lucky Luna from the developers of Alto’s Adventure.</p>

<p>This is a fun platform action game where the twist is that we can’t jump. So instead, we simply swipe left and right to move and use our speed and high precision to survive the dangerous traps and difficult boss rooms.</p>

<p>We’re scored based on how fast we complete each level, how many pearls we collect, and our number of deaths - and if you wanna reach the top of the highscores, this gets really intense!</p>

<p>The touch controls are perfect in this one, and there are lots of secret areas to discover, which I really enjoyed. And once we’ve completed the main campaign, there’s even an endless mode for some extra replayability.</p>

<p>I think most of you are gonna love this one.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lucky-luna/id1609150630">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lucky-luna/id1609150630</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>3) Into The Breach (Strategy/Roguelike/Sci-fi) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>It’s not all just fast-paced action games, though - because the turn-based sci-fi strategy game Into The Breach, from the developers of Faster Than Light, is also on mobile now.</p>

<p>Our objective is to use our customizable troops to destroy the invading aliens before they eliminate our civilian cities. And the entire game essentially plays like a roguelike, where we attempt to get through a series of randomly generated campaigns without dying.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great fun, and there’s plenty of replayability.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/into-the-breach/id1616542180">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/into-the-breach/id1616542180</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>4) Spiritfarer (Management/Casual) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>Another super popular PC game brought to mobile is the relaxing management game Spiritfarer.</p>

<p>It’s a beautiful story-based adventure full of delightful characters with great humor, and it’s almost impossible not to get immersed in the game’s theme of bringing stranded spirits safely to their afterlife.</p>

<p>Apart from the main objectives, we can also just travel between islands, catch fish, upgrade our boat, and much more. And with over 30 hours of gameplay, this is an easy recommendation.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spiritfarer-netflix-edition/id1610577424">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spiritfarer-netflix-edition/id1610577424</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>5) Dust &amp; Neon (Twin-Stick/Shooter/Action) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>Next is the Western-themed roguelite twin-stick shooter Dust &amp; Neon - which, yet again, used to only be available on PC but is not out on mobile.</p>

<p>Controlling a cyborg gunslinger, our job is to select a mission, kill all the monsters, find the secret areas, collect ammo, and defeat the bosses. And then repeat that.</p>

<p>In-between, we then improve our offensive and defensive skills, and gradually upgrade our base to make the next playthrough a bit easier.</p>

<p>The touch controls work alright, but they’re definitely the game’s biggest downside. But its great art-style and fun gameplay still makes it a nice experience.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dust-neon/id1622720173">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dust-neon/id1622720173</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>6) Reigns Three Kingdoms (Strategy/Card) - Portrait</strong></p>

<p>Reigns: Three Kingdoms is the fifth game in the super popular series of decision-based strategy games.</p>

<p>Just like in the predecessors, we’re presented with a seemingly endless series of events that we swipe left or right to respond to in different ways. Each of these decisions impact one of four traits, and if any of them become too unbalanced, we lose the game.</p>

<p>But this time around, we also have to recruit units that we then use to fight in the game’s new combat system. And they even took this system and built in an entire game mode just focused on real-time multiplayer combat.</p>

<p>It’s new, it’s fresh, and if you liked the previous games, I think you’ll enjoy it.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reigns-three-kingdoms/id1636948693">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reigns-three-kingdoms/id1636948693</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>7) Twelve Minutes (Point’n’Click/Thriller) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>I’m not gonna spoil the story of this one, but what I will say is that the top-down point’and’click thriller Twelve Minutes really got me hooked.</p>

<p>It’s basically a complex time-loop game where we have to figure out how to convince our girlfriend that time is repeating itself and then try to escape the loop. Okay, that’s all I’ll say. But I enjoyed this one, and I think you might as well.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twelve-minutes/id1608097361">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twelve-minutes/id1608097361</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>8) Relic Hunters: Rebels (Twin-stick/Shooter) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>I actually liked the twin-stick looter-shooter RPG Relic Hunters: Rebels more than I thought I would.</p>

<p>Playing as one of several fun characters with unique traits, we attempt to get through every single level by defeating the enemies, grabbing as much loot as possible, and gradually upgrading the 6 stats for each of the many different weapons.</p>

<p>It also has a bit of retro feel to it, so if you’re into that, definitely take it for a spin.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/relic-hunters-rebels/id1605236950">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/relic-hunters-rebels/id1605236950</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>9) Skies of Chaos (Bullet Hell/Flying) - Portrait</strong></p>

<p>The Bullet Hell genre has always been a favorite of mine, so I immediately fell in love when I tried Skies of Chaos - both because of its polished art-style, and the challenging boss fights.</p>

<p>The game features over 50 levels that reward us with resources used to upgrade and heavily customize the different parts of our airplane, effectively making it easier to complete the next challenges.</p>

<p>In my notes from when I played these games, literally wrote “holy shit, this is good!”. And I stand by that. It’s difficult to explain, but playing this game just feels awesome, and it’s rare to find a game of this quality these days. So I can’t recommend it enough.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>10) POINPY (Arcade/Platformer) - Portrait</strong></p>

<p>POINPY is a new game from the developers of Downwell, which, ironically, is a game all about moving upward instead of downward.</p>

<p>It’s basically an arcade action game where we swipe, aim, and release to jump around a vertical level with the objective of collecting and feeding fruits to the huge monster chasing us. Oh, and we also have to avoid the many enemies trying to kill us.</p>

<p>The gameplay is great fun, there are several characters with unique traits to unlock, and if you like arcade platformers, there’s a high chance you’ll enjoy this one.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netflix-poinpy/id1615093407">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netflix-poinpy/id1615093407</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>11) Desta: The Memories Between (Dodgeball/Turn-based/Roguelike) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>The developers of Monument Valley also released their newest game, Desta, recently, and it’s essentially a turn-based dodgeball roguelike wrapped in an interesting story about dreams and regrets with great voice-acting.</p>

<p>But even if you don’t care about the story, the team-based dodgeball gameplay, where we have to work with our childhood friends to defeat dream-versions of people from our real life, is good fun.</p>

<p>It’s easily one of the most unique games I’m gonna mention today, and I enjoyed it. Although I do agree with some of the reviews that it could just have been a story-based game instead of a roguelike.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/desta-the-memories-between/id1599584290">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/desta-the-memories-between/id1599584290</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>12) Tomb Raider Reloaded (Archero-like) - Portrait</strong></p>

<p>A game that ISN’T actually exclusive to Netflix, though, is Tomb Raider Reloaded, which is basically an Archero clone with a few new twists to the gameplay and some really badass boss fights.</p>

<p>The free version of this game is full of ads and pay-to-win monetization, but the Netflix version has none of that - and it actually turns it into one of the better Archero alternatives.</p>

<p>There’s lots to do in the game, and although they kept the energy system, you can easily play for an hour at a time without running out. So if you liked Archero, it’s worth checking out.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>13) Into The Dead 2 (Shooter/Zombie) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>Another game that also still exists outside of Netflix as a pay-to-win game is Into The Dead 2, which is a zombie shooter where our character automatically runs forward while we move left, right, and shoot to deal with the zombies attacking us.</p>

<p>The gameplay is split into a neat story-based campaign, with lots of weapons and companion pets to unlock and upgrade using the gold we earn.</p>

<p>With all the ads and in-app purchases removed, the gameplay is great fun, and I think many of you will enjoy this as a more casual version of a traditional zombie FPS.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>14) Moonlighter (Simulator/Dungeon Crawler) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>Moonlighter is another great, and despite Netflix removing the previous stand-alone paid version of the game (which REALLY wasn’t nice!....), I’m including it here because the game itself is definitely enjoyable.</p>

<p>It’s essentially a fun mix of an action RPG and a shop simulator, which means we go on dungeon runs to gather goods and items that we then try to guess the appropriate price for and put up for sale in our shop. And then we repeat that while gradually growing stronger.</p>

<p>As someone who used to spend entire days on Runescape’s Grand Exchange, I got pretty hooked on this gameplay loop.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>15) Asphalt Xtreme (Racing) - Landscape</strong></p>

<p>You might know that this used to be a pay-to-win game, but with all of that garbage removed, the core gameplay really shines, and it’s actually one of my personal go-to racing games right now.</p>

<p>The art-style has held up surprisingly well and there is lots of content to explore, so it’s definitely worth a try if you haven’t played it yet.</p>

<p>App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-xtreme/id1590574622">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-xtreme/id1590574622</a></p>
