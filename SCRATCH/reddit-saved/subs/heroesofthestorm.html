<p>HotS is centered on 4 aspects. Map objectives, shared experience, hero talents, and teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>Shared Experience:</strong> Teams in HotS share the same pool of XP and level as a team. XP can be earned through minions deaths, slaying enemy players, and destroying structures. Last-hitting minions is not required. Simply being close enough will allow you to soak up the XP. If you apply a DoT or use a long-range ability that results in a minion death you will receive XP regardless of your range from the minion.</p>

<p><strong>Talents:</strong> Heroes gain access to talents that augment their skills or offer new abilities at level 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20. When you first unlock a Heroe through the free2play rotation or the shop they start at level 1, this level is independent of the level achieved while playing a match. <em>For full details on Talents and in vs out of game levels read the HotS Level System information at the end of this post.</em></p>

<p><strong>Map Objectives:</strong> There are 7 maps available to play at the time of this post (and 1 in development). The map is chosen randomly when a game is started (unless you play the Custom Game Mode). Blackheart’s Bay, Cursed Hollow, Dragon Shrine, Garden of Terror, Haunted Mines, Sky Temple, and Tomb of the Spider Queen. Each map has a unique objective. The overall goal of each map is to destroy enemy structures and finally their core. The maps have added objectives that aid in the overall goal. It is important to remember that in HotS neutral camps, called Mercenaries, will fight for you after you defeat them.</p>

<p><strong>Blackheart’s Bay:</strong> The unique objective of this map is to gather coins and turn them in to have the ghost ship bombard the enemy structures. Coins can be gained from chests that spawn (there will be an audio announcement when they appear as well as a mini-map icon), mercenary camps, and neutral mob camps (noted by a purple flag on the mini-map). The first time coins spawn on the map it will take 10 coins to activate the ghost ship. Subsequent turn ins requires 2 additional coins each time (10, 12, 14,…)</p>

<p>Players can be interrupted while attempting to turn in coins, and if a player dies while carrying coins they will drop allowing friendly or enemy players to retrieve them (by walking over them). This is the only map that requires players to turn in the items they gather. On the other maps once you collect an objective item it will not be lost on death.

<p><strong>Curse Hollow:</strong> The goal of this map is to disable enemy structures and weakening enemy minions. The map will spawn “tributes”. A team needs capture 3 tributes to curse the enemy team. You do this by clicking on a tribute and channeling it item to receive it. Cursed teams will lose functionality of their turrets and their minions will be reduced to 1hp. It is important to remember that when the announcer indicates a tribute is spawning you have a short window to travel to the location and ready for a team fight. There is not enough notice to recall to base to heal before the tribute will spawn.

<p><strong>Dragon Shrine:</strong> This map has two shrines. One located above the center of top lane and the other located below the center of bottom lane. Standing in the indicated area around the shrine allows a team to capture the shrine. When a team successfully controls both shrines one member of that team can use the Dragon Shire located in the center of middle lane. The Dragon has two abilities. The first will allow you to breathe fire leaving behind a DoT AoE that burns enemies that stand in it. The second ability allows you to punt an enemy player away from you. The primary purpose of the Dragon is to damage enemy structures and push lanes. Your team should back you up when you control the Dragon to allow the controller to focus on punting enemies away and damaging structures.

<p><strong>Garden of Terror:</strong> When night falls on this map you will want to group up with your team and head to the Terrors. These neutral minions only spawn at night and drop flower bulbs. Collecting 100 bulbs will allow you to grow a Terror. Once you have grown a Terror you must go back to base and briefly channel the creature to take control of it. It is important to note that a grown Terror will not stay in your base indefinitely. After one minute the Terror will wilt and die so make sure someone is recalling to base to control it. Terrors have three abilities. The first places a plant that will cause AoE damage and disable enemy structures. The second will polymorph enemy players in to small plants that can only run away. The third ability will increase your movement speed for 3 seconds.

<p><strong>Haunted Mines:</strong> This two lane map has a second tier to it. When the mines open there will be icons that indicate where players enter the mines. Get your team together and enter the mines to kill neutral minions and gather skulls. There are 100 skulls total and when all 100 are collected each team will spawn a Golem. The power of your Golem is dependent on how many skulls you collect. If you manage to collect more than the enemy team your Golem will be more difficult to kill. Remember there are only 100 skulls and you’ll be competing against other the enemy to gather them.

<p><strong>Sky Temple:</strong> This map consists of three lanes. Each lane has a temple. When temples become active they can be claimed by a team after the team defeats the temple guardian(s). Once a team controls a temple it will continuously damage enemy structures in that lane for a period of time.

<p><strong>Tomb of the Spider Queen</strong> This map adds additional lane minions. These spider minions drop gems that can be turned in at two different locations. Once a team has turned in enough gems a strong spider minion will spawn in each lane and push the lanes hard. Gems are unique to each team. You may only pickup gems that are meant for your team. If you die holding gems your teammates can pick them up before they disappear.

<p><strong>Map Objective Timers</strong> This post has information on when the various map objectives spawn. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/2l5vc0/mapobjective_timers/">http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/2l5vc0/mapobjective_timers/</a></p>

<p><strong>What HotS does not include:</strong> HotS has opted to forgo some mechanics seen in other MOBAs. The most noticeable things not included in HotS are gold (currency), itemization, individual XP, and snowballing (carrying). </p>

<p><strong>Gold (currency):</strong> Each map has a unique currency to fuel the objectives of each map. These currencies were discussed previously. The only other currency is XP that is shared by team members. Gaining a level advantage can make or break team fights. </p>

<p><strong>Itemization:</strong> In HotS characters are customized through talents acquired at levels 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20. This design choice simplifies character balancing and removes multi-tier punishments found in other games.</p>

<p><strong>Snowballing:</strong> Blizzard chose to focus on encouraging team fights. Good play calls, communication, and teamwork are the best ways to shine in HotS. Without the ability to solo-carry a team players are rewarded for working together and abandoning the traditional solo-que mentality. </p>

<p><strong>Multi-tier Punishment:</strong> In other MOBAs teams can fall behind in several ways. Map objectives, currency, items, level, snowballing, vision, and more. Streamlining how many ways a team can be dominated means that even when you are ahead you must maintain good game play. HotS offers multiple chances for teams to continue maintaining their earned advantage, but over confidence can lead to a great power shift between teams. Players can find a losing game turn around with a few good pushes or well-timed objective skirmishes. </p>

<p><strong>What HotS accentuates:</strong> Players often wonder what sets HotS apart from other MOBAs. The design choices of Blizzard have led to a game that encourages teamwork, coordination, timing, and persistence. With opportunity to recover from poor fights and improve over the course of individual games players can turn bad games into victories. The talent system allows players to customize their Hero to aid their team or counter enemy players. Map designs offers variety of game play and shifting meta. </p>

<p><strong>Elimination of slow starts:</strong> Many MOBAs take time to get going. HotS eliminates much of the &#39;early phase&#39; seen in other games. You start off 3 basic skills. Objectives activate early, most within 90 seconds of the match starting. This leads to team fights beginning early. While heroes do gain significant power over the course of a match the game feels like it starts in a mid-game phase since heroes have more skills to use and level 1 skirmishes are common.</p>

<p><strong>HP/Mana:</strong> HotS has lane fountains. Players can use these fountains to gain a &quot;heal-over-time&quot; effect and gain HP/Mana back over a period of time. Fountains have a cooldown that will display after utilizing them. If your character is low hp/mana and a map objective is about to appear it may be quicker to Hearth (recall/B) to the main fountain. This will give you a large instant heal and half of your missing mana as soon as you recall. </p>

<p><strong>Filling Roles</strong> In Hero select there is the option for Auto Select; this is not a random pick. The game will consider what your matched teammates are playing and select a Hero that best fits the needs of the team.</p>

<p><strong>Expected changes:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>MMR (Matchmaking Rating):</strong> Heroes MMR is lackluster, but steady improvements have been made. As the pool of players expands MMR should become more accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Talents:</strong> Blizzard is striving to provide a balanced experience for players. Talents are meant to offer unique upgrades that are meaningful and fun. As the game evolves players can expect to see changes to existing talents or the introduction of new talents. </p>

<p><strong>Reconnect System:</strong> Currently the reconnect system is subpar. Blizzard is aware of the issues with reconnecting and the long time it takes to rejoin a game after a client crash or prolonged disconnect. Blizzard has stated they are working on a new reconnect system, but no ETA has been announced. </p>

<p><strong>Leaver Queue:</strong> Closed Beta has seen the addition of the Leaver Queue. Players that frequently quit games will be placed in a separate queue with other players that frequently leave games. Players can earn their way out of this queue by playing games until they are finished. The latest information on this system is available here: <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/17906504/heroes-closed-beta-patch-notes-february-10-2015-2-10-2015">http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/17906504/heroes-closed-beta-patch-notes-february-10-2015-2-10-2015</a></p>

<p><strong>Quick / Smart Cast:</strong> Improvements to this ability casting system can be expected. To enable Quick/Smart cast go to Options -&gt; Controls -&gt; Targeting -&gt; Quick Cast</p>

<p><strong>Future Heroes:</strong> The last hero introduced was Sylvanas. THis completed the release of all heroes mentioned at Blizzcon &#39;14, but we should expect to continue seeing additional heroes.</p>

<p><strong>HotS Level System:</strong> Players level their account and Hero levels in and out of game.</p>

<p><strong>Account level:</strong> This is akin to the League of Legends Summoner level. Unlike LoL, in HotS your account level grants rewards. Gold for buying access to heroes, additional F2P heroes, and access to daily quests (which grant bonus gold for purchasing heroes). Closed Beta has introduced Hero League (Draft Mode) at level 30 and Team League (Ranked-Draft Mode) at level 40. The max account level is 40. More information can be found here: <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/14845424/incoming-progression-system-and-reward-changes-7-18-2014">http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/14845424/incoming-progression-system-and-reward-changes-7-18-2014</a></p>

<p><strong>Hero Level (out of game):</strong> Heroes gain XP based on the XP earned in-game. All heroes start at level 1 and can be raised to level 10. Level milestones provide access to different things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 1: Starting point</li>
<li>Level 2: Heroic Ability (can be used in game)</li>
<li>Level 3: Expert Talents (can be used in game)</li>
<li>Level 4: Advanced Talents (can be used in game)</li>
<li>Level 5: 500 gold (used to unlock Heroes, mounts, or master skins)</li>
<li>Level 6: Hero Portrait &amp; Mount Variation (recolor) if hero uses a mount. </li>
<li>Level 7: Skin Variation (recolor)</li>
<li>Level 8: Skin Variation (recolor)</li>
<li>Level 9: Master Portrait &amp; Mount Variation (recolor) if hero uses a mount.</li>
<li>Level 10: Ability to purchase the heroes Master skin for 10k gold.
<em>Bonus out-of-game hero XP is awarded when playing with friends</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hero Level (in game):</strong> In-game teams start at level 1 and level together through a shared XP pool. If a team has a level disadvantage they receive an &#39;underdog&#39; bonus that scales the amount of XP they gain per hero takedown (kill). This underdog bonus increases the larger the gap is between team levels. Inversely, the higher level team will receive less xp per takedown. </p>

<p><strong>General Hero Tips</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abathur</strong> <em>A special note about an often misunderstood hero.</em> This hero has a very unique mode of game play. Even if your Abathur appears to be AFK they are likely there doing what they are supposed to be doing. Abathur has a <em>nearly</em> map-wide presence. He is pretty defenseless and you play him by laying traps around the map, granting shields, or hitching rides on other heroes, minions, or structures.</p>

<p><strong>Murky:</strong> This hero is the squishiest one. As few as two hit early game will kill Murky. Luckily Murky has a extra ability <em>Spawn Egg</em> (default keybind D). Placing an egg allows Murky to respawn 5 seconds after any death so long as the egg remains unbroken. Deaths while an egg is active do not count as real deaths. Murky is a very difficult character to play; players should focus on Coop-AI games until they understand the finer mechanics of this hero.</p>

<h2>The Basics: Play more, earn gold, and try to get better</h2>

<div id="31fs01" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here are my observations about how I win or lose games.  This is not <a href="/r/CompetitiveHotS">/r/CompetitiveHotS</a> Hero-League level advice.  This is the basics for quickmatch as you are trying to earn gold, buy more heroes, and get better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Up until level 10 at least, soaking lane EXP is important</li>
<li>After level 10, “not-wandering-off-alone” is important.  It’s actually always important – don’t wander off alone!</li>
<li>If one of your allies is wandering off alone, try not engage in a fight.  I guarantee the missing enemies will appear to turn it into a 4v5.  People will blame your teammate who was off by himself.  It is not his sole fault. It is your fault for fighting at a potential disadvantage.   (Yes, it would have been better if he had been grouped instead of elsewhere.  But it would have been a LOT better if you had disengaged instead of fighting - knowing he was absent.)</li>
<li>Late game, going for a less important objective as 5 is far more important than going for a better objective alone or otherwise not grouping.  Ping and make suggestions, but stay with your team.</li>
<li>Nothing is ever worth dying for except saving your core itself, or sacrificing yourself to save a more useful teammate from dying.  Play safe, but also don’t be afraid of taking <em>some</em> risks.</li>
<li>A useful piece of advice is to think of small skirmishes in terms of trading.  Did you or your opponent lose more health?  Did you get in free damage?  If you came out on top, you have &quot;traded effectively&quot;.  This is particularly important when playing Assassins or DPS heros - often getting in some less-risky damage is far more important than chasing or securing a kill.</li>
<li>If you survive after losing a team fight, you generally want to play clean-up until your allies respawn.  Clear the active mercs your enemies aren’t supporting, and push the creep waves away from your buildings.  Don’t take a merc camp if you are in defense mode.</li>
<li>In general, players under-prioritize using their heroes to manually push towers and keeps, and over-prioritize map objectives.  (I’ve won more games by pushing down a few towers early, which makes small pushes with mercs more dangerous for the enemy later.  They are forced to defend, and therefor you can more easily secure the next map objective later.  All because of a tower ten minutes earlier.)</li>
<li>Don’t take a merc camp without a specific reason, or because you happen to be next to it.  Especially don’t go deep into enemy territory to steal a merc camp.  Mercs are bad at defense, better on offense, but pretty easy for a hero to obliterate.  (If a map objective will spawn in a minute, now is an excellent time to clear a merc camp.  The mercs will push that lane while you and your team fight over the objective.   Otherwise, you should be pushing with the camp after you take it.  Pay attention - If you took a camp and the enemy simply clears it up like a creep wave without losing any map control, you took a camp at a bad time.  Don’t do that anymore.)</li>
<li>While pushing, do regular “should we retreat?” checks.  While I heavily advise pushing buildings over not-pushing-buildings, don’t go ham.  Don’t go too hard or too deep - this isn’t your prom night.  I use this analogy because going too deep is like getting caught with your pants down.  Think about the comparison.  In either scenario, you&#39;re about to get beaten up.</li>
<li>If you get scolded or yelled at for something, take this as a sign to retreat and group up.  Thinking back over my games, this would never have been a terrible mistake to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>What map you are on, what hero you are playing, team composition, and talent choice are far less important than the above points until you reach high-level play.  The primary objective is to destroy the enemy’s core.  The way to accomplish this is by destroying buildings somehow.  Map control, lane control, jungle and map objective control are secondary – they are only useful in how they allow you to eventually push to the enemies core.  Keeps are more important to defend or destroy than other map objectives – usually.</p>

<p>Plan ahead.  How will [X] affect the game 3 minutes from now after the next team fight is over.  What if you won that fight?  What if you lost that fight?  Will you be glad you did [X]?</p>
