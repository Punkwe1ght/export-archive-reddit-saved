<h2>[The Keys of Hel] The Iron Hands created cyber-zombie Space Marines</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(276)">View full post</button><div id="276" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context: Ferrus Manus has something called the &quot;Keys of Hel&quot; a series of technological discoveries he made during the Great Crusade that he forbade anyone from seeking out. After his death however some of the Iron Hands begin rummaging through his stuff and begin utilising the technology in their effort to hurt the traitors at any cost.</p>

<p>One of those discoveries is how to bring Space Marines back to life. I&#39;m posting this because it&#39;s something I haven&#39;t seen come up but is very Grimdark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The connections snap into place down my spine. Pain flashes along nerves and cables. My limbs become my own, dead flesh and machine answering with icy snarls.</p>

<p>I know what I am.</p>

<p>I open my eyes. Light pours into my world. Projected data bathes the chamber before me. Vapour rises from ice-clogged machines. I feel the snaking sensation as the flesh and machine fuse to my mind. </p>

<p>I step forwards. Ice falls from me in brittle scales. Pistons extend and snap my limbs into place. Energy crackles along conduits and I hear iron fingers flex. The pain is everything. Every sensation is a colour of agony. </p>

<p>I am a son without a father. I am a warrior risen from the edge of the grave of all he knew, and all that created him. I am the dead in a war of fools. </p>

<p>What are the Keys of Hel? </p>

<p>I am the answer. </p>

<p>I am a life stolen from the dark, and lived in oblivion. </p>

<p>I walk from my tomb, and behind me my brothers wake from their own sleep and follow me to war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Fire,’ I call, and the machines in my throat catch the word and carry it to my brothers. </p>

<p>They move like sleepers still half in a dream. We fire our weapons. Beams and shells rip the shell of the pod from us, and we are loose from the wreckage, diving towards the fort. We strike the hull. The impact shudders through me as my armour mag-clamps to the fort’s skin. Bones crack in the remains of my flesh I rise, pistons straightening, and I feel my weapons arm with a tingle of shifting agony. </p>

<p>A hatch blows outwards from the outside of the starfort. Five Death Guard roar into the vacuum in their void-harnesses. I fire and my brothers follow. </p>

<p>They are like me. They died on battlefields from Isstvan to Greydoc and have slept in cold dreams at my side. Most still dream, the echoes of life just tatters. They follow, and they know the pain of this un-life, but they are spared the thoughts that remain to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the Keys of Hel? </p>

<p>They were the seal placed by our father upon all the principles and knowledge that should never be applied. Few outside the Legion knew of the ban placed by Ferrus Manus on the Sarcosan Formulae, the Progression of the Seventh Gate, and the Ophidian Scale. Even amongst his sons few knew more than the name and, of those who did know, most grasped only shadows of dark possibility. </p>

<p>Cyber-resurrection, ghola, death and life bound by field, woven by metal and sung by axioms of the unknown. Created by man in the Dark Age of Technology, or by alien hands under cruel suns, their origin does not matter. They are the evolution that our father placed beyond our reach, the lock upon a gate to a denied realm. </p>

<p>I have walked through those gates, and now I step between stolen moments amongst the living. </p>

<p>I walk with fire, pain and hatred for all that has brought me here, and for all that has been lost. </p>

<p>And as I persist I think of my gene-father. Of the warrior who died, who fell and who allowed himself to be weaker than the universe. </p>

<p>And I know now – with every pulse of false life – that he was right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the Keys of Hel? </p>

<p>They are a voice growing fainter as the past walks away from us. </p>

<p>A key is a beginning, but once the door is open those beginnings are forgotten. </p>

<p>We walk through and leave what brought us there behind. We become the present. We become the inescapable now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Soter is another Iron Hand who opposes our narrator. And after he dies he too is resurrected]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soter wakes. </p>

<p>I am waiting for him when he does. He looks up at me. He no longer has a true face. Lenses and tangles of wire sit at the front of a skull of chrome. I watch the lenses twitch, watch the hand rise and the digits flex. </p>

<p>‘Welcome, brother,’ I say. </p>

<p>‘It...’ he begins, and then stops as though the buzz and click of his voice has surprised him. ‘It is... pain.’ </p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I say. ‘It is.’ </p>

<p>He rises, each limb moving one at a time until he is standing. ‘Will this end?’ he asks and his eyes are not looking at me but at the exposed flesh of his right hand, waiting for its skin of armour. </p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I reply. ‘When we wake no more.’ He looks for a moment longer at his still fingers, and then nods. </p>

<p>What are the Keys of Hel? </p>

<p>They are the reward for our weakness. They are the cruelty of iron. They are all we have left.</p>

<h2>[The Siege of Terra: Warhawk] The state of the Sons of Horus Commanders by the late Siege</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Woodstovia </span><span class = "numcomments">86 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/yqi9yo/the_siege_of_terra_warhawk_the_state_of_the_sons/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(379)">View full post</button><div id="379" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the Loyalists shattered and the Traitors on a clear path to victory the Sons of Horus begin realising that they&#39;ll have to hold whatever new Imperium they can forge together, and that comes with the realisation that by late in the Siege they aren&#39;t particularly united, and after the horrific losses taken to senior commanders the new leadership really isn&#39;t up to holding things together.</p>

<p>We also see from the loyalist POV that they don&#39;t even know who all these new Captains are...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Damocles Rhino revved out of the shadows, heading straight for Archeta&#39;s location. At the last minute, the command transport shuddered to a halt, the hatch swung open, and a single warrior emerged. He crunched down to the rubble and strode over to Archeta, clenching his fist and extending it in the Legion salute. &#39;Captain!&#39; he shouted. &#39;Here already, eh?&#39; </p>

<p>Archeta watched him approach. The warrior was kitted out much as he was - fine artificer-crafted battleplate, long fur-lined cloak, the Eye of Horus on his breastplate. They were equals, the two of them, as far as rank went, but Azelas Baraxa was captain of the Second Company, just one step closer to the master of the Legion. In another time, given the prodigious tally of throats they had cut for the Warmaster, both of them might have expected to have played a part in the Mournival, but in the aftermath of the disaster at the Saturnine Gate there had been little enthusiasm to revive that old convention. </p>

<p>What purpose would it have served, now? The Sons of Horus were the creatures of a living god, the warrior-slaves of an immortal deity. You did not advise a god, and you did not seek to give counsel to an immortal. </p>

<p>They had all become just soldiers again, the tools required for the task at hand, with the last of their Crusade-era pretensions swept away. </p>

<p>&#39;Aye, we&#39;re making good time,&#39; Archeta said passionlessly. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t like Baraxa. The Second Company captain was a visionless soul, wedded to how things had been before the great break with Terra. Like so many of the senior Sons of Horus, Baraxa looked on the gifts of the new dispensation with suspicion, clinging to the way things had been on Cthonia when they had all of them claimed not to believe in such things as gods. To maintain that view now was a failure of vision, a conservatism that did them no favours. When Torgaddon had been slain, the position should have gone to someone with similar gifts, a creature of the gods they now fought for, not another Ezekyle-clone, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the inevitable. </p>

<p>Baraxa came to stand beside him. &#39;They&#39;re broken, brother,&#39; he said. &#39;The Sanctum is just lying there. Ready to take. And I find I can hardly believe it.&#39; </p>

<p>The captain&#39;s voice rang with enthusiasm. Despite his distaste for the man, Archeta knew what he meant. This was the heart of it, the soul of the old empire. Most of his troops had never set eyes on Terra before, let alone walked down the streets of its ancient capital. The galaxy was full of wonders, millions of them, but nothing truly compared to this place, even in its ruin. At times you would catch yourself, sometimes even in the midst of combat, and remember where you were. You would glance up at the vast buildings around you, the urban profile that was so familiar from a thousand propaganda vid-reels, the carved insignias of the Crusade-era triumphs, the mighty edifices raised to fuel the momentum of that incredible, unrepeatable feat, and wonder how things had ever come this far. </p>

<p>&#39;It isn&#39;t over yet,&#39; Archeta said, not willing to get swept up into euphoria. &#39;We&#39;re being drawn further in - they still have three primarchs in there, somewhere.&#39; </p>

<p>Baraxa laughed. &#39;So cautious.&#39; He pushed his cloak back, flexed the fingers of his sword-hand gauntlet, gazed down the long avenue towards the mountainous building-dusters ahead. &#39;Bastion Ledge has been breached - you knew that? Three fronts, all converging. They can&#39;t handle that.&#39; He drew in a long breath, as if the air was something that might invigorate him rather than tear at his helm&#39;s overworked fox-filters. &#39;Thousands are coming through Mercury Breach alone, every hour now. It&#39;s a flood.. The Red Angel is inside, doing what he does best. This is overwhelming. We just need to get there first, now - break the last gate before the World Eaters render it all down to blood-slurry.&#39; </p>

<p>That was indeed the objective. The fragile unity between legions and factions had already broken. What little cohesion remained was contingent on the target before them all - the hated Emperor, the Deceiver and the Cheater of Birthright. Once He was slaughtered, it would all dissolve again. </p>

<p>The XVI Legion, greatest of Legions, the ones who had propelled and sustained this thing from the very start, would have to keep things from collapsing, and to do that they had to be in control of the centre, secure within the very same bunkers that they were now trying to prise apart. </p>

<p>&#39;Then he&#39;ll need to be back,&#39; Archeta said. </p>

<p>&#39;He already is.&#39; </p>

<p>That was a surprise. &#39;Abaddon? He&#39;s recovered?&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;He was fighting the Apothecaries, they told me, making their lives hell until they did enough to get him back to the front. He&#39;s landed at the Eternity Wall, heading for Mercury right now.&#39; Baraxa clapped Archeta on the upper arm. &#39;It&#39;s all we need to finish this. Our leader.&#39; </p>

<p>Archeta bristled. &#39;Our leader is on the Vengeful Spirit! </p>

<p>&#39;Of course. Of course! But then, down here—&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;What does that matter? Ezekyle&#39;s just a mortal. Just like us. You should watch where your words take you, Azelas - the Warmaster sees all and hears all.&#39; </p>

<p>Baraxa looked at him for a moment, taken aback. &#39;And is beloved by all,&#39; he murmured. </p>

<p>&#39;What?&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;Hells, brother, what&#39;s chewing at your guts? You should be pleased.&#39; </p>

<p>Yes, what was ailing him? Why was he not exultant, relishing the last push into the heart of hypocrisy? He had never withheld his blade hand before, never regretted a kill. The closer he got, though, the more ill humoured he became. </p>

<p>Horus was not with them. Maybe that was it. Archeta had witnessed the primarch fight, once, a long time ago now, and it was hard to imagine anything alive being able to stand up to that If Horus trod this ground, here, now, the whole thing would be over in hours. </p>

<p>Oh, Archeta knew all the cant that the sorcerers spouted about the great ward-shield, how it kept out those with the greatest gifts, but that barrier was in tatters now. If Angron could somehow rampage his way inside it, then surely the Warmaster could. As long as Horus remained absent, the fissures in his Legion would grow steadily wider. </p>

<p>You would have power brokers like Baraxa whose heads had been turned by the dynamic First Captain. Sycar, the new Master of the Justaerin, was said to be Abaddon&#39;s creature too. Maybe Ikari, the much-disliked captain of the Fourth Company, was also. What would they all do, if Horus never emerged at all? Would they start, steadily, to think about where their loyalties truly lay? Horus still commanded the allegiance of the Legion, that was true. Some had even begun to talk of him, as Archeta did, as a member of the true Pantheon, something elevated far beyond the merely human and worthy of a more strenuous kind of adulation. Beruddin, captain of the Fifth, was of a similar mind. Malabreux, the new leader of the Catulan Reavers, was fervent in the faith. But they were all so new, all so callow. </p>

<p>The entire leadership layer of the Legion had been scraped away. The old great names - the Torgaddon&#39;s, the Kibre&#39;s, the Ekaddon&#39;s, the Aximand&#39;s - they were extinguished. Those that had replaced them, Archeta included, were poor copies, divided among themselves, beginning to doubt and bicker even as the greatest prize of all lay almost within their grasp. </p>

<p>All except Abaddon. He had come through it all, if not unscathed, then still himself, the last link with the heritage of the Luna Wolves. No surprise, then, that he was listened to more than ever, looked up to by both the newborn and the old hands. </p>

<p>Horus had to come soon. He had to snuff this nonsense out. He had to remind the faithful why they were spilling their blood for him. He had to be the Warmaster. He had, in due course, to be the Emperor. </p>

<p>&#39;Just keen for dais to be over,&#39; Archeta told Baraxa, sheathing his whispering blade and making ready to march again. &#39;We&#39;ve destroyed enough. Time to start building again.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fighter before him was an Imperial Fist, but arrayed in the coal-black armour of their Templar Brethren order. Something about his presence gave his identity away even before he&#39;d laid eyes on the sword itself. Something about the way he carried himself, his stature, his movements - every figure around him unconsciously reacted to him, so that when he moved, they all moved too, like planets around a sun. His recklessly open stance might have been arrogant in any other fighter, but with him it merely fitted the aura he projected, one of complete and total focus, of immersion into the art of the blade to such an extent that no other way of being made any kind of sense at all. He strode across the wreckage in perfect silence, moving through it like a predator, his longsword eating up the meagre light and dragging it down into nothingness.</p>

<p>Archeta felt a spike of joy. </p>

<p>&#39;The Black Sword,&#39; he murmured, dropping into an attack stance even as his own blade screamed with hatred. &#39;I did not expect to come across you so—&#39; </p>

<p>He never saw the blow coming. It smacked in transverse, so strong so fast, smashing through his guard and knocking his whole body out of line. And then the follow-up, liquid like oil, punching up, cutting in, unbelievably powerful. The hilt cracked against his helm, running him, then a point first ram of the blade, two-handed, a wn nih, and blood was everywhere. The last thing he saw was a pair of red lenses swinging round at him, the ebon blade whistling for his neck, his parry nowhere near being close enough lo— </p>

<p>Sigismund gave the decapitated body a brief glance as it crashed to the earth. Before he could press on, </p>

<p>Rann, having despatched his own opponent, looked down at it too. &#39;A captain,&#39; he noted, impressed. &#39;Who, though?&#39; </p>

<p>By then, Sigismund was marching down the slope to take on the rest. &#39;No idea,&#39; he said. &#39;Keep moving.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wanted an opponent who was worthy of his time. He wanted a Space Marine, not a chewed-through warp monster. <strong><em>He wanted one of the old guard, not a jumped-up lieutenant in captain&#39;s armour</em></strong>. He wanted a meaningful trophy to place at the foot of the Throne itself, so that he could say that the architects of this galactic heresy had been handed their due reward.</p>

<h2>Theory: The Minotaur Legion is made up of none other than... the Loyalist survivors of Istvaan III</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/EquivalentInflation </span><span class = "numcomments">169 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/yihz54/theory_the_minotaur_legion_is_made_up_of_none/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(394)">View full post</button><div id="394" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been getting more into 40k lore, and I was reading through some lore on the Minotaurs, I found something very surprising. Fair warning, this may run a bit long. The theory itself is pretty simple though:</p>

<p><strong>The Minotaurs are loyalists from traitor legions who survived Istvan III. Due to them being tainted by association, they&#39;re not open about their survival, and are using the Minotaurs as a cover identity. They&#39;re kept for their skill at fighting other Astartes, as a &quot;Break glass in case of bad Astartes&quot; option. They keep the minds of their original battle brothers intact by implanting them into new recruits.</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s run through what we know about the Minotaurs first:</strong></p>

<p>Although a chapter of Minotaurs <em>did</em> exist long ago, this new version &quot;appears to bear little resemblance to accounts of its past&quot;. The lore hammers home that these are not the originals returned, but a replacement who took up their mantle and pretended to be them. This raises the obvious question about what kind of Astartes would need a cover story or fake identity.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this quote, which is pretty telling</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...the Minotaurs have long been the brunt of suspicion and acrimony by other Space Marine Chapters. Furthermore, there are those within the Ordo Hereticus of the Inquisition who believe the Minotaurs possess unknown ties to the High Lords of Terra. While much of the Minotaurs&#39; records going back over the last millennia have been ascertained through sifting through myriad battle archives from across the Imperium, much of their history before this point is not simply lost, but has been deliberately suppressed and sealed under binding edicts laid down by the High Lords of Terra that even the authority of the Inquisition cannot circumvent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lore also points out that any Inquisitor who tries to pry into the Minotaurs ends up dead. We can guess that either the High Lords or Minotaurs themselves are responsible for this, and it represents an intense desire to keep something secret. Killing major Inquisitorial investigators risks bringing all kinds of trouble down on your head, you don&#39;t do that just to hide your sparkly princess diary.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some people will say &quot;The high lords just want to hide their own private astartes&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t check out either. Everyone in canon already knows (or at least heavily suspects) the Minotaurs are tied to the High Lords, they&#39;re not subtle about it. Why would they be incredibly efficient in hiding secrets, to the point of treason, then make their secret super obvious?</p>

<p>Then, there&#39;s their training methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...another unusual aspect of the Minotaurs is the methods in which they are able to replace losses in manpower so quickly. The speed of transition between Neophyte, Scout Marine and full Battle-Brother in the Chapter is brief compared to that of many other Space Marine Chapters. This is explained by the use of extremely high levels of programmed psycho-indoctrination and neuro-cerebral surgery by the Chapter. This program accelerates the recruits&#39; progression and is continued during deployment as ongoing treatments to reinforce mental conditioning administered by the Chapter&#39;s Apothecaries... ...Most Space Marine Chapters consider the more studied training and battlefield erudition of their Neophytes to be a key component in tempering the soul of a warrior rather than the dangerous artificial techniques employed by the Minotaurs to replace their often self-inflicted losses.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to their chapter master being reported dead six separate times, but reappearing, it&#39;s mentioned that people in-universe have come up with some theories</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asterion Moloc has not been one Space Marine, but many down the centuries, each inheriting not only a name and panopoly as some have suggested but also, and somewhat blasphemously, an engramatically-enforced personality and recorded memories taken from many different lifetimes&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, there&#39;s the fact that their recruits really <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be able to be trained as quickly and as easily as they are... but somehow, they never see a dip in their fighting ability. They&#39;re even mentioned as being &quot;nearly always at full strength&quot;, even with little time between battles. It&#39;s also mentioned that they take losses other Space Marines would view as foolish and reckless... but Asterion is described as a masterful tactician &quot;measuring the drops of blood spilt in pursuit of his Chapter&#39;s strategic goals.&quot; That doesn&#39;t seem like the behavior of a reckless moron who throws lives away... unless those lives could be easily replaced by slotting their minds into a new body. And that kind of technology is heavily forbidden by the Inquisition, it&#39;s certainly worth killing to hide.</p>

<p>One of the single most notable parts about them is that the Minotaurs are trained and prepared specifically to fight and kill other Space Marines. Even more notable, they&#39;re specifically stated to <em>enjoy</em> fighting other astartes. They also show disdain for even Space Marines allied with them, and pick fights on purpose. Whenever any Space Marines go renegade, or are for any reason perceived as a threat (like the attempted coup against Robot Gorillaman, or that time the Lamenters had the audacity to continue existing), the Minotaurs are the ones to put them down, with brutal efficiency.</p>

<p>Their preferred form of combat is to pin their enemy to one place, prevent any retreat, then attack en masse, using attrition style warfare. They&#39;re also notable for doing this with their entire chapter, which they never split up, unlike all other Space Marines.</p>

<p>Those who have worked with the Minotaurs describe them being incredibly paranoid and suspicious, as well as taking actions that border on insanity or heresy. They also just genuinely don&#39;t give a shit about civilians or the rest of the Imperium, at one point using workers as live bait to kill Dark Eldar.</p>

<p>Despite all of their general assholery, the Minotaurs are fanatically loyal to the Emperor, to the point where they make the Sisters of Battle seem like friendly reasonable gals.</p>

<p>To a lesser (but still crazy) degree, they&#39;re loyal to the high lords of Terra. However, it should be noted that this obedience is never directly stated. They end up doing what the High Lords <em>want</em> a lot of the time, but it&#39;s left vague if that&#39;s because of loyalty, or because it aligns with their own goals (and the High Lords are their sugar daddies). During the attempted coup on Terra, they&#39;re happy to follow orders and fight the Ultramarines... but then when the High Lords are assassinated and replaced, they&#39;re equally happy to follow the orders of their new bosses, stopping the fight instantly, and later cooperating(ish) with the same Ultramarines they&#39;d shot a day or two earlier. It&#39;s also left a bit vague on if they were trying to help or stop the coup, and how much they knew.</p>

<p>They also, without getting commands, went and  started trying to restore some order on Terra, gaining the love of the people while doing so. It&#39;s unclear where their exact loyalties lie, but it seems fair to say that there&#39;s more going on than meets the eye.</p>

<p><strong>Next, we need to look at Istvaan III.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Istvaan_III_Atrocity#Onslaught">Those who don&#39;t know can read about it</a>, but TL;DR is that Horus and some of the other traitor primarchs sent any loyalist troops down to a plant, hit the planet with chemical weapons from orbit, then burned the entire planet alive, and Angron went to kill any survivors. However, the survivors were more resilient than expect, and Angron was more of a dumbass than expected, so the whole thing took a valuable three months of time, delaying the Heresy. There were also loyalists on all of the ships in orbit, who the traitors tried to purge with varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>During this, one very important event was the death of the <em>Minotaur</em>. Yeah. A traitor gunship that was returning from a mission on the surface transmitted the proper codes, entered the ship, and sent the message that it would &quot;avenge the blood of Terra&quot; before suicide bombing into a row of refueling gunships, killing a whole company of Horus&#39;s legionaries, and forcing the traitors to completely redo all of their codes and security measures, which bought vital time and confusion for the loyalists.</p>

<p>The question of how the Minotaur turned is still unanswered. It leaves three possibilities open. One, the Traitor Primarchs didn&#39;t know about all of the loyalists, and some of them remained anonymous long enough to sacrifice themselves. Two, they accurately found all loyalists, but some traitors had a change of heart after being asked to butcher their brothers, and decided to turn loyal again. Or three, some of the loyalists on the surface managed to get a hold of at least one ship and all of the codes involved. In any of those three options, it opens up vastly greater new possibilities for what the loyalists would be able to do. It changes the fight from a desperate last stand, to potentially covering for an escape.</p>

<p>Regardless of what happened, it seems fair to say the the Minotaur would be a potent symbol for any surviving loyalists. It represented their strength to keep fighting, but also their willingness to die without hesitation to take down the hated enemy. More importantly, the few men who died on it managed to save countless more lives (at least, for a time). So, if they were asked to come up with a new chapter, and they needed a name that would both hide them and honor their fallen...</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous bits of evidence</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Their Chapter head Moloc is mentioned wearing ancient Tartaros Terminator armor, a type that hadn&#39;t been worn since the Great Crusade</li>
<li>Moloc is also repeatedly described as looking as if he came from another time, both in his armor&#39;s decoration and his general appearance.</li>
<li>Their mobile fortress monastery, the Daedelos Krata is a relic-ship, dating back untold millennia... potentially to the Heresy.</li>
<li>Moloc and his Minotaurs are so deadly that <em>fucking Custodes</em> are threatened by them. Not just any Custodes, but Valerian, the hero of Lion&#39;s Gate.</li>
<li>The Minotaurs rarely, if ever remove their helmets to show their faces(new theory: they&#39;re Mandalorians, displaced from their original universe)</li>
<li>Despite Custodes <em>hating</em> the Minotaurs, they&#39;re both immediately willing to cooperate with deadly effect in Andromax. Some potential evidence of unseen motives.</li>
<li>Minotaurs can often fly into an unthinking rage, even going so far as to kill other Imperial allies in battle. This would fit with them being World Eater survivors.</li>
<li>There were constant rumors that they&#39;d suffered a catastrophic loss in battle at some point, but nobody knew when</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The survivors of Istvaan would make the perfect contingency plan for killing Astartes</strong></p>

<p>It makes a lot of sense. Istvaan was a situation where they had absolutely zero chance. They were forced to wipe out a Slaanesh invasion, then got virus bombed, then had that virus <em>lit on fire planetwide</em>, and then were hit by a personal charge from Angron, the most violent and unhinged fucker imaginable, backed up by Mortarion. And despite allllll of that, the loyalists held out for three months. Three. Months. Even for Astartes, that&#39;s damn impressive. More than anything, it shows that they&#39;re good at fighting other Space Marines.</p>

<p>So, if you were Jimmy Space or the Lords of Terra, and you realized that your super duper killing machines weren&#39;t 100% trustworthy, and you then found a group of astartes who had proven to be incredibly good at fighting said super duper killing machines, you&#39;d likely want to put them to use. We even learn that part of the reason that the High Lords wanted to launch a coup against Girlyman was because they (like many Imperium citizens, especially those on Terra) are <em>terrified</em> of Astartes. They&#39;re distant, alien forces, who can streamroll through any regular humans they feel annoyed by.</p>

<p>Their typical strategy also fits with Istvaan: draw your enemies in, get them all in one big area where they can&#39;t leave, and have a massive knock-down, drag-out fight of attrition until only one side survives. It&#39;s what they&#39;re good at, why change it?</p>

<p><strong>They could never reveal themselves</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, just look at the Lamenters, who get treated like the worst possible garbage by every other Astartes chapter just because of a forgotten &quot;curse&quot;. Can you imagine how the Space Marines would react after millenia of war, seeing these guys roll up and say &quot;Hey, we&#39;re Horus&#39;s old buddies, but don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re totally cool&quot;? Hell, the Dark Angels would probably just hear &quot;Horus&quot; and then immediately start a killing spree.</p>

<p>Whether this happened immediately after Horus&#39;s betrayal, or millenia later, the results would be the same. It was one thing for bits and pieces of loyalist survivors to join up with the Imperium, but a massive number of them, many of whom were high ranking or notable members of traitor legions? Uh huh.</p>

<p>This is why the High Lords took such massive pains to hide their history, and why they kill anyone even remotely suspicious of them. If their secret gets out, it means the death of their entire chapter. It&#39;s also likely why they only popped up years later (when no one could recognize them), and why they wear helmets almost constantly (what self respecting major character wouldn&#39;t go into battle bare headed?). Not to mention, anyone trying to find out about them would also then find out very specific details about the Heresy and Chaos, which would likely be enough to kill them on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Their behavior would match with survivors of Istvaan</strong></p>

<p>Trusting absolutely no one, and thinking that everyone you may be out to get you? Check.</p>

<p>Never wanting to separate from your brothers again, and remaining as a single massive unit? Check.</p>

<p>Devotion to the Emperor above all else, even their own brothers? Check.</p>

<p>Really fucking pissed off at the galaxy as a whole, especially anyone in armor? Check. (Remember, betrayed as they were, many of them still noted that they felt sorrow for killing their traitor brothers. Their grudge against other astartes seems to fit with that. Also, I&#39;d like to see anyone who could go through that experience and not be a tad bitter).</p>

<p><strong>They implant the personality and memories of their fallen brothers into new recruits</strong></p>

<p>As was mentioned in the quote earlier, their chapter master manages to keep coming back from death, causing people to speculate that they were implanting his mind into new people. And given the fact that they use massive amounts of surgery and brain fucking on all their new recruits, who then <em>mysteriously</em> become just as skilled as a veteran Astartes in a fraction of the time, we can see a pretty clear chain of events.</p>

<p>This is also why their chapter still has their entire identity based around Istvaan: because they are were there... just not in these bodies.</p>

<p><strong>So, how did these crazy bastards survive?</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s the big question, isn&#39;t it? After all, Horus &amp; co. were <em>very</em> particular to make sure they killed all Loyalists. And at least in canon, it&#39;s believed that there were very few survivors. However, from everything we saw, they <em>really</em> didn&#39;t do an efficient job of that. There were tons of loyalists who fought back in orbit or fled, and as Rhylanor proved, some could manage to hide deep enough underground that they wouldn&#39;t be detectable. We know that there were at least a handful of survivors on the planet&#39;s surface (some of whom Loken would end up killing), and that the tunnels were impossible to fully clear. There were also some who managed to steal ships and get off planet in small numbers.</p>

<p>The Minotaur&#39;s sacrifice may very well have been what allowed them to escape. After all, even if the loyalists had managed to find a whole fleet of ships, they&#39;d just get blown out of the sky. It&#39;s sacrifice meant that the traitors suddenly had no idea who was on their side and who wasn&#39;t, requiring several hours where all communications were suspect. In that time, they could manage to fly to freedom more or less unhindered. There&#39;s already evidence of some loyalists managing to get off planet in shuttles (like Crysos and his buddies) which supports this being a possibility.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the potential that they could have turned traitor, or at least gone along with it, but later regretted their actions and sought to redeem themselves, either by rejoining the Empire or helping their brothers escape. This would also explain why they could never reveal themselves to the rest of the Imperium.</p>

<p>So, suffice to say, there&#39;s lots of possibilities for how they could manage to get ~1,000 Astartes to safety.</p>

<p><strong>The only remaining question is &quot;Where the fuck have they been since Istvaan?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The original cursed Minotaurs were in 36,000, and the replacements didn&#39;t show up until &quot;recently&quot; (which could mean 2,000 years knowing the Imperium, but still). I have to admit, this is where we run into full on speculation. However, this being 40k, there&#39;s a lot of good explanations.</p>

<p>The most obvious possibility is just warp fuckery. They try to escape Istvaan, there&#39;s some weird space hell bullshit, and they pop out millenia later. This also may explain why they&#39;re often flying into unthinking rage: centuries fighting your way through the warp after being stabbed in the back probably wouldn&#39;t help your sanity or stress levels.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also just the fact that Astartes really don&#39;t die of old age. So the boring answer is that they could have been sitting around for millenia (by their own will or no). Maybe hiding out underneath Istvaan, with all of their ships destroyed, or maybe in some secret vault on Terra. They wait until they have resources together, until enough time has passed that no one recognizes them, or until they&#39;re called upon for some big secret plan, and then they pop out to be the biggest assholes imaginable. You&#39;d be pissed too if you got trapped on a desolate hellscape for a few thousand years.</p>

<p>Or, it&#39;s mentioned that being betrayed by their fathers and brothers drove some survivors to the point of madness. That would potentially make them unfit for service in the Emperor&#39;s eyes (or whoever was handed the decision), and would match with their reputation for going into mindless killing sprees. It&#39;d fit with the 40k grimderp vibe if the High Council found a cryo-stasis vault with a sign saying &quot;Insane killing machines, do not open, seriously&quot; and went &quot;Oooh, personal army&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Look, did I find the Minotaurs and go &quot;Hey, that&#39;s the name of the ship from Istvaan?&quot; Potentially, but that&#39;s not the point. Games Workshop is pretty clearly setting up a mystery with their origin, and the clues are there to suggest a far greater conspiracy than just &quot;they used some questionable gene seed&quot;. Their philosophy, tactics, and overall actions seem to connect them to Istvan survivors, along with their name.</p>

<p>Also, as a fun trivia note, despite their total and utter hatred of Astartes, their general galactic dickbaggery, and their reputation for never leaving an enemy alive, when they fought the Lamenters, the Minotaurs genuinely took pity on them, bringing them in for trial rather than killing all of them. It&#39;s darkly ironic that despite killing so many Lamenters, that still is better than 99% of the galaxy.</p>

<h2>The Dark Tongue</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Vezimira </span><span class = "numcomments">62 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/oex0kk/the_dark_tongue/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(612)">View full post</button><div id="612" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, it is Tuesday and therefore time for another lorepost. I am not tagging this one specifically [TS] as it pertains to a wider topic, though mind that most of my sources are related to the Thousand Sons. Without futher ado, let&#39;s get to it.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Dark Tongue?</strong></p>

<p>The Dark Tongue is the language of Chaos and Daemons. When you see cool weird runes inscribed on Chaos Marine armour, especially that of Thousand Sons Sorcerers and Rubricae, it is in the vast majority of cases the Dark Tongue. The Dark Tongue is written in a mix of logographs that directly represent a concept or a string of phonetic runes. If you ever studied Asian languages, the system is kind of similar to the use of kanji/hanzi alongside phonetic lettering systems.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a whole lot on Dark Tongue grammar in general, but Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned have us some basic information. The core of the language has relatively few words, but they&#39;re highly permutable. An example:</p>

<p><strong>Aqsh</strong> means red.</p>

<p><strong>Aqshy&#39;y</strong> means bronze or brass.</p>

<p><strong>Akhash</strong> means blood.</p>

<p><strong>Akh</strong> means battle, bloodshed, to slay in battle.</p>

<p><strong>Aksha</strong> means battleaxe.</p>

<p><strong>Ksy</strong> means key or solution.</p>

<p><strong>Iakash</strong> means lock or obstacle.</p>

<p><strong>Akhshami</strong> means secret.</p>

<p><strong>Aksho</strong> means to seek.</p>

<p><strong>Akhamshy&#39;y</strong> denotes slayers or warriors.</p>

<p><strong>Akami</strong> denotes guardians.</p>

<p>And on and on.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Spelling</strong></p>

<p>While we don&#39;t have a whole lot of words in the Dark Tongue, we were given a spelling system with a bunch of runes, and those can be used to write most languages. It is a little tricky when transcribing English, however; the Dark Tongue uses phonetic runes, which means you pronounce exactly what you see, which is not the case with English. My maternal tongue isn&#39;t English and happens to be a phonetic language, so I can demonstrate how you would likely transcribe English into phonetic runes.</p>

<p>Here is the system:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1AJrVZM.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/1AJrVZM.jpg</a></p>

<p>And here is the demonstration:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Wbm515E.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Wbm515E.jpg</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Numbers</strong></p>

<p>Large numbers can be written in two ways: either by repeating the highest known numeral the required number of times, or by putting a number denoting its repetitions before it. In practice, that means the number 200 could be either written like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rGePQlI.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/rGePQlI.jpg</a></p>

<p>Or like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/alBACX9.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/alBACX9.jpg</a></p>

<p>Both of which are correct.</p>

<p><em>Note: While the old lorebooks treat the numbers system as originating from the Dark Tongue, newer 40k books (Warzone: Fenris) claim it to be Prosperine in origin. What this means is up to your interpretation, though with how far back Tzeentch&#39;s plan to corrupt the XV Legion goes, it is entirely possible the Dark Tongue was an old influence on the earliest writing systems of Prospero.</em></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Lexicon</strong></p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a whole lot of words translated from the Dark Tongue, and some exist only in rune form. Let me present what lexicon we have.</p>

<p>Using these roots, you can construct the ancient forms of the names of the four Chaos Gods - Tzeeneth for Tzeentch, Nurgleth for Nurgle, Slaaneth for Slaanesh and Kharneth for Khorne. Those are supposedly the purest spellings of their names in oldest texts penned in the Dark Tongue, though mind that this bit of info was also written for the old Warhammer Fantasy lore, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p><em>Note: Nurgle has been referred to as Nurgleth in False Gods.</em></p>

<p>Not all of the above have known associated logographs; we mainly know the ones for colours. I have pulled those and some other universal words from the book. Here you go:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NaHgYO9.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NaHgYO9.jpg</a></p>

<p>So if you ever wanted to write profanities all over your tabards or call your warband the <del>himbo wizards</del> moronic magicians, now you can. More god-specific words can be found with a quick google picture search of the Dark Tongue, but those are fairly specific/specialized terms so I didn&#39;t include them here.</p>

<p><em>Sources: Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned, Wrath of Magnus: Warzone Fenris, Codex Heretic Astartes: Thousand Sons (8th Ed).</em></p>

<p>As always, if you have more information, throw it at me. I&#39;d love especially any mentions of the above topic in the 40k Chaos codices, but aside from the Thousand Sons, I didn&#39;t find anything from 3ed to 8ed, and that includes Chaos rulebooks, Black Legion supplements, Daemon army rules and the Warzone campaigns.</p>

<h2>Drukhari codex [9th edition] Guardsmen that survived being transported to Commorragh get hunted and played with by the dark eldar.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(663)">View full post</button><div id="663" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This excerpt is just gold, and exemplifies how extremely terrifying the dark eldar can be, specially the haemonculi covens, they are first class nightmare material in this excerpt:</p>

<p>Teeth. Grins. Pain. Falling, falling, falling. Darkness. </p>

<p>Colour Sergeant Pranda awoke with a scream. An unformed nightmare still coiled in his memory. He screamed again when he realised he could see nothing before his open eyes, and again when the pain hit him. A stabbing agony shot through his shoulder and across his chest. After a wave of nausea, he realised he was on his back somehow. Pranda&#39;s legs were twisted up against some obstacle, his head and shoulders likewise. It took several attempts to move his bruised right arm to feel around him, while he couldn&#39;t move or even feel his left. Behind his crooked neck, Pranda touched some hard surface and - groping blindly - sensed a draught move around him, over him, under him... under? He reached down and felt nothing, an emptiness through which a damp wind blew. Falling. The splinter of memory jabbed into his subconscious. Pranda had been falling. Teeth. Grins. Pain. &quot;Emperor, help me!&quot; he whispered, memory flooding back as feeling grew in his compressed legs. He&#39;d been taken on Coriola. Taken with, with... Throne, half the regiment! The sky had darkened and they&#39;d come like flying horrors from childhood fables. They&#39;d stalked from places that should have been secure, stabbing and slashing. Pranda had been in the third line, holding the company standard. Barbed chains that bit through his flak jacket had wrapped around his left arm and been pulled taught, dislocating it violently. </p>

<p>With gasps and stifled yelps, Pranda awkwardly inched his way upwards, bracing himself between shoulder and legs. There was a rime of mere gloom above him, delineated against the utter blackness around him. He reached what his painful back told him was the sharp lip of a horizontal surface. Pranda managed to grip a ridge before a sense of helplessness swept over him, magnifying his fear. When a hiss and rustle swept up from the dark depths, Pranda pushed away with his legs and flung his right arm over the edge. Adrenaline surged through his tiring limbs, tears covering his face. Something came loose under his scrabbling boots and he heard a screech below. Pranda hardly breathed as he heaved his body onto the ridged surface, crawling forward in the dark. He reached a hollow formed by angular buttresses and cowered, straining his ears for any noises of pursuit as his eyes panned over a hellish landscape. In shades of grey, bruise purple, dirty cyan and vague hues he couldn&#39;t name, a forest of dark spires and jutting spurs stretched as far as Pranda could see. To a city rat like him, it was like a thousand hive cities crammed together and somehow bent out of true. Blood-red lights winked in the depths and ghostly orbs hung far above him, highlighting every sharp edge in a wan illumination. He retched drily as the twisted perspective of oddly angled buildings disoriented him. Distant detonations and bestial cries echoed strangely, and there was a chemical stink to the air. It was like a battlefield at war&#39;s end, he thought, when the smell of blood, effluent, promethium and cordite all meshed. Pranda turned, his gaze drawn by sleek shadows swimming across what – for sanity&#39;s sake – he called the sky. </p>

<p>Now his eyes were growing accustomed to the ever-present darkness, he saw one narrow shape emerge into the pale &#39;starlight&#39;. Its sweeping curves and beaked prow moved through the gloom like an oceanic predator. With a jolt of recognition, he remembered being aboard such a craft, but could only recall fractured glimpses, sounds or feelings – the screams of men and women of his regiment alongside the simultaneously sibilant and rasping speech of their captors. He recollected eating and drinking something vile and shuddered at the thought. Then they threw us overboard. Holy Emperor, they kicked us off like we were already dead weight. Throne knows how far I fell. Pranda reached into the webbing at his waist for his personal icon, carved from a shard of shrapnel two campaigns since. If anyone was responsible for his survival, it was the God-Emperor, he knew – but the icon wasn&#39;t there. Instead he pulled out what looked like a short knife that wasn&#39;t his. The handle was wound with greasy ribbing, through which poked sharp spikes. Maybe he&#39;d grabbed it from one of the xenos before he&#39;d been pushed into empty space, he thought. He heaved in a breath, his mind clearing with the fresh pain from the needle-like hilt of the dagger. Gripping the blade and gritting his teeth against its bite into his palm, he crawled slowly out of his hollow, then set off at a run. A shout went up to his left, followed by laughter and swift footsteps. Pranda ran at a crouch, cradling his useless left arm. He squeezed under a balustrade and half-slid down a steep incline, recalling gang hunts from his youth where they would chase down some unlucky interloper. Pranda knew there was no hope in standing his ground, no permanent refuge. The only chance of living was to keep moving, even if he hadn&#39;t a clue where he was going. </p>

<p>He stopped. He breathed. He listened. Then Pranda ran again. Sloping alleyways twisted and forked. Dark portals yawned at every turn and the insufficient light shifted in colour and intensity, wrecking his sense of direction and sending his heart racing with every half- glimpsed threat. This place is a maze! Now he could hear movement to his right and behind him. Pranda breathed hard, the weariness of before swept aside, and even the pain in his arm and chest felt dulled. Skidding around a corner, he caught sight of running shapes that flashed through slivers of dim light. They darted towards a vast expanse spread out before him. It was some kind of plaza carved out between the monumental buildings, studded with man-high protrusions like the teeth of a micadragon. Pranda backed into the lee of a masked statue to avoid the hunters&#39; gaze. It was deformed and hideous. One of its three pale hands bore a ritualised blade similar to the one he still held. Pranda&#39;s own hand was now slowly dripping with blood from the multiple small wounds inflicted by the blade&#39;s barbs. Suddenly, three soldiers broke cover, dodging and stumbling between the tooth-like obelisks. Guardsmen! The light glinted on the unmistakable chrome helmet one still retained. She was helping her comrade, whose leg seemed broken, while a bare- armed bruiser guarded their rear, glancing about with obvious paranoia. It was warranted. Pranda could see flashes of pale skin and glinting weapons weave their way towards the trio, making the Humans seem pitifully slow and awkward. They&#39;re not going to make it! Run, for Throne&#39;s sake, run! Two graceful Drukhari, clad in tight-fitting bodygloves, leapt at the rearguard from separate sides. The soldier spat a curse and shouted at his cohorts to run. </p>

<p>A lash caught his arm, pulling him off balance before a wicked dagger sliced a length of skin from his arm. It flapped, still attached, as he flailed and screamed. Precise flicks of the Drukhari&#39;s&#39; curved knives severed the tendons behind his knees as the hunters danced around him, effortlessly avoiding his thrashing sweeps. The soldier with the broken leg stumbled onto his front, then yelled in shock, pushing himself away from the ground. Beneath him, Pranda saw the man&#39;s shadow bulge and then reach up, two arms grabbing his neck. The Guardsman struggled, weeping and screaming until he was pulled bodily into wherever the arms originated. A puff of vapour like chilled air was all that marked his disappearance. His helper, open-mouthed with terror, backed away. She suddenly broke into a run, away from her bloody comrade, but only managed three strides before something struck her shoulder and she was yanked into the air. Three Drukhari on anti-grav devices circled each other, one holding the claw-tipped wire clasping the Guardsman. She swung between them while each darted in for a cruel strike, cutting away chunks of flesh that rained down as she rose higher and her screams vanished. No, no, no! Pranda&#39;s limbs shook, his muscles cramped in fear and his skin crawled. </p>

<p>He crouched, trembling, unable to unsee the horrific ends of his fellow Guardsmen. It was when the fear reached its peak that the three-armed statue bent slowly down to wrap a wiry hand around his neck. He couldn&#39;t move. He couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away from the faceless, metal mask of the thing that held him. The pale, dusty and skinless flesh he&#39;d taken for stone flexed as the thing brought up a small device in front of its mask. He barely heard the whisper of the xenos&#39; own voice, but a chilling perfection of High Gothic was emitted by the device as the creature addressed him. &#39;Your gifts to the port are usually worthless detritus, already dead or too senseless to be of use, but my master knows surprises can happen. I&#39;m sure you like surprises, little thing, don&#39;t you?&#39; The skinned xenos easily prized the barbed dagger from Pranda&#39;s grasp, careful to avoid the stimulant injectors in the handle. Colour Sergeant Pranda managed a desperate, silent plea to the Emperor, but it would not be his last.</p>

<p>Beware, wall of text, bad editing, dubious English and very mild spoilers ahead!</p>

<h2>Understanding the weakness that sets the Eldars apart - and justify their arrogance</h2>

<p>This train of thought left the station as an aching to find where stood my beloved Eldars as of today. Once sold as the ancient, advanced and mysterious precursor civilization, they have fallen quite a bit of the wayside, and I know I’m not alone in this boat. Most of us, due to masochist writing and power creep, feel they are weak, passive and self-deluded, as recent inquiries on this forum as shown. Some lament it, other rejoice and find confirmation of prior bias in this downfall. Between the more advanced and ancient Necrons and the more advanced (let’s allow that to slip for now) despite being so much younger T’aus, what place can the Eldars fill without being squeezed by more photogenic factions? Not even considering DAoT Humanity, for obvious reasons an all time favorite.</p>

<p>True, they are a mere shadow of themselves, and yet so little is known about their golden age; Thus, this reflexion started as a question hardly answered, hell even formulated ‘til now as far as I’m aware of: what did the Eldars do for 60+ million years of global galactic domination to develop themselves and their mastery of (ir)reality? Did they advance, did they stagnate, did they really wield godlike powers before losing it all, and what great feat do they have to show of for this overly long period of time?</p>

<p>But before long, it grew in scope to encompass more or less everything creeping around this question of pitting vastly different societies and what they deemed worthy of achievement one against the others.</p>

<p>This is the paradigm I humbly submit to your appreciation today as an answer. I have always found the salt of Warhammer in the capacity the community has of mending the properly warping lore, full of plot holes and silent retcons. Please do contradict or correct me, as I am far from being an authority on anything: in fact, though being a midlife 3rd edition veteran, this is my first post on reddit and maybe on the whole internet on Warhammer topics. I greedily await more input to help flesh things up and set my head canon in headstone for good. Moreover, as I’m in short supply of precise quotes to support my claims, mostly working from memory alone, please do feel free to add what this makes you think of!</p>

<h2>I. On the shoulders of Giants: Eldar technology.</h2>

<p>Because in the realm of number relativism and power creep, what one can do is often the only meaningful way of measuring what one is worth: hence starting with technology.</p>

<h2>1. Stuck in the Middle Ages with you.</h2>

<p>So: what happened during the 60/66 million years of Eldar supposedly unopposed supremacy, that wasn’t enough to put their superior brains ahead of everyone for all eternity?</p>

<p>First thing we can question is their role in the advent of their own technology, as they are often portrayed as mere short-term tools for their Old Ones sugar daddies in their War in Heaven. Some even went so far as to deny them any proper genius, in virtue of being maybe genetically hardcoded for stagnation and folklore dances.</p>

<p>We do know that they inherited the Webway, but there is no reason to believe they did everything else. In fact, the argument that the Blackstone Fortress are Old Ones’ weapons and not Eldars’ is largely based on design and cosmetic incongruence with Eldar style, thus hinting they do have a hand on what they wield (duh!). Furthermore, two snipped from both old and new lore account for independent technological development:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“[…] this one assumes the smith-god’s gift to the Eldar was plasma weaponry? Hah! These events occurred eons before the Eldar had mastered such things. They fought with swords, spears and their own twisted version of faith.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Though the wraith constructs of Yme-Loc are but few in number, there are tales among the Aeldari that their weapon smiths have created a new and devastating weapon powered by the souls of the dead. It is a device so terrible in potency that Yme-Loc have never dared to use it. It is whispered that it can scour entire continents of life in mere minutes, the souls of the living torn from their bodies by a vast ghost-storm.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Best Source I could find:</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/a1m9h4/do_eldar_develop_new_technology_did_they_ever/">https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/a1m9h4/do_eldar_develop_new_technology_did_they_ever/</a><em>)</em></p>

<p>As far as technology is concerned, the Eldars are indeed capable of evolution and were not purposely locked in Rivendell. If anything, Dark Eldars prove them biologically capable of innovation, and the Exodites were even capable of eschewing almost everything and go back to dinosaur riding, a tribute to the Great Plains Amerindians who went back from agriculture to hunting-gathering when horses became available.</p>

<h2>2. How Old are the Old Ones?</h2>

<p>As a side matter, we can submit the Old Ones themselves to the question: how long did they take to reach the level we see described in lore? The stakes here, more than relative power, is relative time to achieve it. Who know how old are the Old Ones, and if their name refers to their anteriority or rather to the very antiquity of their own civilization? Behind is the question of the rate of progress: can it be as constant (or even exponential) as, say, Moore’s law, for millions of years?</p>

<p>In a Galaxy 13 billion years old, could the Old Ones be billionaire themselves, and if so, what does that imply for the pace of progress past a certain threshold? Can Blackstone Fortress considered to be akin to Project Manhattan: a new weapon, based on recent breakthroughs, stimulated by war emergency and specific threats, or did they only manage to experiment on genetic engineering to try and halt their doom through long mastered science?</p>

<p>This echoes in turn with the classic answer for the supposed Eldar Technological plateau: “their technology was already so strong that there was not much more way for improvement”. Yet they still lose on the poll against DAoT Humanity roughly one third of the time when the two rank against each other in the fanbase, and almost always when Necrons enter the fray. Indeed, they seems rather bland and generic in their weaponry, no doubt testimony of a more conservative time of game conception. How then can they not seem lacklustre?</p>

<p>Let’s see how our dear Humanity fared historically: limiting ourselves to the last iteration of Homo, more than one million years go from first encounter to DAoT, with only maybe the last 30 millenniums (Neolithic onward) showcasing sustained technological evolution. At the end of this timeline, psychic awakening began, but due less to natural evolution than Slaanesh’s gestation kickstarting it. Thus the time necessary to turn a whole specy psychic on its own remains unknown.</p>

<p>What about the Old Ones? We know they were fully psychic (or is that simply a carry-over of the Slaans from fantasy in my head?), master of a calmer (and arguably less prone to make itself known) warp, immortal toads of awesome. This begs the question of the time necessary to reach this pinnacle through natural evolution, if that’s how it happened. In their own time, the Necrontyr prior to C’tan tutoring had their own shortcoming: slow space travel (hint in itself of unfathomable time scales, as they still populated vast swathes of the galaxy), persistent short lifespan… At the time of contact between the two, the Old Ones had already finished their Webway masterwork, probably qualifying as the vastest megastructure on the history of the galaxy (and a bit beyond). So, chances are they were already olds when the universe was young, so it goes. Suddenly, 66 million years does not seem that much to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<h2>3. Giving is giving, render the rest unto Caesar</h2>

<p>But what exactly did the Old Ones for (to?) the Eldars? It is inferred they created / uplifted / groomed them for war against the shiny new necrons on the second part of the WIH, plus gave them access and later control of the Webway, and maybe to the Blackstone Fortress. Of the former, the Eldar are supposed to have the same degree of mastery than the Adeptus Mechanicus with DAoT science: empiric as best, superstitious at worst. They are said not to be able to do anything with it save use it, like the upstarts unmeriting brats they are often depicted as. Yet they do seem to master it to a degree: its architectural style if at least cosmetically theirs, they can repair it, extend it for a limited time, and seemingly reorder anything in it through portals and instant travels devices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Now and then they passed a branching route, the webway bifurcating through hanging gateways of gold and wraithbone, inscribed with runes channelling and shaping the psychic energy of warp space. There were other features: small tunnels that cut out great loops of the main channels; huge coils of raw wraithbone wrapped around the insubstantial tunnel in places the only evidence of repairs; occasionally the force walls folded and buckled, rippling with light as some malign creature of warp space intersected with the webway and was thrown back by the psychic ward&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Path of the Warrior</em>, p. 74.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Peering hard through the invisible force wall, Korlandril could make out the indistinct threads of other webway passages, twisting about this one and each other, coming together and parting like the strands of a thread. Of the squads using these other tunnels, he could see nothing.  </p>

<p>“How long is this?” he asked, his voice relayed to the other members of the squad.  </p>

<p>“Just a temporary burrowing,” replied Arhulesh. “We’ll be down on the surface  </p>

<p>in a few moments.”  </p>

<p>Korlandril peered past the shoulders of those in front, hoping to see something. In his imagination it would be a shimmering veil through which he would be able to see the trees and grass of Eileniliesh. Instead, the others flickered out of sight as they passed a certain point, and taking another step, Korlandril found himself walking on soft turf. He was vaguely disappointed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Path of the Warrior</em>, p. 78</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The Breaching</strong> - Vect causes the hidden portals that link each satellite realm and port-city of the Webway to be revealed, forcing them open and building the Great Gates: huge edifices that are permanently guarded by Vect&#39;s elite <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Incubi">Incubi</a> and <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Kabalite_Warrior">Kabalite Warrior</a> garrisons. […] Once Asdrubael Vect had brought the great port-city of Commorragh to heel in his coup over the noble houses he turned his attention to conquering all the other sub-realms in the webway.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>7th edition Dark Eldars Codex</em>.</p>

<p>It is unclear what exactly encompass this transmission of the Webway from Old Ones to Eldars, but the use of Wraithbone hint at a mechanism psychic in nature: maybe the growing of wraithbone was the true gift here, yet I do not know of any use of it beyond the Eldars themselves. Until we discover Vaul’s gifts are only plated blackstone on Wraithbone, we might as well assume that the role of the Space Elves in the Webway might be greater than what is believed. Rather than technological enlightenment per se, I feel it more plausible to speak of psychic attunement, or maybe cartographic help, but here the ice goes thin.</p>

<p>On the other side, the soon-to-be-changed-forever Necrontyr did get a vast tech boost from the C’tan, something that is overshadowed by their eventual victory over them. It is worth noting that before that, they were defenceless against the Old Ones, yet it did’nt tarnish their prestige as ultimate masters of the materium.</p>

<h2>4. Much has been lost in translation.</h2>

<p>On the other hand, the streetcred for Eldars past and future still does not compare well with others xenos, Orks notwhithstanding. Behind Celestial Orrery, chronomancy and reanimation protocols, it often boils down to “your basic infantry weapon autowounds on 6’, while my basic infantry weapon <em>autoglance</em> on 6’”. Shurikens can hardly compete with atomic shredding, that’s for sure. But is the comparison really fair? It is now time to explore what the Eldars lost during the Fall, and why they fell harder than anyone else relatively speaking.</p>

<p>Eldar “tech” rely heavily on their psychic might for power, but also activation. More than “tech” strictly speaking, it is truly akin to magic, as it sits at the crossroad between art and science. Hence the first obstacle to an unified technological scale ranking every civilization. All of this is well known: Bonesingers to this day shape wraithbone, one of the hardest material available and a true game changer in itself (as seen in <em>Path of the Archon</em>), rather than mass produce a set pattern of craft. Although automation was far more prevalent before the Fall (quote needed), it is not something that can be reverse-engineered or shared. Besides, much of their might came directly from the raw use of the warp, under the aegis of their gods, who, as manifestation of their psyche, prevented it from feeding the others, out of control deities set lose in the 31-41th millennium. Of course, they were blunt weapons too, destined to fight directly against other “god-grade” weapons.</p>

<p>With the advent of Slaanesh, obviously, all of this came to an end and everything became more precarious. No more safe using of full psychic potential to blast / create / communicate / you name it, and no more activation / control of the most advanced artefacts, like the legion of psy-lead automata that are said to fight the late Eldars wars (here though again, I’m at loss for a source). This instant regression is akin to the issue humanity has with AI: everything went off limits, or could only be used at great perils, all thanks to Slaanesh and the fading of the Pantheon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Space Marines were holding their ground in the open, allowing their less-armoured companions to seek the shelter of shattered tree trunks and deep craters. She let her mind touch upon the thoughts of the Cobra tank destroyer that lay waiting in the clearing, sending them a vision of the vulnerable Space Marines.  </p>

<p>Spurred by Thirianna’s instruction, the Cobra lifted effortlessly from the flattened grass, arcs of energy coruscating along its distortion cannon, throwing dancing shadows across the clearing. The skein bucked and twisted as the warp core opened, drawing in energy directly from the immaterial realm.  </p>

<p>Images of the Chaos realms fluttered through Thirianna’s thoughts; impossible vistas and baying calls filling her mind.  </p>

<p>The lead Space Marine tanks were almost three-quarters of the way along the valley. Lascannon blasts stabbed from them into the darkness, setting fire to trees, gouging furrows in the ground as the enemy sought the elusive eldar.  </p>

<p>With a thrum that set the ground shaking, the Cobra opened fire. The air itself screamed as the distortion cannon tore at its fabric, a rent appearing in the air above the closest Space Marine vehicle.  </p>

<p>Thirianna’s head throbbed with the pressure of the energies unleashed, the skein itself shrieked as it was wrenched into the material universe. The gap opened by the blast widened into a whirling hole framed with purple and green lightning, its depths a swirl of colours and reeling stars. Thirianna’s spirit stone was hot upon her breast as she felt the pull of the warp, the lingering power of She Who Thirsts tugging at the edges of her essence. <strong>To open the realm of the Chaos Gods was always risky, inviting terrible consequence</strong>, but the effect more than outweighed the dangers at this time. »</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Path of the Seer</em>, pp. 176-177.</p>

<p>Even at the nadir of their power (a word I learned as a child from the 3rd edition codex), a freshly groomed Farseer can activate (aka casting Guide on it?) a super-heavy tank at a distance by a simple thought (is there even a crew?). More interesting, the use of D-weapons is only licensed on dire circumstances due to the ever-present risk of fire incident leading to catastrophic distortion or daemonic invasion.</p>

<p>Now, before the birth of Slaanesh and the death of the Pantheon, such limitation would have had no reason to be. Indeed, with their perfectionist mind, the Eldars cannot even fathom conceiving a gun putting its servants at risk, like the Imperium’s plasma, as per every codex since at least 3th edition :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is a testament to the idiocy of Man that he creates plasma weapons that frequently maim or kill the wielder. Starcannons and suncannons have no such flaw, their plasma cores producing the heat of a star while the guns remains cool to the touch. »</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with distortions weapons, the risk of daemonic incursion (if there was even such a risk at the time of conception) extend the risk to even the aforementioned expendable automata. After all, what kind of war machine summons extra enemies by firing? Madness, you say? They. Are. Not. Orks!</p>

<p>Thus, we are now only a short step from assuming there was little to no reason to not equip the psychically commanded automata (at a time where soulstones could not even be made, so no powering living soul at stake) with more than a shuriken catapult or cannon, or even bright lance. After all, the wraithguard are toting D-Guns: why would they not have been the basic infantry gun of the Eldars of old? We do not know if that was ever the case, but in reverse the case is made that it should be a possibility, if not the logical choice.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the fight against the Necrons, would they have awoken before the Fall, do not seem all that much one-sided, on military technological ground only.</p>

<p>Yet all this is vain on a war between two civilizations able to extinguish stars or whatever. What about strategic advantage outside of the webway, then? Some kind of secret shenanigans able to render the might of the other moot? Well, Necrons bask in the glory of space-time manipulation, but the Eldars can do it too, with the same kind of safeguards that the Orrery has, i.e. causing more damage than it is worth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regret was misplaced on the skein. Here more than anywhere else it was plain to see the missed opportunities and squandered moments that passed by every living thing with each breath. The past, with its simple straight lines, fixed in place, could not be changed.  </p>

<p>« Thirianna corrected herself, remembering one of the early lessons taught to her by Kelamith. It was possible to change the past, through the power of the warp. Time in the realm of Chaos did not flow forwards and backwards. It churned and looped, and a seer with enough skill could, with great effort and a large amount of risk, move sideways from one flow to the next, and thus if gifted with a little luck, move his or her consciousness back in time. There was grave danger to the seer; channelling so much power in the heart of Chaos itself was an invitation for daemonic attack even with the protection of the runes. This was not the greatest peril though. The past was meant to be set and it was impossible to foretell the consequences of any change made. Only the greatest catastrophes could be averted in this way, yet such action led to futures that were impervious to prophecy.  </p>

<p>As Kelamith had concluded, it was far better to change the present than influence the past. »</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Path of the Seer</em>, p. 131.</p>

<p>All good and well, though you would think averting the Fall would qualify. Guess the decisive moment is stretched on too long a time period, the psychic apocalypse issuing is enough to obfuscate it, or Slaanesh’s own time traveling back to the War in Heaven do not allow it. Can she even be destroyed now that she has existed?</p>

<p>Hence Eldars powers are a fraction of what they were, but remains almost divine nonetheless. So, how are we to explain the constant loss of so many underpowered Aspect Warriors, while Eldar lifes (and more importantly perhaps, soulstones) are so precious?</p>

<h2>5. What you get is what your aim for, aka no pun, no gun.</h2>

<p>Here the idea of divergent evolution comes into play. It has been stated, in a futile attempt to settle the long debate on the technological ranking of Necrons, DAoT humanity and Eldars, that a definitive answer would be hard to provide and wouldn’t mean much due to the different path each civilization followed in its development.</p>

<p>The idea is actually great, though it does ring strange at first to we, that are used to pit units and factions against others, and cannot work outside the paradigm of generalisation of the most efficient way in closely intertwined societies on Earth.</p>

<p>It is made somewhat harder to understand by the fact that we have trouble figuring how a t3/4+ meatbag with a short-ranged disc-thrower could compete as a credible opponent against a self-repairing, teleporting before destruction 4/4+ terminator robot with atomic flaying death ray able to decompose a heavy tank. If no better solution has been found, we reason, it can only be because there is none at reach, due to technological or industrial limitations. Surely, the arrogant space elves that send their dwindling number to a futile death cannot emerge as anything else than utterly stupid and self-deluded in their claims of superiority, and that is why Eldars efficiency cannot be conveyed properly through the narrative, even in their own books.</p>

<p>Elaborating from the previous analysis of the fallen might of the Eldars of old though, it is possible to expand the theory to resolve the conundrum.</p>

<p>As for the perceived weakness of the Craftworlders (in lore, where there are more Shuriken catapults than scatter lasers in the battlefield), it has been said before that their major strength is the ability to chose their battlefield, their opponent, their time of attack, while knowing the future(s) unfolding as a consequence. That’s already something, that is not really felt on something like <em>Path of the Eldar</em> (and there was much lamenting).</p>

<p>As I have read around this forum, Craftworld forces are tailored for what is in essence a kind of special operations engagement: they move in fast, they move out faster. Hence the relative short range of lots of weapons, and the theorical emphasis on specialised semi-elite infantry, often of the melee kind. These are the poor sods that end up ganked by Space Marines more often than not, as everyone know, but it can (alas, it <em>should</em>) be ignored or lessened in lore, due to the synergy of the duo Farseer/Autarch evocated above.</p>

<p>The other, much more significant explanation, is that Aspect Warriors are not warriors per se, but rather something akin to shaolin monks. At the opposite of the Astartes, who are tailored and organized with a military goal in mind, that is to smash any opposition, spearhead, surgically mulch enemy HQs or <em>schwerpunkts</em>, the purpose of Aspect Warriors is first and foremost to master the inner thirst for violence that cannot be suppressed from the paroxysmic eldar psyche. It is the same quality that made them ferocious soldiers for the Old Ones, and allowed them to funnel themselves into psychic constructs and gods to take on the C’tans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is Khaine’s curse,” said Sellisarin, intrigued. He reached out a hand towards Korlandril’s brow, but the sculptor pulled back.  </p>

<p>“Don’t touch me!” Korlandril snarled.  </p>

<p>Sellisarin made soothing sounds and moved closer, meeting Korlandril’s gaze.  </p>

<p>“There is nothing to be afraid of,” said the Aspect Warrior, again reaching out his hand.  </p>

<p>Korlandril writhed as the serpent whipped and wriggled inside, urging him to lash out. He raised his hands defensively instead, warding away Sellisarin’s attention.  </p>

<p>“Leave me in peace,” he sobbed. “I’ll… I’ll deal with this in my own way.”  </p>

<p>“You cannot find peace on your own,” said Elissanadrin, sitting next to Korlandril. “<strong>The hand of Khaine has reached into you and awoken that which dwells within all of us. You cannot ignore this. If it does not destroy you, it could harm others</strong>.”  </p>

<p>Korlandril looked pleadingly at Maerthuin. His friend nodded silently, affirming what Elissanadrin had said.  </p>

<p>“This is part of you, part of every eldar,” said Arthuis. “It is not a judgement, not  </p>

<p>something that brings you shame.”  </p>

<p>“Why now?” moaned Korlandril. “Why has this happened now?”  </p>

<p>“You must learn to understand your fear and your anger before you can control them,” said Maerthuin. “Always they have been with you, but we hide them so well. Now you must bring them into the light and confront them. Your rage is growing in power over you. It is not something you can fight, for such desires fuel themselves. Nor can you expunge them from your spirit, no more than you can stop breathing. It is part of you and always will be. All you can do now is find the means by which you can contain it, turn its energy elsewhere.”  </p>

<p>“And keep it contained when it is not needed,” added Arthuis.</p>

<p>“Do not forget me, and not the Deadly Shadow, who gave you this gift. <strong>A pact you have made, with the Bloody-Handed God, he is part of you</strong>. Live well and train hard, heed the shrill call to battle, and return to me.”  </p>

<p>Korlandril bowed low, humbled by the exarch’s words.  </p>

<p>“I will return on the morrow, and we will continue. <strong>I cannot reject Khaine’s gift, and so I look to you to guide me</strong>.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Korlandril pondered this for a time, trying to imagine a universe without the touch of Khaine. The others continued to talk but he did not hear their words. He pictured Alaitoc free of bloodshed, free of the iron beast at its heart, the pulsing blood-wrath fragment of Khaine that dwelt inside every eldar just as it lay dormant in its chamber at the centre of the craftworld.  </p>

<p>He then pictured Alaitoc overrun, by orks perhaps, or maybe humans, or some other upstart race. Without Khaine, without war, the eldar would be defenceless. Little enough remained as echoing vestiges of their great civilisation. Without anger and hate, they would be wiped from the stars.  </p>

<p>“It is a dream without hope,” he said eventually. “<strong>Peace is merely an illusion, the momentary absence of conflict</strong>. We live in an age of bloody war, interspersed with pauses while Khaine catches his breath. I think I understand Kenainath a little better now. <strong>It is right to wish that the universe was otherwise, but it is foolish to think that it ever will be</strong>.” »</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Path of the Warrior</em>, p. 100.</p>

<p>As part of the path system created after the Fall, joining an Aspect Shrine is done to learn to manage the inner violence in every Eldar, both to use it and deflect it. War is institutionalised in the Craftworlds, like everything else: victory on the battlefield is but a secondary goal in the grand scheme of things, and one that cannot be accomplished by remote automata (or maybe it can, the way the farseer from <em>Path of the Farseer</em> feels the Cobra tank doing its thing…). That is because, even more than the destruction of their enemies, Eldars require destroying their enemies to quenche the thirsting gift of Khaine. If not, they might very well resort to preying upon each other, as shown before the Fall and in Path of the Warrior. That is why Jain Zar refuse to surrender herself and her people to Khaine once more, and why himself through his avatar declare themselves weak now (“There is no greatness left in this people”): they strive for true freedom, one they might not have even in their Golden Age, and due to their nature, it can only come through discipline and control. Though even then, there is no fully denying Khaine it’s due, as it would shatter them with as much certainty as diving head first into it.</p>

<p>Here we see that the Golden Age Eldars might not have been better in everything compared to their tamed descendants : like cultural apotheosis often comes when political hegemony is already fading, so modern Eldars are maybe coming more into their own, compared to being merely an hyper-effective weaponized race on the shoulders of giants. Like post-hellenic greeks, 17th century Spaniards or 18th century French, they reach their true legacy when their <em>hardpower</em> is waning.</p>

<p>Thus, a point we’ll develop further later, war is a cultural necessity in this mournful society always aching to prevent the death of its children. Another parthian shot from Slaanesh, as non-monitored violence was a core excess of the late Eldar Empire. Furthermore, waging war with aspect warriors is both mandatory and good for the health of the population, in a very organic way! Much more than the Path of the Outcast, it is a regulatory valve that prevent madness, crime and expunge the society of these calamities that would plague it, in this world and in the next simultaneously.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful twist that bring us back to the question of divergent evolution, through the fact that there is a case to be made that the Eldar Empire was the most pacific of all throughout the known history along with their progenitors Old Ones’, in both a paradoxical and very coherent way.</p>

<h2>[Excerpt: Saturnine] Great Unclean Ones aren't Papa Nurgle's most powerful servants. Not even close.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(766)">View full post</button><div id="766" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context: Jaghatai Khan, Constantin Valdor, and First Captain Raldoron have decided to go for a leisurely jog outside of Big E&#39;s bachelor pad in the Himalayas--along with several thousand of their buddies. They bump into some of Mortarion&#39;s very special boys, and everyone starts snapping their fingers menacingly before breaking into a beautifully choreographed dance fight.</p>

<p>Okay, no, that&#39;s not what happens--but this <em>is</em> the Siege of Terra, so it wouldn&#39;t be that surprising. Actually, Khan and Khompany are kicking a stupendous amount of Death Guard ass when, suddenly, something starts feeling off...</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The Khan heard sharp pinging. Hailstones were raining across them,
chiming like bells as they bounced off his armour, and off the plate of the
bodies around him.</p>

<p>He put a warrior of the XIV to death with a wrench of his sword, let the
body flop backwards, and looked up. Pebbles of dirty ice burst into powder
and grit across his face. The low sky was churning, pestilential clouds
frothing and souring. The sheet lightning became more intense,
backlighting the heaving clouds with a blue, photoluminescent afterburn.</p>

<p>He knew that blight-taste. Knew it too well.</p>

<p>‘Naranbaatar!’ he yelled, trying to locate his senior Stormseer in the sea of
mayhem around him. Hail was bouncing off everything like spilled ball
bearings.</p>

<p>‘We must go as we have come,’ said Qin Fai, reaching his Khagan’s side.
The loyal noyen-khan was smeared in blood that was running pink, the
melting hail diluting it.</p>

<p>‘Agreed,’ rumbled the Khan. ‘Sound it. Call it, Qin Fai. Let us draw back.’</p>

<p>‘Not yet!’ Valdor cried. He was close by, still at the Khan’s left hand,
demolishing Death Guard, who were tumbling before him.</p>

<p>He looked back. ‘Turn now? Jaghatai, we’re breaking them!’</p>

<p>‘They are breaking themselves, Constantin,’ said the Khan.</p>

<p>He could hear a thunder of hooves. It was not the drum-roll thump of
cannons that had made his charge, two days before, to resemble a cavalry
action of old.</p>

<p>It was actual hooves.</p>

<p>The massed lines of the Death Guard before him were breaking, but not in
overrun and retreat. They were parting to let something through.
Giant hooves trampled the mud. Antlers and horns loomed through the
smoke and hail, high above the heads of men.</p>

<p>The Neverborn descended. Brute monsters, warp horrors, cloven-footed,
broad-horned, their legs jointed like goats, their hunched torsos like ogres,
skins charred black and gleaming, their bristled lips drawn back from
snouts and muzzles, from fangs and equine teeth that slobbered foam and
spittle, and brayed and roared and squealed. Above those mouths, their
faces were autumnal masks of moth-wing patterns, brown stripes and
whorled dusty creams, dotted with asymmetrical clusters of spider-eyes.
From where he stood, the Khan could see eight of them bearing down,
hideous to behold, like the devil-daemons in old and fanciful woodcuts. Not
a single one of them was smaller <a href="http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2013/11/7/554310_md-Imperiator%2C%20Knights%2C%20Reaver%2C%20Scale%2C%20Titan%2C%20Warhound%2C%20Warlord.png">than a Warhound Titan</a>.</p>

<p>The sabre in his fist felt like nothing, as weak and useless as the ice flecks
melting on his plate.</p>

<p>He felt the true ice of terror in his heart.</p>

<h2>Darkness in the Blood: Blood Angel Lore Updates.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Ratwedge </span><span class = "numcomments">58 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/jqsmt1/darkness_in_the_blood_blood_angel_lore_updates/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(768)">View full post</button><div id="768" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The novel finally is finally released and we get some more knowledge of where things stand. The interesting tidbits has already been done so i&#39;ll just focus on some other stuff:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Developments in Space:</p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">The Blood angels do not need the Astronomicon to navigate the Warp.  The Sangiunor guides Blood Angel vessels through the storms and dying gods in the Warp. This isn&#39;t a secret, the bridge officer of one vessel talks about how a real Angel guides Dante through the Warp and Navigators do their best to follow it with the help of the Blood Angel Librarians. </span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Blood Angels use this ability to find lost fleets and Imperial forces and bring them back to Baal. We  learn Dante is creating a new Battlefleet called Battlefleet Nihilus and he wants the rescued Admiral and his Retribution class Battleship to be its leader.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Another interesting facet of Baal is Skyfall, this space station/drydock/defensive structure is literally a giant angel, 20 miles tall, holding aloft a sword 7 miles tall with wings outstretched and standing atop a planetoid which has a starmap of the Imperium carved onto its surface. Its being fixed and refitted to be a true Fleet Headquarters, however later on we see that due to the problems this side of the rift it is harder to refit and restock the fleet currently in anchor. </span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Inside said Skyfall we are treated to a scene where a brand new and more advanced Battle Barge, Baal&#39;s Fury,  is being built and outfitted with weapons. Thanks to Cawls design and technology exceeds its sister ships the Bloodcaller and Blade of Vengeance in every category. </span></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Developments between the Generations:</p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">There are three distinct generations in the Blood Angels at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">The  Principia, the reinforcements from The Unnumbered Sons and those created from the boys who survived the Devastation of Baal. The biggest clash in culture is the few  Principia left vs the veterans from the  Indomitus Crusade.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Much of the history and experience from the first Generation has been lost. Chapters  of the Blood have lost more than just men, their history, relics and traditions died with them on Baal. Much of what has made the Sons of Sanguinius over 10,000 years was lost on Baal and that is seen as a massive loss.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">The Primaris Marines themselves are Blood Angels in name only for the moment, they are too used to fighting and working alongside the Primarch and his forces and try to keep acting that way. They lack the grace, courtesy and poise of their Princpia brothers and generally don&#39;t act like how a Blood Angel is trained to be. Dante has to  remind them of this a couple of times and he doesn&#39;t hold back calling them out or using their rashness against them. At one point the Exalted Herald of Sanguinius, Dantes chief protector, has to openly chew out a Captain of the Blood Angels in front of his Squad and remind him of his place. Said Captain acts much more respectful after a couple tellings off and watching Dante do what Dante does best.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Its clear that some work in the future will need to be done to make the Indomitus veterans more Blood Angel like, but Seth was kinda right but for the wrong reasons. They act like generic Space Marines when they should be glorious and graceful angels. </span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">There is a bright light however, we see one of the newest generation of Blood Angels raised from youths who fought on Baal act like a proper Blood Angel when dealing with a situation on a disabled ship. There is hope yet for the Primaris if his generation can save the soul of the Chapter.</span></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Developments groundside:</p>

<p>&gt;! Arx Angelicum is being turned into a City. Once it housed a Legion, now all that is being covered up and filled with concerete so a proper place for both Adeptus Astartes and Mortals can be raised.  It will be bigger than when it was designed to house a Legion, now it will rule an Empire.!&lt;</p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">We see small details like how everything inside the  Arx Angelicum is sharper and has that new smell, because so much of the  Arx Angelicum  has to be replaced with new stone and metal, that the 10,000 years that smoothed stone and metal was lost to the Nids and much like the Sons of Sanguinius has to be replaced with newer materials not weathered by time. I appreciated the symbolism.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">The Chapters Masters who fell defending Baal are honored, heroic statues line the road and most surprisingly, alongside the others stands the last Master of the Knights of Blood. </span></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Successor Chapters:</p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Flesh Tearers, Angels Encarmine and the Angels Sanguine are the biggest forces left from the Successors. Some have been sent to hold advance positions, ready to reinforce the coming fight for the Red Scar. However Dante has sent and in some cases even ordered most of the successors home to honor their own oaths and promises.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">He will not let them break their word, they have their own people and worlds to protect and he will not be able rescue Imperium Nihilius if his first act is to force them to break ancient promises, promises almost as old as their oath to the Blood Angels. He points out that he knows how this dark age works, he was born in it and raised in and lived through it, he knows the politics of this better than most. </span></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>War for the Red Scar:</p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Basically read the supplement Blood of Baal, since this book is just before it. </span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">However a few tidbits, Hive Fleet Leviathian is still growing strong. Many of the Primaris want to strike now, clean out Kheru then take out the rest of them. They want to handle it like Guilliman handles it but Dante points out they have neither the resources or manpower to fight like him.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Dantes plan requires that the Blood Angels, their Successors and other Imperial forces hit as many locations at the same time, because they cannot give Hive Fleet Leviathan any time to mutate and change its strategy to counter them. Its either a all or nothing approach to saving the Red Scar. The Hive fleets are to be smashed and survivors harried, killing them or forcing them to expend more and more biomass to escape through the barren worlds then be hunted down piece meal.</span></p>

<p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Lastly Blood Angels and Allies are forced to suppress Genestealer  Uprisings because they cannot afford Leviathan being called outside the Red Scar by a mature uprising.  They liberate one planet from a GSC and then are forced to go to other nearby worlds and hunt down any GSC they see there to ensure their plan to win the Red Scar will not be placed in jeopardy by letting the Hive Mind know of some good quality biomass.</span></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>All in all a good book. It feels almost like an epilogue to Devastation of Baal.</p>

<h2>Deep dive into Constantin Valdor; the man, the warrior, the praetor.</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/THELEGENDARYZWARRIOR </span><span class = "numcomments">66 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/imk9lx/deep_dive_into_constantin_valdor_the_man_the/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(823)">View full post</button><div id="823" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will begin by disclosing my obvious bias towards this character and the very fact that I am writing this hints at my fascination and affection for this character therefore it would be advised to take this essay with a grain of salt. In an effort to combat my bias I will provide excerpts supporting most if not all my claims including the book name and author. I will separate the essay into sections in an effort for people to find what they are curious of a lot faster without reading the entire thing.</p>

<p>The question that EVERYONE wants to know is “How powerful is Valdor?” I will discuss his power in the last paragraph, however, I think he has a lot of merit as a character not only as a supporting badass in the lore. With that, let&#39;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>The Curse of the Apollonian Spear:</strong></p>

<p>My initial plan was to start with “The human” section below, however, the Apollesian Spear is so pivotal to the character that nothing else will make sense without first learning about it.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Mankind crafted two powerful weapons; The Apollesian and the Dionysian Spear both of which were wielded by the Emperor, but were created with the plan to give them to Constantin and much later on; Russ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Do you have names?’ Malcador asks, in a voice that is not yet scoured by the age and cynicism that will come.  </p>

<p>‘Two matched blades,’ comes a reply from the smoke, refracted and reflected, its origin uncertain. ‘Two principles. Intoxication and restraint, flux and stasis. The Dionysian and the Apollonian.’  </p>

<p>Malcador snorts. ‘Old gods,’ he says, ‘for a godless world.’  </p>

<p>‘It will not stay godless forever.’  </p>

<p>‘Perhaps.’  </p>

<p>The Sigillite looks more closely, raising a slender grey hand up to where the hilts twist. ‘You’ll bear them yourself,’ he says.  </p>

<p>‘For a while. But they won’t stay with me.’  </p>

<p>‘Who, then?’  </p>

<p>The smoke shakes as a chuckle wavers through it. It is odd, to hear mirth from those lips. One day, they too will be silent, held rigid in an eternal howl of agony, but for now they can still laugh.  </p>

<p>‘Opposites,’ says the figure in the smoke, lifting a hammer over the anvil, returning to His work. ‘In some ways.’  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Spear was not given to Constantin to make him more power, in fact it was the direct opposite, this Spear gave Constantin visions of the lives of everyone he killed, daemons, mortals, space marine. The Spear was meant to maintain Constantin humane, this may be my favorite quote of the entire franchise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Valdor walks away from the smoke, letting his companions finish their work. As he does, he senses the voice of his master in his mind, as so often occurs once a task has been completed.  </p>

<p>+You understand the weapon now,+ the voice transmits.  </p>

<p>+It uncovers truths,+ Valdor sends back.  </p>

<p>+It seeks imperfection.+  </p>

<p>+You gave it to me. It would be more powerful yet still wielded by Your hand.+  </p>

<p>Something like a soft laugh, though already colder than it used to be. +It does not magnify your power, Constantin. It checks it. Killing has been made easy for you, so it will do you good to be reminded of the soul-stories of your victims before you end them.+  </p>

<p>Valdor pauses, digesting this. He has never been able to contest any injunction from his master, and is perfectly aware of why that is.  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every kill haunts Valdor, he feels his enemies&#39; emotions, the Emperor curses Valdor to have to feel the pain of their entire lives in one second. It is my firm belief that few characters in the IP could have survived this spear for longer than a battle. All in an effort for Valdor to not become heartless, to not become over confident. Here is another great quote from this short story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russ looks up. His mane is matted, his fangs look blunt. When he smiles, it is gruesome, a wrenching of flesh once ruddy and apt to genuine mirth. ‘Still carrying that damned thing,’ he observes.  </p>

<p>Valdor does not know if he can ever let go of it. His fingers have been clamped around the grip for so long that they are hard to prise open. The illuminations still echo in his mind, thousands of them. He has killed thousands.  </p>

<p>I <em>am battle-brother Skarr-Hei of the World Eaters. My imperfection is my doubt.</em>  </p>

<p><em>I am Sharro of the Open Hand cult. My imperfection is my fear.</em>  </p>

<p><em>I am the daemon Bilebringer. My imperfection is my name alone.</em>  </p>

<p>‘Where is yours?’ Valdor asks. His voice cracks with fatigue. Even for him, this has been like a lingering death. He cannot forget what he saw on the Vengeful Spirit , nor what was lost on those Neverborn-infused decks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in Russ’s spear, I&#39;d recommend reading <em>Wolf King</em> by Guy Haley.</p>

<p><strong>The “human”:</strong></p>

<p>Constantin Valdor is possibly the most inhuman character in the entire lore of 40k, his apparent lack of any human emotion; joy, hate, anger and absolute indifference to anything not directly affecting his single duty is a firm belief among many who have ever seen the character be named. However, even the First of the Ten Thousand have shown the ability to empathize with human emotion. After the Siege of Terra, and the fall of the Emperor, the largest failure Constantin has ever endured he showed rather optimistic outlook while discussing the future and present with Leman Russ, the Primarch Constantin seemed to get along the most well with;Russ’ shoulders slump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘The greatest sin on Fenris,’ [Russ] murmurs. ‘To fail your jarl.’ And then, Valdor does something so out of character that even he is surprised by it. But then, this is a time of extremity, the moment when one epoch passes to another, and all but the most mechanistic soul cannot fail to be stirred by that. He places his hand on Russ’ shoulder, and exerts a faint pressure of reassurance. ‘It is not over yet, Wolf King,’ Valdor says, in as empathetic a manner as he has ever managed. ‘There are sagas yet.’  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is but a short excerpt from a very emotional exchange between the Wolf King and the Captain General. It shows Constantin&#39;s grasp of human emotions, and felt the duty to encourage Russ forward to give him something to hang onto and continue the fight.There are other signs of Constantin trying to be “social” an example is found in Two Metaphysical Blades where him and Russ have a lighthearted exchange after joint combat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sounds of carousing and brawling ring through the camp, and Russ himself has a chin glassy with spilled refreshment. He is no longer carrying the blade. ‘Constantin!’ Russ roars, clapping his hand on Valdor’s shoulder. ‘I’m guessing you won’t be having a drink.’ Valdor smiles dryly. ‘All the more for you,’ he says. ‘Have you borne it, yet? Into combat?’ Russ’s face instantly contorts into a scowl. ‘Blood and tooth,’ he mutters. ‘You’d spoil a jarl’s wedding night.’  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what surprised me the most was his behavior towards regular mortals, specifically Ra Endyminon’s mother, Amar Astarte, and High Lord of Terra Kandawire.</p>

<p>As we know Constantin was ordered to kill Ra’s mother for stealing ocean water and take him to then be trained to be a Legio Custode.However, Constantin gives her a chance to speak, to let her fate known, to have a chance to experience human emotion as opposed to simply killing her in her sleep, he even removes his helmet for her and gives her hope that her son will survive. This is Constantin Valdor, (at this time) the third most influential being of the Imperium, a founder of the Imperium, giving an insignificant mortal a few minutes of life, a casual conversation between Demigod and a dead woman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“‘Rise, minister.’ The voice was too low, too resonant, to be human, nor did it convey anything in the way of human emotion. If statues could speak, they would speak with this assassin’s voice. ‘You know that if I am here, you are already dead. Nothing will change that now.’ She sat up slowly, though she refused to slacken her grip on the gun. ‘Listen,’ she said to the golden shape in the darkness. ‘Negotiation is equally futile,’ the killer assured her. ‘But–’ ‘As is begging.’ That set off a spark within her. She felt her features harden as her temper ignited her courage. ‘I wasn’t going to beg,’ she said, her voice cold. ‘My apologies then.’ … ‘My son.’ She said the words aloud before she could help herself. ‘He is of an age to serve the Emperor.’ ...‘May I at least know the name of my killer?’ He hesitated, and she dared to believe she’d caught him with an unexpected question. Yet his dark eyes never wavered. ‘My name is Constantin Valdor...If you have any last words, I will ensure they reach the Emperor’s ears.’ Koja Zu’s lip curled. ‘Emperor. How I loathe that title.’ ‘He is the ruler of this world and the master of our species. No title is more appropriate.’ She bared her teeth in an expression too ugly and defiant to be a smile. ‘Have you ever considered just what kind of creature you serve?’ ‘Yes.’ The dark eyes stared on. ‘Have you?’ ‘The “Master of Mankind”.’ She shook her head, feeling the welcome flare of righteousness. ‘He isn’t even human.’ ‘Minister Zu.’ The golden warrior made a warning of her name. One she didn’t heed. ‘Does He even breathe?’ she demanded. … Valdor blinked once. The first time she’d seen him blink so far. That rare human movement was unnerving – to her it felt false, like it had no right taking place upon his statuesque features. He inclined his head once more, with a curious courtesy and another subtle purr of machine-muscles. ‘Goodbye.’  </p>

<p>‘Wait. What of my son? What is his fate?’  </p>

<p>‘He will be armed with silver, armoured in gold and burdened by the weight of ultimate expectation.’  </p>

<p>Zu swallowed, feeling her skin crawl anew. ‘Will he live?’  </p>

<p>The golden statue nodded. ‘If he is strong.’ In that moment, her trembles subsided. The fear bled away, leaving only naked defiance somewhere between relief and hope. She closed her eyes. ‘Then he will live,’ she said.  </p>

<p>Dembski-Bowden, Aaron. The Master of Mankind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context Aman Astarte planned in destroying the Astarte project, destroying the geneseed. Consantin was fully aware of her plans, however,  Constantin refused to give out the order for his Custodes to kill her until the very last second, Constantin gave her the chance to change her mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Valdor turned back towards him, and there was the spectre of a half-smile, briefly. ‘Diligent Samonas,’ he said. ‘Tell me of her.’  </p>

<p>Samonas hesitated. Some matters were delicate, hard to handle even for one of his training. ‘She is near, now,’ he said. ‘Closing on her objective. I completed my researches, and the threat is significant. If you were asking for counsel–’  </p>

<p>‘I was not. But give me it, since you’ve started.’  </p>

<p>‘End her now.’  </p>

<p>Valdor thought on that for a moment. ‘She is that dangerous?’  </p>

<p>‘She knows.’  </p>

<p>‘Knowledge is no crime.’  </p>

<p>‘In itself, no. But what is done with it, that can be.’  </p>

<p>Valdor moved away from the window. ‘No. Not yet.’ He drew in a breath, then winced a little. The air was antiseptic here, still raw from the cyclers, and was no substitute for the real thing. <strong>‘This is a new age, vestarios. An age of law. I will not succumb to a warlord’s urges, and nor should you.</strong>’  </p>

<p>Wraight, Chris. <em>Valdor: Birth of the Imperium</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly with Kandawire, Constantin knew she was a traitor, he knew she was planning on “arresting” him using traitorous Thunder Warriors but he explained himself to her, he answered her questions in great detail, gave her the chance to change her mind and in the end, when she was no longer a threat, he let her live. In <em>Saturnine</em> he also offered Dorn words of encouragement, promising he would get to retire and live in a time of peace after they defeat the traitors.</p>

<p>I hope this was a great summary of Constantin “humanity”</p>

<p><strong>The Demigod:</strong></p>

<p>The Emperor foresaw Constantin years before he was born as previously stated while discussing the Apollesian Spear, however, the Emperor sacrificed and risked a lot to secure Constantin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the many secrets Astarte knew was Valdor’s original name. She knew where he had been born, and what his parents had been before they had been killed. She knew why the Emperor had risked a huge amount to carry armies halfway across Terra to locate him, why the entire enterprise had almost come to nothing, and what had saved it. It was possible, though not certain, that Astarte knew more of Valdor’s early life than he did himself. He was so incurious, that one – a mask of duty, a mere cipher for the Emperor’s own will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wraight, Chris. <em>Valdor: Birth of the Imperium</em></p>

<p>Constantin is a founder of the Imperium,  he is the Emperor’s right hand man. Constantin knew about everything; Chaos, about the Primarch project, about the Astarte project before they were even started(I will provide evidence of this on the next section):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had been there from before the beginning, they said: the first of the Order, coeval with the Sigillite, the final element of the trinity that had brought a world to heel. Emperor, Sorcerer, Warrior.  </p>

<p>Wraight, Chris. <em>Valdor: Birth of the Imperium</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can tell from the risk that the Emperor went through that Constantin was a vital asset to creating the Imperium, aside from being the Custode blueprint, Constantin may have yet to play his ultimate role.</p>

<p>Constantin Valdor is unable to betray the Emperor, he is incapable of being his own man. He is fully and completely a slave of his cause, which is what I love so much about this character, absolute devotion, be it willingly or not, there is nothing else, but his duty, he literally cannot care about much other than his duty, he can only feel what his duty requires to feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Malcador looked amused again. ‘That has always been the promise. Do not tell me you regret it, or I might begin to doubt your commitment to the cause.’ If he had expected Valdor to be angered by that, he was disappointed. The captain-general merely turned away, sweeping his long cloak about him and walking back along the gallery, leaving the Sigillite behind him in the shadows. ‘How could you doubt that?’ he said, speaking as if to no one in particular, or perhaps to someone who was no longer present. ‘The cause is literally all I have. I can only hope, if we set out on this new course now, that we can say the same for these… sons.’  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Sure it wasn’t.’ Ushotan spasmed, hacking up oily blood. ‘You know, when we were at Maulland Sen, and I said I pitied you, I meant it. I’m not trying to goad you. I really do pity you.’ Valdor remained motionless for a moment, his hand on the grip of the knife. ‘I lived, captain-general,’ Ushotan rasped. ‘It was short, and it was painful, but by the nine hells, I lived. I’d rather have it that way than yours – no joy, no hate, no fear. Unbreakable without growth, immortal without passion.’... ‘What is left for you, Constantin?’ Ushotan breathed, blood bubbling up between his burned lips. ‘What more can He take from you that He hasn’t already?’ Valdor drew in a long breath, then plunged the knife in, ending the primarch’s agony. For a moment he did nothing else, his head bowed, the storm exhausting itself around him and coating the land in a film of pale, drifting grey. Then, slowly, he withdrew the blade. ‘Nothing,’ he said, very softly. ‘Nothing at all.’ “  </p>

<p>He does not do things because he needs to, but because he HAS to, Constantin wants have zero input in his important decisions. He is past that petty human drive: from forcing his Custodes to keep their armor in top shape, while disliking the way over the top design and engraving to his own breaching of his “moral code” for his missions it is insane how far he is removed from mortal weaknesses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the earliest of days he wore what could be fashioned for him, but as martial strength has grown, so has capability. He wears the Gold now, shaped around his body like a lover’s embrace, as tight to his sinews as his own skin. It is believed by those who know of the balance of powers, those of the past and the future, that no more than a handful of souls shall ever be capable of matching Constantin Valdor when wearing that armour, for in him is the past and present combined, ground down towards a singularity of perfection, though he himself can never recognise it, for he notices only flaws.</p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he had been capable of arrogance, he might have revelled in the results. As it was, he had not had a single arrogant thought since the dawn of his new life-state. He had never taken pleasure in his capability, nor his equipment, only a kind of blunt satisfaction when an obstacle was removed, or an order followed, or a threat despatched. And yet, there were half-memories – dim ones, like snuffed candles – of the time before. He almost remembered what it was like to dream his own dreams, or to feel the hot spikes of jealousy, rage or avarice. They had become intellectual constructs, those emotions, but still they were far from unintelligible. In rare moments of introspection, he found himself wondering how much he had lost in order to gain the powers he had, and whether the bargain was one he would ever have made himself, given the choice. Such thoughts did not last long. Every fibre of his being was set against them. Within moments, the obsessions would crowd in again, and he would attend to his fine armour, and attend to the mastery of his superb weapons, and attend to the condition of his already superlative body. As he did so, the old words would cycle through his mind, over and over, like a mantra of one of the religions he himself had helped to scour from existence. You are the bringer of the new age. <em>You are the warden of the old. You are the destroyer. You are the preserver.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wraight, Chris. <em>Valdor: Birth of the Imperium</em></p>

<p>I think the most impressive thing about Constantin is his lack of pride. Even after being closer than the Emperor, even after everything he has achieved, he allows himself to be looked down, kicked to the curb and insulted by Primarchs, in order to avoid issues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘You think I should have challenged the Lord Commander.’ Valdor turned to face him. ‘Do you believe, truly, that I would not have been up to the contest?’  </p>

<p>‘Far from it, lord.’  </p>

<p>‘You and I have witnessed the results of strife between brothers. No alien power did this to us – we turned on one another, driven by pride and human resentment. I will not add to it.’  </p>

<p>Samonas bowed. He could understand that, but still the insults rankled.  </p>

<p>‘So what now?’ he asked cautiously.  </p>

<p>‘The Emperor will speak again,’ said Valdor. ‘He repairs what we were unable to preserve. The silence will not last. Until then, our task is to endure.’  </p>

<p>‘Nothing more than that?’  </p>

<p>Valdor’s lips creased in the approaches of a smile. ‘You wish for more.’ He looked up into the heavens, to where shoals of atmospheric transports hovered between wings of gunships. A far greater fleet had mustered beyond sight, standing guard over the Throneworld, set against the coming hour of attack. ‘We saw the Eighteen arrive, we saw them fall, we will see them slip away again. What they perceive as weakness is what shields us from their mistakes.’  </p>

<p>The sunset deepened, and shadows pooled between the spires.  </p>

<p>‘Both of them invoked Magisterium, Dorn and Russ,’ Valdor said. ‘They think of that as the exercise of power. I do not blame them – they are creatures of power, built to dominate. But they are wrong. The term is older than that. It is the interpretation of the truth, discovered through communion with the source. We are interpreters of it, not masters. We are slaves to it. That is our first lesson. All others are secondary.’  </p>

<p>“ Wraight, Chris. <em>Magisterium</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>His Single “Regret”</strong></p>

<p>In short: letting the Primarchs be born. Now, now, I know this is a big statement, but it is true. Constantin disliked Primarchs since they first time the Emperor told him about his idea to create them. He also disliked Astartes since the very first time he led them into a fight. Here it is in his own words:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘We were faithful,’ Valdor said quietly. ‘I watched, while your brotherhood was created. I studied you. I saw the dangers in you from the start, and witnessed the way you fought, and acted, and quarrelled. And still I said nothing. If there had been a time to question an order, perhaps it was then. But the moment passed, and your great success came soon afterwards. I will be honest now, for you have been honest with me. I did not believe you would ever be that deadly. I saw how swiftly you conquered worlds, and said to myself, perhaps this is why you were made in the way you were. That was your great victory – you became untouchable.’  </p>

<p>Dorn listened warily. Samonas did also.  </p>

<p>‘But now we see the errors implicit in your forging,’ Valdor said. ‘I should have spoken earlier. By the time war came to this place, the moment had passed, and we were all trapped by our fates. You say that the defence of the tunnels was doomed? Perhaps so. I have fought in other wars – more than you will ever know – that were also doomed, and they always played some part in His pattern. I still cleave to that. The only element that could not be accounted for–’ and there he looked directly at Dorn – ‘was you.’ ” Wraight, Chris. <em>Magisterium</em>  </p>

<p>Here is Dorn laughing at Valdor for obeying the Emperor’s order and causing Constantin to be honest with Dorn, letting him know that the Emperor is not the problem, they are.Its important to remember Constantin is much much older than the Primarchs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the same book speaking of Russ killing Magnus:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘He has unleashed something he does not understand,’ Valdor said, staring at the distant Russ and speaking slowly and deliberately. ‘Just as Magnus did before him. What is it with them all? Where did they get this monstrous pride? ’  </p>

<p>More flagstones cracked, and Samonas heard the sighing creak of breaking stone. There was no sign of the primarch of the Thousand Sons now, only the endless bellows of his assassin. He lurched over to Valdor across the tilting flags, daring to reach out to pull him back from the edge.  </p>

<p>But at last the captain-general turned away. As the debris of a world’s demise blew about them in furious eddies, he finally reached up to remove his helm. It came loose with a hiss, and Valdor inhaled the first unfiltered air of doomed Prospero.  </p>

<p>The captain-general was furious. Never before had Samonas witnessed such raw anger on that normally implacable face.  </p>

<p>‘They are the architects of this,’ Valdor said, speaking to the storm. ‘All of them.’  </p>

<p>He turned to look at his thrall.  </p>

<p>‘It could have been prevented,’ he said grimly. ‘Yet when the hour came, we merely watched them being born.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Again Constantin seems to show regret about not advising the Emperor to not create the Primarchs unfortunately, he did not.</p>

<p><strong>How powerful is Constantin Valdor</strong></p>

<p>I am biased on this, very much so. Because of this, I will not do anything more than post a few excerpts and allow you to arrive to your own conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How easy, all of a sudden, to see how <strong>Constantin Valdor, the Captain-General of the Custodian Guard, was considered an equal of the primarchs themselves in matters of blade-work</strong>, when any Custodian could be as skilled as this.  </p>

<p>Dembski-Bowden, Aaron. <em>The Master of Mankind</em>  </p>

<p>He wears the Gold now, shaped around his body like a lover’s embrace, as tight to his sinews as his own skin. <strong>It is believed by those who know of the balance of powers, those of the past and the future, that no more than a handful of souls shall ever be capable of matching Constantin Valdor when wearing that armour, for in him is the past and present combined, ground down towards a singularity of perfection</strong>, though he himself can never recognise it, for he notices only flaws.  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight  </p>

<p>For an instant, Valdor hesitates. <strong>This slice of time is not perceptible to the one he will kill, nor to her minions, nor even, perhaps,</strong> <strong>to his own troops</strong>. He hesitates because his spear is illuminating him. Amid the motion and the counter-motion, its point is held still, and in that second you might think that everything in creation revolves around it.  </p>

<p><em>Two Metaphysical Blades</em> by Chris Wraight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is after the Siege of Terra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Valdor does not know if he can ever let go of it. His fingers have been clamped around the grip for so long that they are hard to prise open. The illuminations still echo in his mind, thousands of them. He has killed thousands  </p>

<h2>Corax is pretty damn cool</h2>

<p>After a long life of bloodshed and devotion to the True Gods there was little
that awed Kalta-Ar. The sight of the two primarchs battling within the empyrean
sphere left him shocked and breathless.</p>

<p>Infused with the raw primordial force, the combatants were ablaze with power.
Corax seemed a towering storm wreathed in white lightning, the cloud formed of
multitudinous ravens. Their cawing was deafening, the flash of their talons and
beaks the spark of the tempest.</p>

<p>Into the shadow Lorgar rose like a fireball, alight with a tornado of burning
rune shapes. Meteoric sigils rained down on the raven tempest, cleaving emberedged furrows through the dense mass. They slammed into the buildings around
the bridge-arch, shattering masonry, incinerating the corpses of Corax&#39;s victims.</p>

<p>The Ravenlord struck back, hails of flaring claws ripping the air itself, leaving
rents through the rune-robe of the Urizen. Each stroke left a shriek in its
aftermath that shredded the nerves as much as the talons shredded Lorgar&#39;s
immaterial form.</p>

<p>Kalta-Ar flinched when the sweeping head of the Word Bearer&#39;s mace slammed
into the chest of his storm-wreathed foe. The impact was greater than any
thunderclap, levelling the walls around them.
Rolling to his back, shattered stone pouring from his armour, the Dark Apostle
watched the titanic combatants soar past, Corax with a quartet of gleaming
spear-talons driven through Lorgar&#39;s throat. The Urizen tried to lash out with his
mace but was held close by the Ravenlord&#39;s inhuman grip.</p>

<p>Together they crashed to the ground, their impact flattening again the few Word
Bearers that had regained their feet.</p>

<p>&#39;The portal-bridge!&#39;</p>

<p>Marduk&#39;s shout drew Kalta-Ar&#39;s attention to the wavering energy field within
the archway. Dark sparks rippled across its fluctuating surface. It was visibly
weakening.</p>

<p>&#39;We cannot be trapped here,&#39; declared the Dark Apostle stepping towards the
waning portal.</p>

<p>&#39;It is sustained by the Urizen&#39;s will,&#39; declared Marduk, intercepting him. &#39;It
means our master is losing his power!&#39;</p>

<p>The two primarchs had assumed fully humanoid form again in the heart of the
crater their fall had made. Lorgar&#39;s left shoulder sagged, his rod swaying low in
his grasp. Rune-shapes crawled across his form, no longer a robe of office but
forming armoured plates etched with warp-symbols.</p>

<p>Corax flexed claws like sword blades, his expression pitiless as he took a step
towards Lorgar.</p>

<p>Marduk opened fire.</p>

<p>The flare of his combi-bolter hit the Ravenlord in the chest and face, a welter of
detonations that rocked his stride. Kalta-Ar fired his plasma pistol on instinct,
the blast hitting Corax in the midriff, splashing cerulean energy across his ornate
black war-plate.</p>

<p>Other fire joined it, missiles and more bolts from Marduk&#39;s guard.
Lorgar summoned a nimbus of power and threw out a shield of force that lifted
Corax from his feet, buckling his wings in the unearthly hurricane. The
Ravenlord became a flock once more of fire-eyed black birds, but the swell of
Lorgar&#39;s will continued to hurl the other primarch&#39;s incarnations upwards,
scattering them to the sky.</p>

<p>&#39;Quickly, our lord,&#39; shouted Marduk.</p>

<p>Lorgar lumbered towards them, his wounds streaming tiny crimson runes like
blood.</p>

<p>Kalta-Ar looked up. The Ravenlord gathered again into a single mass, a dark
comet headed directly for them.</p>

<p>The Urizen was first through the portal, his massive frame leaving a shadow of
his passing as the other Word Bearers dashed through after. Kalta-Ar lunged the
last few strides, throwing himself headlong into the miasma under the arch as
chill shade swallowed him.</p>

<p>He found himself in a large chamber, colourful mosaic underfoot, the walls
covered with fresh murals, white vaulted ceiling and domes far above. Part of
the Templum Inficio. He had no time for his surroundings, eyes drawn back to
the gate.</p>

<p>Shrieking, the raven flock scratched and pecked, but they could not pass the
warp barrier.</p>

<p>Lorgar glared at the apparition on the far side, chest heaving as though out of
breath, his head crowned with a halo of black warp fronds.</p>

<p>Corax assumed his mortal shape again, one cheek bloodied and bruised, his eye
almost closed. There was much damage to his armour, but he leaned close to the
portal, eyes boring through the divide.</p>

<p>&#39;I have your scent now, Lorgar,&#39; growled the Ravenlord. His face contorted with
monstrous rage. &#39;I will find you, Lorgar! I will destroy you and every vessel you
have filled with your taint!&#39;</p>

<p>Lorgar staggered away and the portal arch fell dull, leaving only bare stone
within its pillars.</p>

<p>This has given me ample opportunity to delve deep in 40k lore and now I&#39;ve plenty of time on my hands.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already ordered some new Ciaphas Cain novels, I&#39;m up-to-date on Gaunt&#39;s Ghosts and I can&#39;t get enough of most of Abnett&#39;s other work. I keep hearing Aaron Demski-Bowden mentioned as a top-notch novelist, are any of his worthy of a read? And if so, what would you recommend?</p>

<p>Also, apparently it&#39;s my cakeday, hence the courage to toss this one up. Life has dealt us a rough hand and this community has been a highlight for quite some time now. So for what it&#39;s worth:</p>
