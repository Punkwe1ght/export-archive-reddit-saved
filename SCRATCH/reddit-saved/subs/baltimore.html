<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve been looking at buying a home in Baltimore City and have come across a myriad of down payment assistance options. There are probably close to a dozen out there waiting to be redeemed and none of them seem to exclude you from qualifying for others. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve just got questions about the process in general.</p>

<p>How did the closing work? A lot of these programs seem to not kick in until final pricing is agreed upon and under contract. Did you still need funds to cover closing costs?</p>

<p>Contacting people over email has just simply not worked, I&#39;ve gotten no responses from any contacts. Did you have any different luck through phone calls?</p>

<p>What was the easiest to qualify for and what was the hardest?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a first time homebuyer, curious, and tempted by the sounds of 0% loans that cover a portion of the cost of home ownership. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Welcome to Baltimore!</p>

<p>Pro tip: For BGE (Baltimore Gas and Electric) the thing you should know is that you can actually save money by changing which electricity supplier that you want BGE to use for you. It literally takes 2 minutes to switch it on the website. It is pretty common for renewable energy suppliers to actually be cheaper than BGE&#39;s standard rate (for example I pay around 7.9cents per kWh from Clearview for all-renewable energy vs around 9.5 per kWh for BGE&#39;s standard &quot;dirty&quot; coal power, which is basically a <em>20 percent discount</em> on electricity). Basically, you tell BGE which supplier to use, you will still be billed normally (at the cheaper rate) through BGE but the money goes the supplier and they provide the energy from cleaner resources into BGE&#39;s grid.</p>

<p>More info how to do it here: <a href="http://www.baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/renewable-energy/">http://www.baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/renewable-energy/</a></p>

<p>I am not affiliated with BGE in any way, just figured this out earlier this year and I am trying to tell everyone I can.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: You can pay less for electricity AND get it from a renewable source. Takes 2 minutes to make change on BGE.com</strong></p>

<p>Bike ride up the Maryland Ave cycletrack and Falls Rd/Jones Falls Trail from Downtown/Mt Vernon up to Hampden. Finish by treating yourself to some ice cream or coffee or craft beers in the area. (Recently did this with a friend and had a lot of fun). You can rent a Baltimore Bike Share electric/regular bike to do it or use your own bike.</p>

<p>Archery at Vingt Neuf Bowmen in White Marsh (we&#39;re doing this soon, its $12 for two people, they provide all equipment and during the winter its indoors in a heated hall)</p>

<p>Earth Treks has outdoor rock climbing classes in the area (Carderock, Great Falls, etc)</p>

<p>Take a cooking class together at Baltimore Chef School or Schola</p>

<p>Take a class together at Station North Tool Library or Baltimore Jewelry Center</p>

<p>Sip and Paint classes at SAND Gallery (near Shot Tower Metro station)</p>

<p>Hike or trail run together in Stony Run (route now has pedestrian bridges connecting the northern and southern sections) behind JHU (closest nature trail in Baltimore city, it&#39;s really nice!)</p>

<p>Take a sailing class together at the Downtown Sailing Center</p>

<p>Lots of fitness classes all over Baltimore city - The Movement Lab (new in Remington) looks particularly cool.</p>

<p>My SO hates it (haha!), but you may enjoy acroyoga classes which can be fun for couples :) there are classes at Baltimore Yoga Village and at Earth Treks.</p>

<p>Dance classes at Mobtown Ballroom. Live music and various kinds of swing dance.</p>

<p>Recurring dance parties: Save Your Soul dance party at Lithuanian Hall or 4 Hours of Funk at The Windup Space</p>

<p>Catch an Underground Hip Hop show (if you like that sorta thing): Baltimore Beat Club at LineUp Room, Baltimore Boom Bap Society at The Windup Space have monthly performances</p>

<p>Volunteer at a Civic Works, Baltimore Tree Trust/Tree Baltimore or similar nonprofit event. Lots of urban gardening, tree planting, building parks, etc.</p>

<p>Ukelele class at Creative Alliance</p>

<p>Try a clay throwing/ceramics class at Baltimore Clayworks in Mt Washington</p>

<p>Baltimore Bike Party!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am always looking for good local restaurants to check out, and reasons to explore more of this great city. Someone told me about how EPCOT in Florida has all of their themed restaurants, which made me wonder if I could do something even better without leaving Baltimore. Turns out the answer is a much more empathetic &#39;yes&#39; than I would have expected. </p>

<p>I decided to do some exploring on Google Maps and see what places I could find to turn 2017 into &#39;Baltimore Around the World&#39;. I had a few criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try as many ethnicities of food as possible</li>
<li>Try to spread them over the city as much as possible. I tended to lean toward areas I liked better, so Hamden, had an unfortunate leg down on this. Also, areas like Roland Park aren&#39;t really what I go for... my experiences there have felt more like the suburbs, which isn&#39;t what I was going for. </li>
<li>Lean away from chains, although there were a couple where they were the only options. </li>
<li>Spread between expensive places and more affordable places. Most were on the low to medium end, but I wanted to make sure the food still looked good. Not really looking for take out (hence why I left Chinese blank... not sure on that one).</li>
<li>Big bonus points for neighborhood holes in the wall. Might be tricky when I am searching on Google Maps, but that was the goal. </li>
<li>Also, slight bonus points if I haven&#39;t been there before. </li>
</ol>

<p>Here it is.</p>

<p>Are there any tricks to buying them? I assume they should be males and the larger the crab the better. I&#39;d only be buying a dozen or so. Are the prices significantly cheaper for live vs just going to a place that sells steamed crab? I think I paid $7.45 for a jumbo at LP Steamers.</p>

<p>Better yet, are there any places along the water I could drive to where they sell crab from the day&#39;s catch?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to LP Steamers, had pit beef at Chap&#39;s, had lobster roll at Thames, and had crab cakes at Koco&#39;s. Anything else I should try while I&#39;m here?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you head east of Greektown there&#39;s my hood, Bayview (formerly Joseph Lee), which I freaking love. It&#39;s pretty diverse and I would definitely say it&#39;s on an upwards trajectory in terms of the environment. I&#39;ve clocked in at a year and a few months... so far I&#39;ve had no trouble with crime and my neighbors are generally great. Most places I see for rent are 2 and 3 bedrooms in the low $1,000s. We&#39;ve got a decent park and a police station on the west side of the neighborhood. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve got the usual kids&#39; mischief and (what I suspect) is some drug activity, but you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find an area that doesn&#39;t have some mix of violence, drugs, or property crime. It&#39;s a city, after all. </p>

<p>They&#39;re getting ready to start demolition of the old Pemco plant across from Hopkins Bayview and drop in a mixed-use development with a gym, grocery store, two hotels, 500 apartments, and a bunch of other stuff. I&#39;m super pumped to see it all go up (and hopefully the home values along with it).</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, sorry for another &quot;moving to Baltimore post&quot;. I&#39;ve been reading through the old posts and the info in the sidebar and it really helped me with narrowing my search. Ultimately, I&#39;m between 2 places on opposite sides of Pigtown that I really liked and my biggest concern is safety as I&#39;d ideally like to walk to University of Maryland Medical Center, sometimes potentially walking home around 9pm or so, but I&#39;m also wondering about parking.<br/>
&nbsp;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at the 700 block of Carroll St and the 1200 block of Washington Blvd. I&#39;ve heard that closer to MLK tends to be safer and the crime maps (none of which seem to be great) do seem to indicate that area of Washington Blvd having higher crime. I also wasn&#39;t sure how difficult parking on Washington was since it is a major street and if it would be an issue if I had to park on a side street (I went down a couple streets on my trip that I was a little uncomfortable on during the day...but they were less than 2 blocks from absolutely beautiful new construction).<br/>
&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Any opinions, thoughts, or other considerations I might have missed? For reference, I&#39;ve lived in NYC in the past, so I&#39;m not unfamiliar with living in cities. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In previous threads, folks have talked about how awesome and unique Baltimore is when it comes to its many hole-in-the-wall neighborhood corner bars. The majority of these bars don&#39;t show up in any kind of Google maps search, and they vary in the extent to which they&#39;re considered &quot;private&quot; bars. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to visit more of the tucked-away neighborhood corner bars, but I know that some of them cater virtually to only regulars or known neighbors, and I don&#39;t want to seem intrusive as an outsider checking out a bar that is typically more of a private neighborhood club. </p>

<p>Could we get a list going of the names/ locations of some great traditional neighborhood corner bars to check out?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m stopping there. That&#39;s not even close to exhaustive. It is also not representative of anything that occurred subsequent to the November General Election -- i.e.: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-cites-fdr-policies-defend-muslim-ban/story?id=35648128">his own Muslim Ban</a> (his own wording) which he himself compared to to World War II-era internment of Japanese individuals.</p>

<p>Why? Because the question was with regards to anyone who voted for Trump.</p>

<p>Simply stated: they willingly voted for a known sexist and racist. They may not believe themselves to be &quot;sexist&quot; or &quot;racist&quot;, but they were willing to accept someone who is and they cast their vote for him. They continue to apologize for him, and rationalize their actions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is a somewhat new company that I currently use that pretty much does the legwork for you if you are interested.</p>

<p>I was using 3rd party suppliers and was keeping up with it for a while to save money and to get at least a portion of my power from renewable sources (mostly wind) but then I had a kid and stopped keeping track of it. When I looked a few months ago my rate jumped way above BGE and I was about to just say screw it and go with BGE. </p>

<p>That company (that I am not at all affiliated with, I just like the idea. I also can&#39;t guarantee anything as I have only recently started using them a few months back) basically takes control of your account and switches you to different 3rd party suppliers based on the best current deal. </p>

<p>it costs $5/month for their services but so far I have saved much more than that each month so it has made sense for me. </p>

<p>Do you have any recommendations for a day trip from Baltimore and whether you think certain places are worth staying for a few nights. So far, I have found the following and they all look great:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Harrisburg</p></li>
<li><p>Leesburg</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in Delaware</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit: I like a bit of everything, from scenic views, to history, nature, photography locations, good food and places to see</strong></p>

<h2>Is there anyone out there with success/experience in challenging property tax assessments?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(315)">View full post</button><div id="315" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The assessed value of my property increased by 40%. I did some digging into it and it appears that the land value for my property is about $20k higher than all the neighboring properties on my side of the block (and about $60k higher than properties across the street). Per square foot, the improvement value is nearly $50 more than the more recently renovated home next door. I paid above market value for it in 2021, and the new assessed value is identical to the closing price. </p>

<p>In short, I think my new property value is about $30k above what it should be. With Baltimore City property tax rates set to increase, this overvalued assessment will raise my yearly tax payments by about $2k. I plan to appeal the assessment, but am curious if anyone out there has had any experience and/or success in doing so. I&#39;d appreciate any &quot;war stories&quot; from the appeal process as well.</p>

<p>Now, before people chastize me for trying to get out of paying taxes...I understand that across Maryland assessed property values have increased by about 20%. My issue is not with any increase; my issue is that my property is valued significantly more than similarly sized and recently renovated properties on my block. I&#39;d like to pay my fair share, but nothing more than that.</p>
