<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve played this game several dozen times, and any time I&#39;m feeling a little unhappy I play again to pick me up. It is without doubt one of the best games ever made, but it&#39;s also old and full of weird stuff that no one explains. So I thought I&#39;d make this thread to offer some useful information to new players:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The game can be bought <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2600/">here</a> and the (near mandatory) community patch is available <a href="https://www.planetvampire.com/">here</a> which does a lot of fixing and tweaking the game really needs. Other good mods are <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-camarilla-edition">Camarilla edition</a> and <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-clan-quest-mod">clan quest</a></p></li>
<li><p>The sneak skill works on everything in the game except a select few bosses, but supernatural enemies have such high detection it&#39;s very difficult to sneak by them. The obfuscate discipline, which turns you completely invisible, does not work on several very common enemies you&#39;ll encounter and is not very reliable. The very last dungeon(s) do give you a chance to stealth things up though, as only one enemy in either level can see through obfuscate. Specific word of warning: The vampire in the purple coat, with the dreadlocks, who says &quot;Those of you in the front row may get a little wet&quot; (You&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about when you play) - he&#39;s the baseline model for an enemy Toreador. All Toreador vampires you encounter will look like him, and all of them will have access to auspex - a radar discipline that directly counters your stealth and obfuscate. </p></li>
<li><p>As the above implies, you will want some combat ability for when your stealth inevitably fails. Melee or guns, the choice is yours. Melee is better in the early-mid game and guns become better in the late game.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of guns, if you get no other gun get the .44 magnum revolver. It&#39;s accurate, high damage, fast firing, fast reloading, with the only real downside being high ammo costs. Still, a very good personal defense weapon that will see you from the moment you get it to the final boss.</p></li>
<li><p>There are three social skills in the game, persuasion, seduction, and intimidate. Their utility is in the order I just said them. Every character probably wants at least 5 persuasion, as it makes certain quests a lot easier. Seduction lets you feed on women at night clubs in public without anyone caring. It also lets you seduce a female vampire, and get her to send you shitty poetry. Otherwise it&#39;s not that useful. Finally, intimidate is pretty much garbage. </p></li>
<li><p>Your abilities that go above 10 still count. So if you have a 14 in your ranged statistic, you will do more damage than if you just had the (seeming) cap of 10. However, no skill test in the game is higher than ten so for non-combat abilities there is no point to raising them past that point. Yes, I have tested 14 sneak out and no it doesn&#39;t let you sneak through Hallowbrook.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters intent on using guns should invest a few points in the finance skill. Ammunition is expensive, and more importantly a certain someone will give you more cash after every main story mission based on how high your haggle skill is (no not that someone, the other someone). </p></li>
<li><p>Attacks that kill your enemy in one hit, from outside a certain range, don&#39;t cause any surrounding enemies to aggro you. On larger levels, with the sniper rifle, you can pick off an entire map&#39;s worth of enemies without any of them trying to get you.</p></li>
<li><p>Headshots work on some things and not on others. Against zombies, as one example, a headshot with any gun is an instant kill. The aforementioned sniper rifle works best if you go for the head.</p></li>
<li><p>Malkavians are cursed with insanity, and have a lot of very unique content added just for them. Every dialogue response is different, you get to carry out some wacky hijinks, and you will even get cryptic clues from the voices in your head about the game&#39;s plot (which won&#39;t make sense to you until your 2nd playthrough). Playing as a Malkavain, at least once, is mandatory. It&#39;s simply too entertaining to miss.</p></li>
<li><p>Celerity is the most powerful discipline in the game. At high levels of celerity, you will never take a hit as you dodge every incoming bullet or punch like you&#39;re Neo. A gun-focused Toreador is, in my opinion, just as mandatory a playthrough as a Malkavian. It&#39;s much less interesting out of combat, but in combat it&#39;s the most fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Clan Tremere is the 3rd mandatory playthrough. They get a unique haven, some unique dialogue with Strauss, and access to thaumataurgy (the 2nd best discipline in the game). Thaumaturgy is blood magic, and it contains a relatively random grab bag of very useful abilities. Level 1 is blood strike, which does great damage against super natural enemies and is a boss-killer. Level 2 is blood purge, which forces enemies in an AoE around your character to vomit blood. Note the word forces - while they&#39;re vomiting, you&#39;re free to beat them with a stick. It even works on most bosses. Level 3 is blood shield, which renders you much more resistant to damage. In fact, in the late game with blood shield and auspex turned on you are effectively invincible against anything except fire. Level 4 is blood salvo, or blood theft if you&#39;ve got the unofficial patch. It brings your enemy&#39;s blood back to you and fills your blood pool, and depending on what version you&#39;re playing may or may not kill the victim. Tremere can spam their disciplines like no other clan thanks to this ability. Level 5 is blood boil, which does extremely high AoE damage but takes ~5 seconds after casting to detonate (the enemy you cast it on is instantly killed however). Combined with auspex (basically map hacks that buff your defense and guns abilities) and dominate (contains a lot of very powerful crowd control powers) the later half of the game is your playground.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The k button opens up a menu that lets you assign weapons and powers to hotkeys. During my most recent malkavian run, for example, I had 1, 3 and 4 be specific dementation powers, 6 be obfuscate, and 7 be auspex. 2 was a sniper rifle and 5 was the assault rifle.</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re holding a melee weapon, tab makes you block. When you&#39;re holding a weapon with a scope, tab makes you zoom in. When you&#39;re holding a weapon with more than one fire mode, tab changes between them. You want the Uzi on automatic, and the .44 magnum on fan. </p></li>
<li><p>You can change up the type of melee attack you do by selecting a specific direction on WASD. I didn&#39;t find it too useful, but it&#39;s worth keeping in the back of your head.</p></li>
<li><p>The lethality rating of your weapon is - basically - how well it works against enemy supernaturals. The higher the lethality the deadlier it is. The flamethrower&#39;s extreme lethality makes it trivially easy to kill any vampire you come across with it, even bosses. If your skill with a weapon is below its minimum level, you take a feat adjustment that lowers its lethality.</p></li>
<li><p>When your vampire frenzies, their inner beast takes control and they satiate their atavistic impulses. In game terms, you lose control of your character and they charge at the nearest creature intent on either feeding from it or beating it up with their bare hands. For brawl-oriented characters, this isn&#39;t a big deal. For clans that require a bit more finesse in combat, like the Malkavians, it is usually a death sentence. You can lower your chances of frenzy by 1) Avoiding fire - vampires are scared of fire 2) Keeping your blood meter high. Lower blood means less resistance to frenzy and 3) Having a high humanity. You can spend XP to raise your humanity, but it&#39;s not worth it. The better option is to just avoid killing innocents, trying to resolve quests in a peaceful way, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Although a pure stealth character is impossible, a stealthy warrior is completely viable and indeed quite fun. My Malkavian vampires tend to invest rather heavily into the sneak skill, for example, as it allows them to set up a plan of attack before battle begins.</p></li>
<li><p>In Steam, right click on the game and go down to properties. Then click on &#39;set launch options&#39;. Enter &quot;-console&quot; without the quotes. Now when you&#39;re playing the game, the ` key (top left of your keyboard, under the escape usually) will open the console. You can, at any time, type in noclip to fly around and skip levels you don&#39;t like. More importantly, this lets you un-stick yourself when the game&#39;s rather buggy physics get you trapped in an impossible spot. Type in noclip again to return to normal.</p></li>
