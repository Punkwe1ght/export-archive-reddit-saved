<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Build Gameplay</strong></p>

<p>The Knight-Enchanter (KE) specialization enables the mage class to take a very brazen approach to combat. Due to strong synergy between skill trees, the KE is able to focus all of its efforts towards offensive potential, and maintain a strong defense as a result of powerful skills. The one major aspect of gearing and focus that makes this specialization and build stand out is that you can quite literally dump all of your eggs into the Offense basket, and still come out on top due to the nature of how damage mitigation skills are implemented.</p>

<p>This guide is meant to help you progress through the levels and prioritize how you move down the various Mage skill trees, giving you an understanding of why you are making particular skill pickups and how you can expect to utilize them.</p>

<p>Gameplay in general can be broken down into two phases: 1) Moving into melee range, 2) Destroying your enemies. While it is not entirely necessary to be in melee range to kill your enemies, it is more efficient for generating your initial barrier and starting a fight by staggering one or more enemies with Fade Shield and following up with a Fire Mine to max out your barrier bar. The goal of mostly every fight is to generate some initial barrier, use that barrier to power Fire Mine and Immolate via Chaotic Focus, stagger enemies with Fade Shield to ensure they remain in place as the Fire Mine arms and then clean up with Spirit Blade after all the pending damage has resolved. You repeat this process with each group of enemies, utilizing Fade Step to move quickly between groups and Inferno spells to handle single stragglers as you move around the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Specialization Priorities</strong></p>

<p>Before you actually unlock Specializations, you are a basic mage. You don&#39;t have access to the tools you need to play the game like a KE, but you do have access to some of the skills you&#39;ll be using a lot over the course of the game. Starting the game off by going directly down the fire tree towards Fire Mine is generally a good idea. Getting experience with proper placement of Fire Mine and understanding how enemies move and learning to predict their movement is key in the long term to ensuring proper use of the skill.</p>

<p>You might need to pick up Barrier early on, since you have very poor defense and proper use of Flashpoint procs will allow you to keep barriers up nearly all of the time you need them.</p>

<p><strong>Core Skills</strong></p>

<p><em>Inferno: Immolate</em> - Start of Inferno tree for us, one of our most commonly used damage spells. Average damage, long range, good cast time.. good spell to spam, especially on fast moving targets. Pretty low down the priority tree in terms of spells you want to cast, but it serves a purpose.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Flashpoint</em> - Necessary skill to advance the Inferno tree, mostly helpful earlier on to get back-to-back Fire Mines or Barriers.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Pyromancer</em> - Necessary skill to advance the Inferno tree, doesn&#39;t help much in terms of damage output as the enhanced burning duration is generally unnecessary. Panic duration does nothing for us.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Fire Mine</em> - One of, if not the best skill for a KE. Huge damage is used to power Barrier generation, down ranged enemies with ease and in combination with Chaotic Focus, leads to the biggest numbers the build will generate. Takes some practice to get used to when to use it and where to place it, but once you get the hang of the &#39;arming time&#39;, it is invaluable for staggering enemies and dealing huge damage.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Spirit Blade</em> - The most frequently used skill in your repertoire. Deals good damage, hits a fairly wide swath of targets, deals spirit damage (the least resisted of all damage types), has no cooldown and costs very little to cast. This is basically the filler between everything you do, that keeps your barrier maxed out and keeps the damage piling up. When everything else is on cooldown or you are nearly out of mana, this is your go-to spell.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Fade Cloak</em> - Very powerful spell, probably the most powerful you have. Offers invulnerability and invisibility. Enemies will stop trying to attack you and nothing will be able to deal damage to you while it is active. Activating it purges all negative status effects, including being knocked down. If you find yourself in a bad situation, this is what you use. Against enemies who cannot be staggered, this is how you counter their slow, big damage, telegraphed attacks.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Decloaking Blast</em> - Turns an already powerful spell (Fade Cloak) into great CC and damage. Basically, as long as you are very close (phased inside of or right next to) to an enemy when Fade Cloak expires, you deal 1000% weapon damage and juggle them (toss them into the air) into a stagger. (knocked down, unable to react) Combined with Fire Mine, you can chain-stagger an enemy, and between the damage of those two skills, average enemies melt in front of you. They also never have an opportunity to damage you, because you lead into them while invincible, stagger them twice while maxing out your barrier, and giving you 3-4 seconds to spam Spirit Blade, generating even more barrier and potentially some guard.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Combat Clarity</em> - Gives you some of the mana regen you need to spam everything you want. Does not fully fulfill your mana regen needs, and without Rejuvenating Barrier, you will eventually run out and be relegated to only spamming Spirit Blade.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Fade Shield</em> - While not particularly flashy, this is one of the key elements of the build. Dealing damage generates barrier. Simple enough, right? When you can lead into an enemy with no barrier up, drop some quick damage spells to max out your barrier and use Spirit Blade to clean up the mess.</p>

<p><em>Knight-Enchanter: Knight Protector</em> - Good early on, great as you get more powerful. This is what makes your initially meager/slow barrier generation palpable, as it makes your barrier fade significantly slower. Later on, it keeps you maxed out on barrier much more easily, and ensures you have barrier available for chain casting Inferno spells for enhanced damage with Chaotic Focus.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Chaotic Focus</em> - Huge damage booster for Inferno spells. Basically as long as you have any noticeable amount of barrier, every cast of an Inferno spell will take half of your current barrier and double the damage of the spell being cast.  This not only gives you a large boost to damage output, but thanks to Fade Shield, a large boost to barrier generation. This one skill in combination with Fire Mine will absolutely devastate 95% of everything you encounter.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Clean Burn</em> - While a great skill, not hugely relevant until you have all of the pieces to the puzzle. Once you&#39;ve got the barrier generation, Fade Cloak for defense and offensive potential with Inferno spells and Chaotic Focus, you can start to benefit from Clean Burn. And at first, it&#39;s not super good, it just lets you burst a little before running out of mana. Later, after you pick up Rejuvenating Barrier, it becomes the key to putting out lots of damage quickly and reacting defensively with Fade Cloak.</p>

<p><strong>Mid-Late Game Progression</strong></p>

<p>At this point in the build, you will have everything you need to function. Immolate, Fire Mine and Fade Cloak serve as your &quot;burst barrier generation&quot; and main source of damage output in combination with Fade Shield and Chaotic Focus. You have the tools to survive and kill everything. From here on out your aim is to streamline that process by picking up additional skills, passives and upgrades that make everything more potent and re-usable.</p>

<p><em>Spirit: Barrier</em> - Mostly a necessary skill to get further down the tree, used later in the game as a secondary source of barrier for your party when your &quot;primary barrier mage&quot; has his/her skill on cooldown. Most important in Dragon fights, not hugely necessary outside of that.</p>

<p><em>Spirit: Guardian Spirit</em> - This skill serves as an insurance plan in case you neglect your barrier generation, get caught off guard or do something that would typically get you killed.</p>

<p><em>Winter: Fade Step</em> - Your primary mobility tool in and out of combat. This allows you to get into melee range with enemies that sit at a distance, i.e. archers, wraiths, etc. Also very useful throughout the mid and late game for Dragon fights, as it allows you to re-close the distance when they &quot;jump&quot; back away from you. Also helpful when trying to get through doorways and your party members are blocking your way.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Searing Glyph</em> - An upgrade to your biggest damage spell, causing it to do big Damage over Time. Mostly helpful against bigger HP enemies, as the general run of the mill enemy will die immediately to Fire Mine or very soon after. Good for making Fire Mine a fire-and-forget spell on easier ranged targets later in the game.</p>

<p><em>Inferno: Wildfire</em> - Along the same lines as Searing Glyph, but makes Immolate more potent and allows it to scale easier in the end game. More initial damage on a very frequently used spell and allows it to be used even more often.</p>

<p><em>Spirit: Peaceful Aura</em> - Necessary skill to advance the Spirit tree, doesn&#39;t do much for us since we are generating a lot of aggro with Inferno spells and can tank any aggro we do get. If anything this is a mild negative for us, since we actually want targets to focus on us en masse to make it easier to drop Fire Mines on more enemies at once.</p>

<p><em>Spirit: Dispel</em> - Necessary skill to advance the Spirit tree. Useful mainly for insta-killing enemies that are spawning from a rift, otherwise not necessary as Spirit Blade can easily destroy enemy barriers with its 200% bonus damage against barriers. Of the unnecessary active skills you acquire, you have room for 1 of them on your hotbar. This is the one I use.</p>

<p><em>Spirit: Rejuvenating Barrier</em> - The skill that turns you from an early/mid game Spirt Blade spammer to a later game Inferno spammer. This skill, in combination with Combat Clarity gives you so much mana regen that you will actually find it difficult to remain out of mana. This enables you to drop a lot of Inferno spells and make very frequent use of Fade Cloak to constantly juggle-stagger groups of enemies.</p>

<p><em>Storm: Energy Barrage</em> - Necessary skill to advance the Storm tree. Does a decent job of working up a bit of Guard, (because it hits 12 times) but not really something you want to be using your mana on. Casts with little to no animation, so you can use it as you are charging into melee. Not really a good skill, but not the worst to have as your single unnecessary skill on the hotbar.</p>

<p><em>Storm: Conductive Current</em> - Great passive skill when you are using everything as much as you can. Frequent use of Inferno spells and Fade Cloak intermixed with Spirit Blade spam will keep you at very low mana. If you can hover between 20-30% mana available most of the time, that&#39;s a 35-40% damage boost on everything you do.</p>

<p><em>Storm: Static Charge</em> - Actually really powerful passive against annoying enemies that stagger you frequently, like every guy who has a shield. Stuns them when they go to hit you, and allows you to wail on them and not have to worry about being knocked down. Since you are more or less always casting something, you will generally always get some kind of protection from this against melee enemies. Between this and juggle-staggering enemies with Fire Mine and Fade Cloak, you won&#39;t actually get successfully attacked in melee very often at all.</p>

<p><strong>Gearing</strong></p>

<p>You have two basic goals in gearing: 1) Generate Guard and 2) Improve damage output.</p>

<p>The first can be accomplished by crafting a weapon or piece of armor with Fade-Touched Obsidian and Fade-Touched Silverite. While both of these are rare versions of their normal variant, if you don&#39;t have the luxury of farming for them, there are some static spawns of Fade-Touched Obsidian. The two spawns I am aware of are in the Hinterlands. The first is in a locked house in Redcliffe Village that requires the &quot;Deft Hands, Fine Tools&quot; perk. The second is in a lootable container on a boat docked in the area northeast of where the Hinterlands Dragon (Ferelden Frostback) spawns. Even if you can&#39;t kill him, odds are you can sacrifice your party long enough to run past him, loot the Obsidian and run back out of his area, enabling you to Quick Travel away.</p>

<p>The second is a bit more complicated and requires you to craft gear as you go. Basically speaking, you want the highest base damage weapon you can find and you want to craft at least your weapon or your armor, in order to attain the Guard on Hit mastercraft proc. For the mid-game, the armor I used the Warden Battlemage Armor, which you can get the schematicfrom the Dalish vendor in Exalted Plains around level 10-12. You can ride that armor into the late game until you kill the dragons necessary to craft your final armor, thanks to the many layers of defense available to you as a KE.</p>

<p>In the end, you&#39;re going to want a mix of critical chance, critical damage, magic, willpower and attack. When trying to decide whether one piece of gear is better than another based on available crafting slots, always value Offense slots higher than anything else, as it allows you to put &quot;pure&quot; Attack, Critical Chance and Critical Damage directly on your items. After Offense, Cloth Utility is best, as Willpower and Magic are your next go-to stats. After that, Leather Utility is best, as Cunning and Dexterity contribute to Critical Chance and Damage respectively.</p>

<p>In terms of schematics used for crafting, you can buy what are generally the second best schematics, but not the best. The best schematics need to be found. There are a variety of ways to do this.. ranging from farming random enemies in high level areas, &quot;abusing&quot; the loot spawn system or simply hoping that RNG will reward you with schematics you need. Regardless of how you go about it, here is a list of high end schematics and items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Superior Battlemage Coat (Masterwork, found)</li>
<li>Sturdy Battlemage Armor (Canyon vendor, Hissing Wastes)</li>
<li>Battlemage Armor Legs (Canyon vendor, Hissing Wastes)</li>
<li>Battlemage Armor Arms (Canyon vendor, Hissing Wastes)</li>
<li>Superior Seer Cowl (Masterwork, found)</li>
<li>Seer Cowl (found)</li>
<li>Seer Staff (found)</li>
<li>First Enchanter Staff (Keep vendor, Emprise Du Lion)</li>

<li>Inscribed Staff Grip (Keep vendor, Emprise Du Lion)</li>
<li>Dragon Staff Blade (found)</li>
<li>Witch Staff Blade (found)</li>

</ul>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>1) There have been a couple Bioware approved books based on Dragon Age <em>canon</em>, and their plots are referenced in-game many times by many people, up to and including the entire background story and quests of one of your companions.</p>

<p>2) There is free stuff you can get via various internet promotions. </p>

<p>3) (EDIT  - Correction, there are around 25) Crafting <strong>some</strong> &quot;Armor&quot; leaves no slots for legs or arms; you might want to test a schematic with junk mats first or look it up on a wiki before using valuable materials.</p>

<p>4) Doing all the side quests yields way more &quot;power&quot; points for the war table then you&#39;ll ever need to do the main campaign. So doing requisition quests is largely (with a few exceptions) just a waste of resources. They&#39;re only good for pushing through the campaign faster IMHO. You will be able to farm for the influence points for valuable perks later on easier.</p>

<p>5) Nice rare items can be disassembled for parts that can be used on even nicer crafted items.Runes are permanent, but can easily be crafted again. Masterwork items are common, use them.(Edit, for SP, I mean legs, arms, grips, hafts, pommels - salvaging is in multiplayer)</p>

<p>6) For warriors, Heal on damage taken + bonus to heal items + Guard on hit is as good as a base resist and means never needing to use a potion.</p>

<p>7) + Willpower is the best secondary stat for all classes</p>

<p>8) Certain companions can&#39;t be romanced by certain genders and races.</p>

<p>9) Some valuables you need to save. </p>

<p>10) There are a lot of codex entries that you have to actually go into the codex to find out about - they don&#39;t pop up on screen. As well, the conversation /xp unlock perks also add a great deal of info. </p>

<p>edit: most every question you might have about these points, and more - has been covered in the comments :D</p>

<h2>Complete(*) List of Unique Weapons and Armor with Stats and How To Get Them [Spoilers]</h2>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/2q51tv/complete_list_of_unique_weapons_and_armor_with/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('2q51tv')">View full post</button>
<div id="2q51tv" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to post a real list of unique items for Dragon Age Inquisition; unique weapons, unique armor and other items like unique belts, unique rings, recipes, etc.  By real, I mean one that I&#39;ve confirmed over three playthroughs and one that has item stats, item locations, quests and vendors they are tied to.  This is NOT information that was copied from random vague and often horribly incorrect postings on other sites this is all stuff I have found in game.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KXeXBXDiSKW1HmxJ6T9YmWl0BURkjgJPCYO8X0Q5Tc/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>Here is the list.</strong></a><br/>
<em>(I find Internet Explorer to be a bit wonky with Google Docs, so if you&#39;re just getting a grey screen on the tabs, try Chrome or just a wait a bit it should load.)</em></p>

<p>The list of items is as complete as I could get it. If I find others I will add them as I am able to confirm their stats and how you acquire them. It&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that there are quest paths in the game that I&#39;ve not followed and as such there may be items that I don&#39;t have on this list.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for help keeping this up-to-date as well as filling in the gaps.  If you have an item that got missed I would appreciate repeatable steps on how you got the item.  If I can successfully get the item myself I&#39;ll add it to the list with the steps you&#39;ve provided on obtaining it.  &quot;I found this item, here are the stats, I don&#39;t know where or how I got it&quot; isn&#39;t going to get it on the list.</p>

<p>Although I have tried to added notes where appropriate, this is not a how-to quest guide, as such there are not going to be detailed descriptions of how to obtain and complete every quest that is referenced.  That&#39;s what Google and YouTube are for. ;)</p>

<p><strong>Some Caveats About This List</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Please note that the values listed in the Armor, DPS and Damage columns can vary when the item is &quot;dropped/looted&quot; there seems to be a range of values that the game selects from for them.
What I have listed is simply from the values that were geneated for me.  I have gotten multiple items through different playthrough and compared them and the variation is minor.
If I felt the variation was so much that it invalidated the data, I would not have included it.</p></li>
<li><p>Please note that this list does not contain &quot;Special Shipment&quot; / DLC items that a given player may or may not have access to based on the version of the game they purchased.<br/>
In the future, if real DLC drops and new items get added to the game, I will include them.</p></li>
<li><p>Please note that no prices are given for the vendor related items.  This is intentional as various Inquisition perks will cause these values to vary on a per player basis.
As such, I did not find that it would be reliable to put in numbers that could be vary quite a bit from person to person.</p></li>
<li><p>No masterwork armor or weapon schematics are listed.  I was not actively tracking these drops and as such did not have enough information on hand to determine which were guaranteed drops
and which were random chance.  I felt the potential random nature of this would cause listing them and the locations I found them at to be misleading.</p></li>

<h2>[Spoilers] I made a map of the Winter Palace</h2>

<p>I made this map to help myself in getting everything in the palace. But alas, in the end i had to leave behind Vivienne&#39;s amulet of power. Thought you guys might also find it useful.</p>

<p>There are two locked doors that can only be opened by a rogue. One in the library and the other in the trophy room. I couldn&#39;t open them myself but i assume they only contain some generic loot.</p>

<p>Some of the coins, scandalous materials and eavesdrop opportunities only become accessible after the dance with the grand duchess.</p>

<p>The map of the servants&#39; quarters and grand apartments is somehow fucked up ingame, as if a work in progress that the developers forgot to finish, which is why it also looks a bit weird here.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright, Skyhold is a beautiful fortress, but it is also massive. I&#39;m the type of player who likes to talk to every companion/adviser after every quest. It becomes a a pain in a butt zipping around Skyhold.   </p>

<p>My usual &quot;route&quot;:<br/>
1. Fast travel to Leliana; talk to Leliana<br/>
2. Walk down flight of stairs. Turn in artifacts (gotta get that xp), and talk to Dorian.<br/>
3. Ignore stairs. Jump straight down (break my legs) to Solas&#39; room. Talk to Solas. Walk outside and talk to Cullen.<br/>
4. Fast travel to stable. Talk to Blackwall. Sell junk. Maybe buy a horse or two.<br/>
5. Fast travel beside Cassandra. Talk to Cassandra. Go into the tavern. Talk to Iron Bull, Sera and Cole. 9/10 times Cole doesn&#39;t show up, so I gotta F5 and F9. Don&#39;t forget to grab 1/infinite amulets of power.<br/>
6. Fast travel to throne. Talk to Varric. Talk to Josephine. Call a war table meeting.<br/>
7. Fast travel to throne again. Judge prisoners. Go to undercroft and craft something.   </p>

<p>I usually forget about Vivienne because she stands in the most inconvenient spot.  </p>

<p>PS: My route is ruined whenever a cut scene teleports me to some odd place in Skyhold.</p>

<h2>[Important PSA] You will get SO MUCH MORE out of the game, out of ANY of the games, if you take some time to read some key codex entries.</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had a day off today and I was sick so I spent very literally my entire day reading about the history of Thedas. Where the races of Men came from, from how the Tevinter rose to power and how the elves, once a continent spanning empire, became by and large a slave race. </p>

<p>I read about the Blights, all five of them, and found that there was still potential for there to be two more. I would even say there -has- to be two more. I read about each and every Old God turned Archdemon, over the controversy about the Golden City going black and the founding of the Darkspawn due to the hubris of 
the Tevinter.</p>

<p>Anyways, I read a whole lot of Dragon Age lore... and the game seems a million times more real to  me. Having the idea in the back of my head that the Magisters who opened the gate into the Golden City would be akin to the Pope and his Cardinals finding a secret way in to Heaven, God&#39;s kingdom, and upon getting there finding it blackened and corrupted. Blighted, and very much without the presence of their God... it&#39;s a powerful idea.</p>

<p>TLDR - Take some time to read up on Dragon Age lore on <a href="http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Age_Wiki">http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Age_Wiki</a>
It will, without a doubt, make your experience a better and more in-depth one.</p>

<h2>What "well crap..I wish I'd known that" knowledge can you pass on for Dragon Age Inquisition players?</h2>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize a lot of things my first play-through, so I&#39;m sure there are countless other things I didn&#39;t know about or overlooked. It can be tips, exploits, things easy to miss, easter eggs, etc.</p>

<p><strong><em>SPOILERS</em></strong></p>

<p>ADDED BY REDDIT</p>

<p>----------- GENERAL TIPS -----------</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Casting Barrier will negate any fall damage. Same thing applies to falling while mounted. Will do wonders for places like the Forbidden Oasis.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to jump up something? Check to see if your companions have run ahead of you a bit to a steadier location. You can switch control to them and run to them. Makes getting up certain mountains WAY easier.
--I also used this trick for the Fallow Mire to &quot;sneak&quot; into water to loot without disturbing it.</p></li>
<li><p>The only valuables you need to hold on to (that I know of so far) are Spider parts (for a requisition) and &quot;Sad Splinters&quot; to make the &quot;Sad Weapon&quot; easter egg - you get the splinters from breaking the door of a keep.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re seriously into the &quot;I want to know all the lore&quot;, Solas, and Cole are the ones you tend to want with you. Cole fills out alot of personal information, even on just random quest giver 200057, and Solas provides super important commentary on all the Elvish ruins you run across.</p></li>
<li><p>Crafted items were always WAY better for me than most things I could buy or find. (Most true at low-mid levels)</p></li>
<li><p>Some agents are only recruitable if you have the right companion in your party at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>On PC, &quot;G&quot; is Auto run. This makes life much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t take falling damage while mounted.</p>

<p>-----------GAMEPLAY / COMBAT TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>Each party member has their own focus pool. There isn&#39;t just one shared by all.</p></li>
<li><p>Party members have their focus ability off by default. I rarely control my allies and never noticed they weren&#39;t triggering their special ability until like 65 hours in.</p></li>
<li><p>You can turn abilities on and off for your team and pick favorite moves for them to use as much as possible. Check out the &quot;behaviors&quot; section. Some were defaulted to &quot;off&quot; for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Dagger rogues will always try to die unless you give them the abilities required to constantly be in stealth.</p></li>
<li><p>You can tell companions to hold position in the tac cam setting by double clicking where you want them to hold position.</p>

<p>----------- CRAFTER TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>When harvesting a group of herbs or minerals, switch characters while the first character starts the collecting animation. Get everyone harvestin at the same time!</p></li>
<li><p>Good crafting materials -- Dales loden wool, plush fustian velvet, silverite, everite, etc. -- will be found at much lower levels if you do Emprise du Lion below level 16. You&#39;ll get one unit of silverite per deposit, for example, or one or two units of cloth per downed enemy, if your character is less than that. Hit level 16, and boom -- plush fustian velvet x8, everite x7.
So don&#39;t make the mistake I did of cleaning out the place before level 16! The metals will re-spawn, but the cloth will not.</p></li>
<li><p>When doing Mastercraft, the % chance to get &quot;10% bonus to all stats&quot;- NOTE that that 10% boost is not +10% (making a 10% chance of something become 20%),it&#39;s actually just adding 10% of whatever you currently have (so 10% becomes 11%)</p>

<p>----------- RIFT TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t need to close all the rifts. However, you do get an operation if you close at least 3/4 of them.</p></li>
<li><p>You can switch characters while your inquisitor is closing a rift, allowing you to start picking up whatever the enemies dropped. Also it&#39;s kind of cool watching your Inquisitor close rifts from another perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re taking on a rift, using dispel on demon spawn locations prevents them from spawning. You can also use Immolate (mage?) and Spell Purge (Templar).</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-spawn areas can also be hacked with weapons, and monsters won&#39;t appear from them, too.</p></li>
<li><p>When demons are re-spawning at a rift, the size and brightness of the spawn site tell you which spots will spawn the most powerful demons. Brighter=More Powerful</p></li>
<li><p>If Dorian or your mage casts Spirit Mark, you don&#39;t have to wait for the enemies to die. If you click the spell again, everything that&#39;s been reanimated will collapse. (This is probably obvious if you&#39;re a necromancer yourself, but I had Dorian doing it autonomously and it was really irritating waiting for demons to die so I could close rifts until I figured it out.)</p>

<p>----------- SKYHOLD TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>The Garden Upgrade to get Tithes (gold) is bugged- apparently they forgot to implement a way to actually get the gold, so this option is a waste of your time.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a door in the room with Solas that will run across the battlements to Cullen. Saves a lot of running and jumping.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no fall damage in Skyhold, so there are plenty of Batman shortcuts you can take from location to location.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending someone to the gibbet is to send them to the noose. Like hanging them. Until dead.</p></li>
<li><p>To get throne accessories, gather resource missions in the corresponding area. For example gather resources in Crestwood to get the chaisent(sp) accessories. Do the &quot;Gather Coin&quot; mission to get the Inquisition throne ones.</p>

<p>----------- QUEST TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;Mercy&#39;s Crest&quot; Requistion item is something you should wear during the &quot;Cleaning House&quot; quest in Storm Coast - it gets you all the Hessarians as agents, 3 additional power points, 300+ influence, and the Hessarians are no longer hostile.</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re at the Grand Ball for the main story quest, you can toss those coins into the fountain for a time boost</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re vising imprisoned Blackwall in Val Royeaux, there&#39;s a chest somewhere inside the prison hall that has an amulet bestowing one skill point unto him when equipped. If you loot it, exit to Val Royeaux, and come back, it will still be there. Repeat forever.</p>

<p>----------- EASTER EGGS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a giant cheese wedge shield called &quot;The Wedge of Destiny&quot; in Crestwood by the &quot;Three Trout Farm&quot; Camp.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a &quot;sad weapon&quot; that&#39;s a banana nailed to a stick (be sure to keep the &quot;sad splinters&quot; when you break the door to a keep)</p>

<p>----------- MERCHANT TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>Emprise du Lion have a merchant in the Suledin Keep who sells one of the best weapons</p></li>
<li><p>In Val Royeaux, if you go to where the furniture merchant&#39;s place is, then go up the stairs (there should be a garden in front of you, a lover&#39;s alcove to the right) there&#39;s a door in the far corner that leads to a merchant that sells a bunch of schematics. Later, another merchant sets up shop there and he sells codices and schematics located in areas that you no longer have access to.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s a merchant on the far left of the Hissing Wastes that sells some of the best in-game gear (once you unlock the Tier 3 merchant items with the Inquisition Perk)</p></li>
<li><p>Some merchants sell crafting materials. For Ex., the Crossroads merchant sells Elfroot, Splindweed, Blood Lotus, leathers, etc.</p>

<p>----------- WAR TABLE TIPS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>Inquisition has only 20 levels meaning you can&#39;t get all the perks. So choose wisely.</p></li>
<li><p>True Grit is still bugged as far as i know. It only grants the Inquisitor the 10% resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>The agents count towards getting perks.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the war table texts on each card option- time isnt the only difference between the three advisors. Each will do something different.</p></li>
<li><p>For Resource Missions - check the cards- each person will look for a different material.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re on PC, you can adjust your computer&#39;s clock to complete those long war table missions...which randomly jump from like 1 hour to 20+ hours.</p>

<p>----------- EXPLOITS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>You can buy all of the Skyhold fixtures for &quot;free&quot; from the furniture merchant via an exploit (you can&#39;t preview them before buying, so I took advantage of this)-- just buy them all and before closing the window, sell them all back.  (you can also do this with the mounts and the book merchant in Skyhold)</p></li>
<li><p>With Farris the Representative, you can buy his rep and then sell it right back. Potentially unlimited power and influence.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a duplicating exploit. Works with every crafting material except with herbs. You need at least two of the material you want to duplicate.
Mark them for sale so they are moved into Valuables. Make sure you have only the material in your Valuables.
Go to any vendor, prepare to sell all Valuables. Hit Sell all FIRST but in VERY SHORT succession hit the sell button (on PC click Sell all and hit space/enter). You know you did it right when you get the window how many you want to sell but the item isn&#39;t in the valuables list anymore. Just press sell then. Then go to re-buy/buy back and there will be double the amount. Don&#39;t worry, you will always get the appropriate amount of money so you can always re-buy/resell.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re on pc you can just adjust your computer&#39;s clock to complete those long war table missions...which randomly jump from like 1 hour to 20+ hours.</p>

<p>----------- CHEST/LOOT EXPLOITS -----------</p></li>
<li><p>Chests are reusable. If you leave one item in them, they will be filled again after coming back to the location. Some have random loot (high level areas can spawn tier 3 schematics), some have locked loot (can be exploited for unlimited amulets of power).</p></li>
<li><p>If you ever enter the Silent Ruins in the Western Approach, leave all chests with at least one item in them. The Silent Ruins are one of the few places that Tier 3 schematics spawn, and you can farm that shit if you leave your chests with AT LEAST ONE ITEM inside. Leave the Ruins and return for new items in every chest.</p></li>
<li><p>Early game there is one chest in Valammar that gives T3 schematics. Once you take something out (of course, leaving at least one item so it doesn&#39;t finish the chest), you do have to run out and back in, but you can get T3 schematics before Skyhold that way.</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re vising imprisoned Blackwall in Val Royeaux, there&#39;s a chest somewhere inside the prison hall that has an amulet bestowing one skill point unto him when equipped. If you loot it, exit to Val Royeaux, and come back, it will still be there. Repeat forever.</p></li>
