<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there,</p>

<p>I am a player that has played League of Legends for quite some time and I am use to the basic structure of having a caster going in the middle lane, generally a tank/bruiser in the top lane, a jungler (roamer) and then the ranger carry and support in the bottom lane. With Heroes of the Storm I am unsure of what the roles that need to be filled are, or what the meta is at this point of time.</p>

<p>SO I was just wondering if someone could explain to me what the average roles and positions that are filled each game and what they entail (which heroes play this role and what is expected of them). That is if there is a structure to what people pick or do people just pick what they want and go where they want?</p>

<p>Thanks :<sup>)</sup></p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the responses! There is a lot to take in, but hopefully I will get there.</p>
