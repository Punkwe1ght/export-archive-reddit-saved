<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As there doesn&#39;t seem to be any recent tip and tricks thread regarding this wonderful game, I thought it could be a good idea to start one, so that veterans could give some useful insights to new players. This is not intended to be a full guide, and in order to keep this thread spoiler free, the darkest dungeon itself should not be discussed here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with a collection of what I can think of, feel free to add anything deemed useful and/or correct me if needed! Be warned, that&#39;s quite a read!</p>

<p><strong>Generalities and Hamlet management</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Unless you are playing in NG+, you cannot lose the game. Sure your heroes can die, a specific town even can destroy some of your upgrades, but whatever happens, you can always recover. To continue on this:</li>
<li>Your hamlet is the only thing that really matters. Your heroes may die, but your hamlet and its upgrades remain, and that&#39;s the important part.</li>
<li>When starting a new game, upgrade the stage coach first. You want to have at least 4 heroes available as soon as possible. This gives you fresh meat for the grinder and ensures that you will always have heroes available to delve into the dungeons.</li>
<li>The most important buildings are the Guild and the Blacksmith. Once you have 4 heroes available in the Stagecoach, Guild and Blacksmith are your absolute priority. Upgrading your heroes will be your main goal, and also your major gold sink. Make sure to also upgrade the cost reduction of these buildings, this will save you a lot of money in the long run.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t hesitate to ditch heroes that are too muched stressed or have too many negative quirks. It is much more cost effective to hire a new hero rather that trying to fix the ones that are badly flawed.</li>
<li>If you ever feel like you&#39;re stuck in and endless cycle with no money and fully stressed heroes, send new ones from the stagecoach with only the strict minimum provisions (some food, maybe some torches, and nothing else). Gather as much as you can from a dungeon then retreat when things go south. Ditch those poor souls that are no use to you anymore, and voil√†, you&#39;ve got some money to keep going. This is of course a last resort strat, but it is effective to get back on your feet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dungeons generalities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More light = enemies do less damage, you take less stress damage, you get increased chances of scouting and less chances of being surprised.</li>
<li>Less light = enemies do more damage and have higher crit chance, you take more stress damage, you get higher crit chance and you get more loot.</li>
<li>No light = the above + chance of being attacked by a Shambler, one of the most difficult bosses in the game. If you manage to kill it, you may also get one of the most valuable trinkets in the game: the ancestor&#39;s map.</li>
<li>About scouting: scouting is love, scouting is life. Scouting allows you to know where to go, and where there is no need to go, it prevents from being surprised and it allows you to disarm traps. This is one of the most important mechanics in dungeons.</li>
<li>In fights, focus the 3rd and 4th row first. This is usually where the stress damage dealers are, and the sooner they die, the less stress you&#39;ll take. Additionnaly, the enemy frontline is usually unable to hit your 3rd and 4th row. Killing the backline first will also protect your squishy heroes in the back.</li>
<li>Beware, as you progress into the game, you may think that you get a grasp on things as you&#39;ll be cleaning apprentice and maybe veteran dungeons easily. There is a MASSIVE gap in difficulty between veteran and champion dungeon. Up until veteran dungeon, damage is king and you can usually oneshot every enemy. If you think you can get along just fine by using the same strat in champion dungeons, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time. This brings me to my next point:</li>
<li>Don&#39;t underestimate stuns. A stunned enemy is an enemy that doesn&#39;t do any damage this turn. This may seem useless when you oneshot everthing, but believe me, stuns are the best abilities in the game. In addition to giving you more time to deal with pesky enemies, it also allows you to stall the fight to get some much needed healing or stress relief. Once you try it, you can never go back from it.</li>
<li>In the same line of thinking, don&#39;t use heals on the first and second turns (unless really needed). Using a stun or a damaging ability instead should allow you kill/disable one more enemy in the early turns, which, when you think about it, is the same as healing: that&#39;s damage you won&#39;t take. Only use your heals when there are 1-2 enemies remaining and the rest of your team can disable them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stats and trinkets</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Accuracy: it may seem useless on lower difficulty dungeons, but it is mandatory on damage dealers in champion dungeons. The Sun Ring (and its counterpart the moon ring for dark runs) is probably the best accuracy trinket. I strongly advise equipping your damage dealers with this.</li>
<li>Speed: Speed determines who goes first on each round. Quoting the wiki: During each turn, each unit is assigned a random number ranging from 1 to 8, to which its SPD value is added; the order that the participants to the battle will follow to take their actions will be determined by these values, with the highest acting first. Speed is - to me - by far the most important stat. Going first allows you to deal with enemies before they even act, giving you a massive headstart in each fight. You need speed. Some speed trinkets I&#39;d consider for speed, in no particular order: Berserk charm, Feather charm, Lock of fury, Quickdraw charm, Crescendo Box, Ancestor&#39;s Candle.</li>
<li>Critical chance: In addition to giving you massive damage, a crit gives stress relief to the hero that dealt it, and sometimes to his/here allies as well. It&#39;s all around a good stat, but way too RNG based (to me) to build a team just on that.</li>
<li>Dodge: for characters that have a high based dodge, I&#39;d definitely consider giving them a dodge trinket when a defensive stat is needed. Ancestor&#39;s cloak, Camouflage cloak and Feather charm are some good dodge trinkets I&#39;d use.</li>
<li>Prot: reduces the damage taken by the amount of prot you have. I&#39;ve never used a prot trinket on anyone as I feel there are some much more useful stats to improve, but why not? I have actually never tested it so I wouldn&#39;t know.</li>
<li>Bonus Damage: this is the be-all end-all stat in lower difficulty dungeons, but it falls down significantly in champion dungeon. Not that it&#39;s bad, but you&#39;ll usually need two attacks to kill any enemy, trinket or not, so it&#39;s ill-advised to give a hero two damage trinkets.</li>
<li>Status effect chance: wether it is stun, bleed, blight or debuff, you will need them in champion dungeons because of the higher resistance of enemies. I won&#39;t go into a detailed list of trinkets here, but know that these trinkets are important in champion difficulty.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>classes</strong></p>

<p>This could need a dedicated thread, and I&#39;m pretty sure there are some guides out there already. I&#39;ll just throw some stuff here that seems relevant to me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Abomination : Fantastic self healing and stress healing abilities, very decent speed. I mainly use the abomination for his stun: given his speed, this usually allows me to stun an enemy before it acts on the first turn, and that&#39;s a huge benefit. He is a beast when transformed (pun intended), but I&#39;d rather let someone else do the damage dealing stuff and keep stunning with him. With his legendary trinket, the cost of his transformation is negligible so don&#39;t hesitate to transform when you feel it&#39;s needed. If you wanna go Shambler hunting, you can consider taking an abomination with you: his Rake allows you to destroy the tentacles quite efficiently.</li>
<li>Antiquarian : When you need gold, bring an antiquarian. This is a sub-par hero regarding skills, but she will raise the gold stack limit by 500 (per antiquarian in the team), in addition to giving you bonus stuff each time you get loot with her. Her skillset scales quite nicely, and she performs somewhat decently at higher levels. Her most useful skills are (to me) Invigorating vapors and Protect Me! She goes quite well with a ripost team (namely Man at Arms and Highwayman), but this usually leads to high stress.</li>
<li>Arbalest : You won&#39;t need an accuracy trinket with her, her Sniper Shot already has a very decent accuracy. She performs very well in a marking party and crits very often. Don&#39;t underestimate her blindshot that gives her the speed bonus she really needs. Rallying flare is also a fantastic ability in the weald, or your know, against the Swine King. Her healing ability is also very nice, not so much for the heal itself but rather for the healing buff that it gives, allowing you to quicky top up someone that badly needs heal. Berserk Charm is a very nice trinket for the arbalest, given her high base accuracy. She is however very position dependant, so build your party accordingly.</li>
<li>Bounty Hunter : An extremely solid damage dealer, a very high base stun chance, a shuffle, what&#39;s not to like? The bounty hunter is your go-to support/damage dealer. He&#39;s pretty straightforward so there&#39;s not much else I can think of about him</li>
<li>Crusader : A freaking tank on steroids, especially in the ruins. I don&#39;t use his stun much because of its low base chance, but the rest of his skillset is fantastic. I usually use it on 3rd rank to start the fight with holy lance, that damage and crit chance is super good. He also has a very potent stress relief ability, some healing in case of emergency, a decent AoE. Yeah, I really like the Crusader. He&#39;s slow as fuck however.</li>
<li>Grave Robber : She&#39;s squishy as hell, but damn she&#39;s good at dealing damage. She can attack any row, from almost everywhere, she has a very high base dodge stat and her Lunge ability is freaking awesome. If you want raw damage, bring a Grave Robber. She particularly shines in a dancing party. If you have enough guys to bring her in the back between rounds, you can chain lunge and literally wreck everything. Plus, she&#39;s got the speed man. Like, all of it.</li>
<li>Hellion : Probably (to me) the most overpowered hero in your barracks. Mainly because of Barbaric Yawp and Iron Swan. Iron swan lets you kill the 4th rank, and I believe she is the only one that can hit that rank from the 1st row. This alone make her awesome. And then come Barbaric Yawp. It has a very high base stun chance. Add in a stun trinket and you&#39;ll lock the enrmy frontline for days. With a Hellion in your team, there is no way things can go wrong. Take care of the backline, then yawp and yawp again while the rest of your team uses heals and stress relief, and you&#39;ll finish your dungeon with full health and no stress easily.</li>
<li>Highwayman : I must admit that I don&#39;t really like the highwayman. Not that he&#39;s bad. On low level dungeons he&#39;s a monster. But I feel like his damage falls off in champion dungeons, and he doesn&#39;t have anything else to bring to the table. No stun, no buff, no nothing. He is pure damage. Even the Grave Robber has more utility. I&#39;ll concede however that he&#39;s very good in the damage part. Open with Duelist&#39;s advance to activate riposte, then go Wicked slice or Point blank shot for massive damage and you&#39;ll be good to go. I don&#39;t find much use in the ranged abilities he has, but with the right trinkets this could work as well. I&#39;ve never tested it so I wouldn&#39;t know.</li>
<li>Houndmaster : A fantastic stun and stress relief ability, a decent self-heal, his Hound&#39;s rush can hit any rank, his Target whistle reduces enemy&#39;s prot and he has very decent speed. Again, what&#39;s not to like? He is a fantastic support/damage dealer all around.</li>
<li>Jester : If you haven&#39;t tried Finale recently (well, since the patch that buffed it), you should try it. The Jester has a very decent speed that will allow him to use his Finale to get in the back before he gets hit by the frontline, and the damage of this ability is insane. In apprentice or veteran dungeon, you will basically oneshot anyone with this skill. After the first turn, you can use him as a support, and he&#39;s damn good at it. His stress relief ability is very good, Battle ballad is awesome for the speed and accuracy bonus it gives (crit is nice also, but, you know, speed and accuracy). He performs very well in a dancing party, or with a Leper to compensate his low accuracy.</li>
<li>Leper : Leper is love, Leper is life. Extremely position dependant (he can&#39;t do anything in 3rd or 4th row), the Leper is a beast in the frontline. He has very high health, the highest base damage of all characters, and a very good skillset: in addition to the usual damage dealing abilities, he can heal or stress heal himself, reduce the enemy&#39;s damage, self buff his damage and accuracy, yeah he&#39;s good. However, he needs a proper party that will support him. His very low accuracy will be your doom if you can&#39;t mitigate it one way or another. But in the right party, he&#39;ll juste destroy anything in his path. He&#39;s also freaking slow. This is also a character that I would consider for shambler hunting, filling the same role as the abomination.</li>
<li>Man-at-arm : It took me a while to get a grasp on the man at arm, but now that I do, I almost always want one in my party. He&#39;s beefy as hell, his stun ability is very good with the right trinkets, his guard makes him even beefier and allows you to protect any low-life ally, and his Bolster and Command are very good. I mainly use him as a stunner, but when there is no need for a stun, I&#39;ll be very happy to throw a Bolster for the speed and dodge bonus, or a Command to let my Leper hit his target. There are also some specific fights where his guard ability with trivialize the fight, so consider that also.</li>
<li>Occultist : A decent healer, even if he&#39;s quite frustrating sometimes, and definitely a fantastic support. He&#39;s fasst, his damaging abilities are much more powerful than the vestal&#39;s, he can mark, he can reduce the enemy&#39;s damage, he&#39;s good. I use him way more often than I use the Vestal. However, don&#39;t bring him with low bleed resist characters, otherwise it will end badly. I learned my lesson once, Leper and Occultists don&#39;t match. But seriously though, you may have been fucked up by the occultist once and decided to never use him ever again since, but give it a try. Just, take profit of his damaging abilities in the firsts rounds of fights, and you&#39;ll see his potential. He especially shines against eldritch enemies, namely the weald and the cove.</li>
<li>Plague Doctor : She has very good stuns, she can cure bleed and blight, very potent blights and high speed, she&#39;s good. Equip her with her legendary trinket and you&#39;ll have an extremely potent stunner that can lock down the backrow for 2 turns in a row quite easily. However, I&#39;ve quickly replaced her Blinding gas by Disorienting blast, mainly because I take care of the back row first anyway, so I&#39;d rather have a stun that can also target the 2nd rank when needed. Her blights are quite effective, but more often than not I&#39;d rather stun enemies than blight them. She particularly shines in the cove with her bleed cure.</li>
<li>Vestal : Your basic healer, she&#39;s very good at it. I feel however that she doesn&#39;t have much else she can do than healing. Sure, Judgement allows you to finish an enemy and heal yourself in the process, but I generally feel like she&#39;s really lacking in the offense department. Fo a change of pace and playstyle, you should try rank 2 vestal with a Profane Scroll. This doesn&#39;t work with every party, but with the right setup that&#39;s damn powerful. This allows you to use Hand of Light and Illumination to a lesser extent, skills that you&#39;ll usually never use but are however damn good.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Somes bosses and how to fight them efficiently</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Necromancer: <a href="/spoiler">bring a Crusader and/or a Leper to deal with the spawns, easy.</a></li>
<li>Prophet: <a href="/spoiler">bring an occultist with a debuff trinket and a stun resist trinket, spam weakening curse, rumbles will soon deal 0 damage. You may also want a Man-at-arm to protect your guys in the first few turns.</a></li>
<li>Swine King: <a href="/spoiler">bring an arbalest with Rallying flare and a stun resist trinket. Without marks, the damage is easily manageable.</a></li>
<li>Flesh: <a href="/spoiler">Bring 4 Houndmasters, spam Hound&#39;s Harry. Also works with 2-3 Houndmasters, but the more you have, the easier it gets.</a></li>
<li>Hag: <a href="/spoiler">Bring bleeds, lots of them. Given her low HP and the fact that she acts twice a round, she&#39;ll go down quickly. You can also use direct damage. Ignore the pot, when the guy in it gets to death door, he&#39;s automatically flushed out of it.</a></li>
<li>Bringand pounder: <a href="/spoiler">There is no easy strat. Make sure to have a team that will be able to kill the matchman everytime. He&#39;ll quickly be on rank 4, so that would be your backline responsibility (or bring a Hellion). Deal with the adds first (either with stuns or by killing them) and hit the pounder when it&#39;s safe only. If you manage to get a Brigand Bloodletter summoned, the fight should be easier from this point: because he occupies 2 ranks, this means that he will be the only threat during the rest of the fight. Just stun him as often as you can and deal with the matchman and pounder until the pounder breaks.</a></li>
<li>Siren: <a href="/spoiler">Bring 4-8 holy waters, drink them before the fight. Burn down the siren. If one of your heroes is controlled, stun him. Ignore the adds that can get summoned. The Siren has low HP, the safest strat is to rush her down as quickly as possibe.</a></li>
<li>Drowned crew: <a href="/spoiler">Use stuns, deal with the anchor-guys when he has no prot buff, use a dedicated stunner with double trinkets to deal with the anchor-man and deal more damage to the boss, use a mobile party as you tend to be shuffled a lot. Another fun strat is to use a &quot;pull&quot; ability on the boss. If this works, the anchorman will be in the back and won&#39;t have any usable ability. Bring move chance trinkets however, as the boss has very high move resist. This does not work if you push the anchorman to the back. You need to pull the boss to the front. Don&#39;t ask me why.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dungeon specificities - credits to <a href="/u/_GameSHARK">/u/_GameSHARK</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Ruins</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of Unholy monsters. Unholy monsters have impossibly high (200+) Bleed resistance, but have fairly low Blight resistance. Cultists (Human) are also in abundance.</li>
<li>Skeleton Keys and Holy Water are the most common items required for curio interactions. In particular, using Holy Water on the confession booths results in a big stress heal. Eldritch Altars can be cleansed with Holy Water to purge a negative Quirk.</li>
<li>There are few Bleed or Blight monsters to worry about in the Ruins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weald</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of Eldritch and Human monsters, with many monsters having both types. Many monsters have high Blight resistance. Cultists and Bandits (Human) are in abundance here. Be wary of self-Marking here: some monsters are much more deadly against Marked targets.</li>
<li>All items are used fairly equally for curio interaction, with Holy Water being the least common but potentially most useful: purifying effigies can generate a positive quirk.</li>
<li>Bleed and Blight are fairly uncommon. Medicinal Herbs are very useful in higher difficulties to eliminate devastating combat debuffs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warrens</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Beasts galore here, many of which are dual typed with Human. Most monsters have high Blight resistance. Lots of Stress generators here. Many enemies are also capable of inflicting Diseases, as are many curios.</li>
<li>Medicinal Herbs are very useful for curio interactions. There are some (rare) curios that benefit from Holy Water as well.</li>
<li>Bleed is somewhat common, Blight less so. It can be worth packing some bandages on higher difficulties.
Scouting is very valuable in Warrens due to the layout of many maps.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cove</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Eldritch is the name of the game for the Cove: every monster with exception of a single boss is Eldritch. Most monsters feature high Bleed resistance. Groupers do extreme damage with excellent accuracy and crit no matter what position they&#39;re in, to any position on your team. Many monsters have Prot and some monsters can Guard others. Generally speaking, Cove is the hardest area of the game other than Darkest Dungeon. Be wary of going to the Cove before getting equipment upgrades from the Blacksmith and skill upgrades from the Guild.</li>
<li>Medicinal Herbs are extremely useful, both for curio interactions and for purging debuffs resulting from traps. Shovels are also very useful for breaking into chests that Skeleton Keys will not work on.
Neither Bleed nor Blight are especially common.
Scouting is very useful to avoid traps. Traps in the Cove do little damage but apply devastating debuffs that last for a very long time. Bring herbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will conclude my post. It ended up being way longer than I expected it to be, and I&#39;m quite sure I forgot many useful information, but let this be an introduction, I&#39;ll let you fill in more tips. I may edit this post to centralize everything in the future. Thanks for the reading and happy dungeon crawling!</p>

<h2>Enemies weak to being knocked out of position: a quick guide</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/GrossMetal </span>
<span class = "numcomments">21 comments </span>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/6nqwhi/enemies_weak_to_being_knocked_out_of_position_a/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles('6nqwhi')">View full post</button>
<div id="6nqwhi" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Most people aren&#39;t aware or underrate the fact that when certain enemies are knocked out of position, they are forced to use &quot;bad attacks&quot; with low accuracy, little to no crit chance and no secondary effects in order to push themselves back in position.</p>

<p>here&#39;s a quick guide of which enemies this works on and what position they are weak in!</p>

<ul>
<li>Enemies that use bad attacks when knocked to rank 3 or 4:</li>
</ul>

<p>Cultist/Ascended Brawler</p>

<p>Fungal Scratcher</p>

<p>Squiffy Ghast (still a potent stress dealer, but less so)</p>

<p>Templar Impaler/Gladiator (loses access to his deadly stinger stab attack, but can still stun and revelation as normal)</p>

<ul>
<li>Enemies weak to being knocked all the way back to rank 4:</li>
</ul>

<p>Brigand Cutthroat</p>

<p>Bone Rabble (has a weak attack called tic-toc if you knock him to rank 4, but who would bother for such a weak enemy?)</p>

<p>Bone Solider</p>

<ul>
<li>Enemies weak when pulled to rank 1 or 2:</li>
</ul>

<p>Bone Arbalest</p>

<p>Swinetaur</p>

<p>Esquire</p>

<p>Templar Warlord/Sniper (unlike the other one this one becomes quite weak when pulled to the frontline, its essential to make them swap positions in double templar fight!)</p>

<ul>
<li>Enemies weak when pulled to rank 1:</li>
</ul>

<p>Brigand Fusilier</p>

<p>Bone Courtier</p>

<p>Swine Skiver (also has a chance to use his retreat attack in rank 2, but can still use his good attacks)</p>

<p>Pelagic Shaman</p>

<p>Polyp</p>

<ul>
<li>Bosses</li>
</ul>

<p>Crocodilan cannot use his devastating apex predator attack as long as you prevent him from using submerge which he can only do from ranks 2 &amp; 3. Therefore either push or pull him to keep him in ranks 1 or 4, as he has almost no move resist.</p>

<p>So use knockbacks, pulls or shuffles to try to displace these enemies. Remember you don&#39;t always have to directly target them to move them, knocking the enemy in front of them to the back is the same as pulling them.</p>

<p>Anyways, good knowledge of these weaknesses lets you abuse MaA ramparts, BH uppercut, leper purge, Occ pull, Arbalest&#39; bola, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<h2>Rank the class from best to worst - including DLC if you've played it</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to look up a best class ranking, but most of them are probably pretty outdated by now. They don&#39;t include new classes like Flagellant and Shieldbreaker, and I know certain classes like the Hound Master have nerfed since then.
