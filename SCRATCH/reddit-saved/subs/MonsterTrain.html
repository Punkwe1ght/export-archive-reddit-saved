<h2>20 Tips & Tricks for beginners</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/MrJimsGaming </span><span class = "numcomments">22 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterTrain/comments/hadmno/20_tips_tricks_for_beginners/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(726)">View full post</button><div id="726" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What is up Monster Trainer. I&#39;ve wanted to do a Beginner&#39;s guide for quite a while with Monster Train  and as i gained experience, i felt like now would be a good time to do it ! So, i will give you 20 Tips and Tricks that i think can be useful for beginners and even more advanced players ( maybe not ). And before we get into the details, i am quite new here so this is my way to introduce myself and sorry if my english is not perfect ! Na&#39;vi is my main language. So let&#39;s get into those tips and tricks ; </p>

<p><strong>1- TARGETING SPELLS.</strong></p>

<p>As you start your run, you  should always consider adding some targeting spells or AOE damage spells in your deck. That is why for me, personally, hellhorned is the best allied clan of the game. Just because of the torch spell. What i mean by targeting spells, is spells that can be use on the unit of  your choice in the train. And even you own units in some cases. It is really useful early game to kill the gold unit that gives gold ( forget his name), kill the back enemy units, ( A lot of the time they are the units with the most attack but low hp. Early game it is the archer and you can kill it with a 2 damage targeting spells. ), make space on your train ( you can kill your own imp by example to make space for other units, because after the summon effect, they are quite useless). Here are some targeting spells or AOE spells that are quite useful early game : </p>

<p>Hellhorned : Torch, Vent, Molting Imp</p>

<p>Awoken: Vine Grasp,Grimmer</p>

<p>Stygian Guard :Flash Freeze</p>

<p>Umbra: Mine Collapse,Antumbra Assault</p>

<p>Melting Remnant : A Fatal Melting,Subsuming Blade.</p>

<p><strong>2- LOOK WHO THE FINAL BOSS IS WHEN YOU START  YOUR RUN</strong></p>

<p>This is just a little tip here. When you start your run, you can look on the top right corner who will be the final boss. And this can be quite useful. You can build around it or prevent a hard counter from him. Here are the final bosses you can get ;</p>

<p>-Seraph The Diligent : The boss will consume the first spell  you play each turn. So a nice way to play against this is having a deck with a lot of spells or on the other hand, having a deck who don&#39;t rely too much on spells.</p>

<p>-Seraph The Chaste: Will remove half of the buffs and debuffs every turn. So if you are building a rage deck, spell weakness deck or even frosbite deck by exemple, he will remove half of effects every turn.</p>

<p>-Seraph The Temperant: The boss will SAP our units. ( SAP= we lose attack damage).So be careful, if you have low attack multistrike units, they can get to zero damage.</p>

<p><strong>3- GO FOR THE TRIALS. ( ESPECIALLY EARLY GAME )</strong></p>

<p>You want to go for the trials early game. As a new player, you probably cannot judge if you should do it  or not because you lack experience, but i cannot see a time when i don&#39;t go for the trial on the first stage. Especially low covenant. Don&#39;t be afraid to trade some HP for more powers. High risk high rewards right ? I see a lot of my friends who just started the game and they are too scared to go for &#39;&#39;hard mode &#39;&#39;. But go for it ! You need the power spike early game. You need the extra unit. You need the gold to ugrades your units or spells. If by bad luck it cost you the game, just restart. As the game progress though, you should be more careful. They are some trials that can really counter your <a href="https://deck.here">deck</a>. Here are some examples ;</p>

<p>-Spell shied 2 : Can hard counter your spell deck.</p>

<p>-Spikes: Can hard counter your multistrike/low hp hellhorned deck by example.</p>

<p>- Restore all health when they move up a floor (Can&#39;t remember the name) : Can hard counter your frosbite deck. And for me personally, it is the hardest trial of all. Will talk more down below about this trial. </p>

<p><strong>4-DON&#39;T BE SCARED TO USE PYRE HEALTH AS A RESOURCE</strong></p>

<p>Your pyre health is a resource.They are time when it is better to trade some hp for more powers or just to set up your board.Trials are a good example. Some trials will make you lose some hp, but it is worth the power spike that it will give you. As a new player i did this a lot, i never wanted to take a single hit. So if i have an enemy unit on the third floor, i would waste all my embers on him just so i don&#39;t take a single hit. But what i should have done is set up my board for the next phase who is the boss fight. That is an example. Or if you have the purge cards in your hands that, at the end of your turn you take 1,3 or 5 damage,consider taking the damage. Sometime it is better to not waste your embers on those cards and just play normally. Because if you waste your embers by getting rid of those cards, you can really fall behind. But it is situational. If you have 4 times the card that does 5 damage in your hand, you should probably play them So with experience, you will learn to hold the balance between taking some hits for more powers,etc. But taking 1 or even 10 damage is not the end of the world ! </p>

<p><strong>5-THE ASCEND/DESCEND MECHANIC</strong></p>

<p>Ok. You have to pick those cards. When i first started playing this game, i would never picked those cards ! I was like : meh, this is fine but not worth picking up. MISTAKE. The ascend/descend mechanic is a REALLY STRONG mechanic that can win you a lot of games. Maybe you don&#39;t know it, but <strong>you can stack up to 7 units per floor</strong>. Even if they cost 5 spaces each, you can do it. But 7 units is  the maximum ( I will talk more of this down below). So imagine a board with 2 units on each floor vs a floor with 6 units. Guess which one is better ? Especially for boss fight. You can ascend/descend your own units and even enemy units. You can do some pretty nice combos too with this. An example, there is a relic that daze x3 the enemies when they move floor between the ascension phase.What does this mean ? It means if you ascend an enemy, it will be dazed for three turns. That is really strong ! And you can ascend the enemies on the pyre room too. That can be quite good too. You have to think about those options.If you have an enemy on the third floor with zero attack but a lot of armor, just ascend it on the pyre room and kill the enemy behind him. There is a lof of things you can do with those mechanics, so really consider picking those cards ! </p>

<p><strong>6-YOU CAN&#39;T STACK MORE THAN 7 UNITS PER FLOOR</strong></p>

<p>As i said before, the ascend/descend mechanic is really strong, but be CAREFUL. You cannot stack more than 7 units per floor. Same thing for the enemies. It can caught you by surprise. If you have 7 enemy units on that floor, they will just skip the floor and move one floor higher. If on the ascension phase you had 4 rooted enemies on the third floor and you had 4 enemies on the second floor, they will stack up  to 7 on the third floor and the remaining one will go to the pyre room <a href="https://directly.You">directly. You</a> should always consider this. It is rare that you will face this situation, but this can happen and it can end you run in the blink of an eye ! Be CAREFUL !</p>

<p><strong>7-ALWAYS UPGRADE YOUR UNITS/SPELLS BEFORE GOING INTO THE CAVERN</strong></p>

<p>If you have a merchant with a cavern, go to the merchant first. There is only one time i think when it is better to go the cavern first ( correct me if i&#39;m wrong guys) and it is when you have the event that your pyre gains attack equal to the gold you have on you. So if you use the gold before entering the cavern, you pyre will get less attack. But this is a gamble and it is not worth. Always go for the merchant first. And for two reasons. <strong>The first is, you can upgrade your units or spells in the cavern without loosing a upgrade space</strong>. What i mean by that is, if you used your two upgrades on your unit by example and you go into the cavern, you CAN still upgrade it ! So you will have three upgrade on him even if two was the limit. BUT, if you go to the cavern first and you have one remaining upgrade on your unit, it will use it. And when you go back to the shop after this, you would not be able to upgrade it, So you lost one upgrade space. <strong>Always maximize your upgrades.</strong> The second reason is, in the cavern you can duplicate cards, so you want your units or spells to be the strongest possible ! <strong>Because if you enter the cavern,you cannot go back.</strong> So always upgrades before going into the cavern.</p>

<p><strong>8-ALWAYS GO THE CAVERN BEFORE DUPLICATING</strong></p>

<p>It may sound a bit confusing because i said earlier go the shops first and then the cavern, but when you face a situation where you can go to a cavern and you can duplicate cards, go for the cavern first.There is ZERO time where it is better to go the cavern first. And for a simple reason, you wan to duplicate strong cards. Same thing as i said earlier, in the cavern you can find some upgrades for your cards. So upgrade your cards and duplicate them. </p>

<p><strong>9-DON&#39;T BE SCARED TO BUILD YOUR CHAMPION HYBRID</strong></p>

<p>I remember when i started playing this game, i would ALWAYS stick to one upgrade for my champion. I don&#39;t know why. And i think a lot of new players are like me. We want to commit to one mechanic and one upgrade for our champion. But there is a lot of games where it is better to switch for another upgrade/mechanic. A good example of this is with the awoken champion. If you pick at first the rejuvenate mechanic and later on you realize you would like more card draws for more cheap spells, maybe you should consider picking the revenge mechanic that draw cards when you get hit. It can give you a huge power boost ! I think this come with experience, and you will have a better understanding of which one is better as your run progress. But don&#39;t be scared to build your champion hybrid and try different combinations!</p>

<p><strong>10-MOST OF THE TIME, IT IS BETTER TO UPGRADE YOUR UNITS EARLY GAME</strong></p>

<p>The first floor is always the same. They offer you two choices ; left a unit shops with a unit draft and right a spell shop with another unit draft. Most of the time you want to go for units shop. They are time when maybe it is better to go for the spell shop, If by example you would like this particular unit draft or if you want to try a specific deck. But most of the time, the unit upgrade is way better ! Buffing a unit early game can give you such a big power spike ! And if you are lucky with the unit draft and the upgrades, you can just duplicate it  to have two of it ! That is a strong early game strategy. </p>

<p><strong>11-TEST EVERYTHING,TRY EVERY EVENTS.</strong></p>

<p>Try everything ! You can do so much thing in this game ! You can find some combos you would never have think of ! You can find relics that have such a good synergy with your deck. Same thing goes for the events. Some events may looks bad but later on they give you powerful things. Try every events at least once and you can be surprise with what you can come up with. That is what make this game so fun ! <strong>AND IF YOU SEE THE BONE&#39;S DOG FAVOR CARD, TAKE IT</strong> ! This is one of the rarest card in the game and you want it golden !</p>

<p><strong>12-IF YOU SEE THE X MARK ON THE BOSS, BE CAREFUL... JUST END TURN FFS.</strong></p>

<p>This one may sound silly, but it happened to me a couple times. We won the fight, but we want to keep things going. It is normal right ? We all do this. We want to maximize our turn and finish the boss in beauty. Or maybe we just want to be BM? :) .But it can caught you by surprise. Not only with the boss but with the enemy units too. You see the X mark, you play a card and BOOM, now they gain armor and don&#39;t die. This is just a little friendly tip here. Be careful of what you play if you see the X mark on the enemy. Especially if you are a new player and you may forget about one mechanic or one effect.</p>

<p><strong>13-YOU SHOULD USE PURGE/CONSUME MECHANIC TO REMOVE CARDS FROM YOUR DECK</strong></p>

<p>Another nice way to remove cards, is with the consume or purge mechanic. This is a good way to make your deck more consistent. Especially if you go higher in the covenants, they give so much cards that you don&#39;t need, it is always good to remove cards and make your deck consistent. With the consume effect,you can remove a card from your deck but only for the fight. It is not permanently but it is definitely worth it. It will make your deck better for the whole fight. Same thing for the purge mechanic but this is even better, because it is for the whole run ! So if the game offer you some purge or consume effects, consider giving it to a card you think you will only use once or a card you want to remove from your deck. It is also a nice way to end things in beauty. Maybe you want to do this on a card you know will be your finishing move or a way to use a card as a last resort to save you. You can use those effects in so many situations. Example you have a spell weakness deck,consider giving the consume effect to your strongest spell ( because you gain power with the consume effect) and use it as your finishing move on the boss. This with permafrost is the dream right !  </p>

<p><strong>14-UPGRADING X MECHANIC CARDS IS A NICE WAY TO USE IT FOR FREE.</strong></p>

<p>What i mean by that is, if you have an attack spell card that cost X embers, you can use it for free if you upgrade it with spell powers. Take Vent by exemple, it deals AOE 2x damage to enemy units. So if you upgrade it with +10 magic power, you can use it at zero ember. Because at zero ember you will do 2x0 damage to enemy BUT you upgraded it with +10 magic power. So at zero ember you can still do 10 damage to enemy units. You can use this with a lot of cards ! Mine collapse is a card that you deal 3x damage to an enemy unit and gain 2 ember if you slay it. Guess what! Upgrade it with +10 magic power and at zero ember you deal 10 damage to a unit and gain 2 free embers ! As a new player, you might miss this, so this is a good think to keep in mind when you can upgrade your cards !</p>

<p><strong>15-THE LAST FIGHT IS HARD, THE BIRDS IN THE BACK CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGES</strong></p>

<p>This is more of a little tip that i want to give to new players here. In the lat fight you will have a unit in the front with a lot of hp ( That you have to deal with or you pyre will take a lot of damage ) and a couple bird in the back that hits like a TRUCK.But the thing is, they have low hp !.So they are easy to deal with, but they can caught you by surprise if you don&#39;t have a way to deal with them. You can easily deal with them with targeting spells,sweep, AOE spells, some relics or if you deck is strong, just raw power. But keep in mind that if you have a hard time killing the front enemy units and you can&#39;t deal with them, well, your pyre will be in a bad shape.An example is, one time i had such a strong umbra deck, my unit had so much lifesteal and damage shield, but i had no way to kill those birds. I could kill the first unit easily but i had no way to kill those birds in the back. So i lost before going into the final wave.</p>

<p><strong>16-TRY THE MULTIPLAYER MODE</strong></p>

<p>This is not really a tip, more of a suggestion for you. Go try the multiplayer mode ! It is kinda fun. The hellrush mode is like a normal game but with other players with you. It forces you to play faster because you have a time limit for each round, so i don&#39;t know, it adds something. The only thing i think is missing is, in my opinion, a way to chat with other players ! But it is still really fun ! And you have the daily challenges that you can do to compete with other players for a high scores. And you can create custom games too to share with your friends or other peoples. So go take a look at it ! </p>

<p><strong>17-SPELL WEAKNESS TIPS</strong></p>

<p>This is more of a specific tip than a general tip and i wanted to talk about this mechanic especially for one reason, i think new players have a hard time playing this mechanic ( Stygian guard). Feel free in the comment section to talk about it because this is my personal experience with this mechanic and i would really like your thought about this ! So, i think when we first try this mechanic, we play it wrong. When i first started, i thought this mechanic was not that strong. But i was playing it wrong. What i mean by that is,  the way you should play it is, try to add the most spell weaknesses on the boss BUT do not attack it before the final wave ! Sometimes the boss will have like 12 spell weakness on him and he is on the first floor with the other enemy units. So you use a aoe spell to kill the units but you hit the boss too. I think this is wrong ! You should find a way to never hit the boss with spells until the final wave. Stack the most spell weaknesses that you can and finish it with your biggest spell ! It is way better to have a strong spell with 40 spell weaknesses than it is to play a couple spells on a 9 spell weaknesses boss. And most of the time you cannot use your biggest spell on the boss before the final wave because you need to deal with the enemy units. They are exception right, if you need to do a aoe spell to survive, go for it. But most of the time i think you should not hit the boss before the final wave ! </p>

<p><strong>18- TRIAL THAT RESTORE HEALTH WHEN ENEMIES MOVE UP A FLOOR</strong></p>

<p>As i said earlier, i think this trial is the hardest one and as a new player, you should really be careful with this ! It can end your run pretty quickly. It happened to me, i looked at the third floor and i see one enemy with 80 hp. I do my maths and i realize that at the end of the turn it will have 6 hp left. So i think; hey this is fine. i will take one damage from him on the pyre room. I can deal with that. BUT NO NO NO. It will restore all health and you will take a LOT of damage. It is really easy to forget about this, so when you pick this trial, always keep in mind that if you don&#39;t kill the enemies on that floor, you have to start all over on the next floor. You need a strong deck to deal with this. It counters the frostbite mechanics so HARD. Be careful guys.</p>

<p><strong>19-REMOVING CARDS IS REALLY STRONG IN THIS GAME</strong></p>

<p>You have a lot of opportunities to remove cards in this game, so make a good use of it ! The best way to win a game is to have a consistent deck. So remove the MOST card you <a href="https://can.As">can.</a> As you go higher in the covenants, they give you a lot of cards so it is really hard to have a consistent deck. So that is why it is important to remove cards. Remove those train stewards. Remove those frost lance. You can remove card in every shops. You can remove cards in the caverns. You can remove up to two cards with the vortex ( is it the name of it? ) . You can remove cards with consume and purge. So REMOVE CARDS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>20-LOOK AT WHAT&#39;S NEXT</strong></p>

<p>When you start your run, look at every floor. You can have a better understanding on what you want to do next or on which path you should go. This is common sense but i see a lot of people who never do this ! You are on the second floor, you have to choose between going left to duplicate your cards or right to get a relic. Take a look at what is next and ask yourself: ok if i don&#39;t duplicate here, the next one is three floors lower, so maybe i should do it now.  This is just an example but by looking at everything, it can really help you on what to do next. </p>

<p><strong>THIS IS IT</strong></p>

<p>Thank you guys for taking the time to read my post ! I would really like some honest feedback because i am thinking about making a whole series on this. I want to do specific videos and topics for each champions,clans and more. English not being my main language is a real challenge to me, so i hope you didn&#39;t had a hard time reading me !  And if you want to see this topic in a video, a made a video version of it on youtube :  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzxIzDr5GQw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzxIzDr5GQw</a> </p>

<p>Have a great day everyone</p>
