For the sake of keeping it (relatively) brief I&#39;m going to be focusing on gameplay elements, however I will leave a link at the bottom of this post to  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Zherlum/">u/Zherlum</a>&#39;s steam forum post, which goes over a bunch of additional details such as story.</p>

<p><strong>1 - New Combat Features</strong></p>

<p>A whole host of new features have been shown off with the recent gameplay, with ranged now taking a bit more of the limelight Fatshark seem to have taken some steps to bring the FPS experience as a whole in line with what we would expect from most other shooters.</p>

<p>Movement has seen a major change, with players now being able to sprint, vault and slide, which have all been added alongside the dodge from Vermintide.</p>

<p>Shield bars have also been added to our health now, providing a buffer against incoming ranged damage. Shield regenerates over time, with regeneration based on how many teammates are grouped together, and also regenerates with melee kills. The shield is only designed to stop ranged damage however, any melee damage immediately removes all shield, however that first hit does not do health damage.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>2 - Enemies</strong></p>

<p>Enemy variety in Darktide so far seems to be pretty substantial, with a wide array of enemies with varying equipment and roles. These enemies all come from the dredges of the hive city itself, or the Moebian 6th infantry. As an elite regiment, the Moebians have a large amount of prestige to their name and are a force to be reckoned with. The devs recently confirmed in their Hybrid combat blog post that enemies will be following a similar structure as before, split into different &quot;types&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Roamers/Hordes</strong></p>

<p>The major bulk of what we will be cleaving our way through, this seems to be a mixture of cultists, pox walkers and elements of the Moebian 6th traitor guard. They come thick and fast, and fall apart spectacularly under sustained fire.</p>

<p><strong>Elites</strong></p>

<p>Rarer, tougher enemies that are designed to challenge the player and encourage certain approaches to dealing with them, this category seems to include the Chaos Ogryns, as well as some of the more well equipped traitor guard.</p>

<p><strong>Specials</strong></p>

<p>More specialized enemies designed to keep players on their toes and enforce cooperation. They will either single you out at range or pin you down to take you out of a fight, a test of your ability to identify targets and deal with them appropriately . At the moment this seems to include stuff such as traitor snipers, or pox walkers with bombs strapped to them.</p>

<p><strong>Unspecified list</strong></p>

<p>The aforementioned categories don&#39;t currently list the enemies that fulfil each role, but here is a list of everything we know of so far that will oppose us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Poxwalkers (also Poxwalker with meltabomb strapped to it)</li>
<li>Melee Cultists</li>
<li>Melee Traitor Guard (i.e. chainaxe)</li>
<li>Ranged Traitor Guard (Lasguns)</li>
<li>Grenadier Traitor Guard (throw grenades)</li>
<li>Special Weapon Traitor Guard (Plasma gun, ToxFlamer, hotshot volleygun, sniper)</li>
<li>Ogryn melee (2h or stick and shield)</li>
<li>Ogryn ranged (using a twinlinked heavy stubber)</li>
<li>Chaos Hound</li>
<li>Plague Ogryn</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>3.Weapons</strong></p>

<p>Weapons are going to play a major part in how you function in Darktide, defining your role within a party and what things you are specialized into (i.e. a ripper gun is incredible at tearing through hordes, but can&#39;t punch through armour)</p>

<p>Weapons are customisable, with both optics and front mount (flashlight/bayonet) attachments having been seen in gameplay. They also come with &#39;abilities&#39; built into them, such as the plasma gun being able to overcharge or the chainsword being able to rev up and lock onto a single enemy, for additional damage and armour penetration. A link to a weapon customisation blog was posted recently, but has been withheld as it was not ready.</p>

<p>We have also seen 3 variants of the Lasgun so far, as of yet it is unconfirmed if this is purely cosmetic or if we will have patterns with statistical differences, it is more likely it is weapon skins.</p>

<p><strong>Weapons List</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Galaxy Pattern Lasgun (and carbine)</li>
<li>Accatran Pattern Lasgun</li>
<li>Plasma Gun</li>
<li>Autogun</li>
<li>Flamer</li>
<li>Bolter</li>
<li>Ripper Gun</li>
<li>Ogryn Tube launcher</li>
<li>Stub Revolver</li>
<li>Shotgun (confirmed in edge article)</li>
<li>Auto Pistol and knife combo</li>
<li>Force staff with psy powers</li>
<li>Chainsword</li>
<li>Force Sword</li>
<li>Power Sword</li>
<li>Power Hammer</li>
<li>Ogryn Knife</li>
<li>Ogryn shield</li>
<li>Ogryn Power Maul</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grenades</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Frag grenade</li>
<li>Incendiary grenade</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>4.Classes and Characters</strong></p>

<p>Probably the biggest step away from Vermintide is that Darktide does away with pre-set characters in favour of classes with custom characters. This does not, however, mean that the game is entirely devoid of character. Fatshark have attempted to implement a rather large, context sensitive, speech system which, when paired with the multiple voice options per class, allows for potentially decently organic experience. How this system is implemented isn&#39;t fully revealed yet, but there has been mention of backgrounds, multiple voices as well as both male and female options for everyone, bar the Ogryn which is gender locked to male. There will be 3 voices per gender, with over 75,000 voice lines recorded, which should provide us with a varied experience.</p>

<p>All of the Characters are convicts, picked up by the inquisition as disposable assets to use in the war for Atoma Prime. Over the course of the game our characters will attempt to gain a reputation and rise through the ranks of this taskforce, which will be reflected by dialogue changing depending on your current level.</p>

<p>The 4 classes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ogryn - heavy weapons class, has a charge that knocks enemies back</li>
<li>Psyker - 40k mage equivalent, ability unconfirmed</li>
<li>Zealot - melee focused class, ability to dash in any direction</li>
<li>Veteran - Ranged focused class, ability improves zoom, highlights specials and increases headshot damage for a time</li>
</ul>

<p>Each class has a talent tree, a unique weapons list containing 5-7 weapons per slot, unique grenades, abilities and shield gauges. Not much is known about the specifics of this as of yet.</p>

<p><strong>5.Maps and missions</strong></p>

<p>There will be a instanced hub, which they would like to be able to take 20 players per instance. The entire Hub will be in 3rd person perspective and is based within the Mourningstar, the voidship from which we are deploying. This area is where all of the crafting and pre mission prep takes place.</p>

<p>There will be a variety of maps in the game, ranging from underhive sprawls through to the connecting bridges of the upper spires. These zones will vary aesthetic, and provide a much more thorough look into a hive city than we have been provided before. Some confirmed zones of interest are a market place, a prison, a hab zone and the maintenance tunnels. The gameplay from the recent event takes place in the underhive, and leads through to a leman russ factory.</p>

<p>Missions will be generated on a mission board, and will have 2 modifiers that combine together to give a &quot;difficulty&quot; (i.e. one being enemy density). They can also spawn with additional mutators such as Black out or acid rain, which entirely change how a mission might be played (i.e black out having only a limited number of light sources in the mission itself)</p>

<p>Contracts can be chosen, similar to Vermintide 1. These will require you to fulfil a certain a certain set of tasks, then reward toy with an item. The item is defined by the contract you pick up, and can be anything from resources through too a guaranteed red item or cosmetic.</p>

<p>I will attempt to keep on top of information and update this as more rolls out. If you want a more in depth dive, as mentioned above there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Zherlum/">u/Zherlum</a>&#39;s post over on the steam forums, who covers a bunch of additional information such as artists and writers</p>
