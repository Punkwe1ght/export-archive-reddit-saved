<p>The wattage controls how much power is taken from the battery to heat the cart. If your battery is fully charged, put it at a lower wattage. If your battery is dying, increase it. (Unless you’re a cloud chaser, which seems wasteful with thc carts)</p>

<p>I set my vape at 2.7 at full charge, 3.5 at half charge, and 3.8 at less than 30%, then I charge it and lower the wattage again. </p>

<p>Don’t use full wattage on a full battery, don’t use low wattage on a dying one.</p>
