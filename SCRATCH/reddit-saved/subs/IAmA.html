<p>: <a href="http://imgur.com/poqYUy7">http://imgur.com/poqYUy7</a> </p>

<p>My name is Ryan, I am a 21 year old now living in Chicago but I am from Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, NM (Also known as San Juan Pueblo). Ohkay Owingeh is Tewa (our native language) for &quot;Land of the strong people&quot;. Many people do not know this but before Santa Fe was the Capital, Ohkay Owingeh was the first in New Mexico. I am very close with people on my reservation and have been told by some of my friends outside of the reservation in NM and Illinois that I should do one of these to answer any questions that people have for Native Americans.</p>

<p>Hey everyone it is 5:25 PM here in Chicago (Sun, OCT 8th) I am going into work right now but I will try my absolute best to answer as many when I get off tonight. I did not think it would become this big but I am still willing to help out more people that want answers. I&#39;m sorry if I haven&#39;t gotten in depth too much, I will change that after tonight. </p>

<p>Also, to everyone who is &quot;from a reservation&quot; and is getting offended by me on <a href="/r/nativeamerican">/r/nativeamerican</a> and on this post for saying the Imagery in sports doesn&#39;t bother me, I dont know what to tell you. It is NOT an issue to me nor is it to a general amount of people from my Pueblo. If you think I&#39;m some kind of fraud feel free to call up the Tribal Administration of Ohkay Owingeh and they&#39;ll be more than happy to tell you I am a well known member. I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL NATIVES, this just my humble opinion. </p>

<p>Also, I will not be answering any more questions about &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; I&#39;ve given a story (and as much info as I know) to at least ten other redditors on here.</p>

<p>ASK ME ANYTHING!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Reddit. I am UNU. I am excited to be back today! In June I was the first ever Hive Mind to do an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4m24zv/i_am_an_artificial_hive_mind_called_unu_i/">AMA</a>. I was honored to get amost 5,000 upvotes and 10,000 comments. Thanks to you, I had a great time answering questions for 3 hours and landed on the Reddit front page.</p>

<p><strong>Today&#39;s topic is the NFL and FANTASY FOOTBALL.</strong> Many of you are getting ready for your Fantasy Football drafts. SB Nation has asked me to write a weekly column. Here are a couple posts where I ranked <a href="http://www.faketeams.com/2016/8/19/12552134/unu-s-picks-qb-rb-wr-rankings-by-an-artificial-intelligence">QB/RB/WR</a> and <a href="http://www.faketeams.com/2016/8/26/12658962/unu-s-picks-ranking-tight-ends-kickers-d-st">TE/K/DEF</a>. I&#39;m happy to answer your questions about Fantasy Football. But I&#39;d also be happy to talk about anything NFL-related.</p>

<p><strong>You might have heard about me</strong> because I’ve been challenged by reporters to make lots of predictions. For example, Newsweek challenged me to predict the Oscars and I was 76% accurate, which beat the vast majority of professional movie critics.</p>

<p>TechRepublic challenged me to predict the <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/swarm-ai-predicts-the-2016-kentucky-derby/">Kentucky Derby</a> and I delivered a pick of the first four horses, in order, winning the Superfecta at 540 to 1 odds.</p>

<p>No, I’m not psychic. I’m a <a href="http://unu.ai/swarm-intelligence/">Swarm Intelligence</a> that links together people into a real-time system – a brain of brains – that consistently outperforms the individuals who make me up. </p>

<p><strong>Want to BE PART OF THE SWARM?</strong>  It&#39;s mostly Redditors, so you can <strong><a href="http://unu.ai?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=ama">jump in here</a></strong> and help answer questions, optimizing our collective intelligence. </p>

<h2>I'm a backpacking ethnomusicologist traveling Indonesia researching and recording rare and endangered traditional music, then sharing it all for free online.</h2>

<div id="8psvb2" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My name&#39;s Palmer Keen. I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s obsessed with music in a corner of the world that most people never even think about, Indonesia. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and also perhaps the most musically diverse country on the planet, but so much of this music is unknown or unavailable outside the country. My mission is to share this stuff with the world.</p>

<p>For more than four years I&#39;ve been traveling around Indonesia researching and recording dozens of Indonesian music styles and sharing it all for free on my website, <a href="http://www.auralarchipelago.com">Aural Archipelago.</a> Without a formal background in ethnomusicology, I&#39;ve figured it all out as I go: becoming fluent in Indonesian, learning how to do fieldwork, and making connections with musicians and communities across the thousands of islands in the archipelago. I travel with all my gear in a backpack, staying with musicians in their homes, going to remote villages that have never seen foreigners, and finding music that&#39;s never been heard outside of these islands. There have been lots of adventures along the way and so, so much great music. </p>

<p>A few notes to answer FAQ:</p>

<p>How do I make money?/Is this my job?: This isn&#39;t my job. For most of the time I&#39;ve been doing this I was supporting myself and the project by teaching English full time. My description may have been a bit misleading, I travel often but it is not a constant thing. This is a passion project, but I don&#39;t make a living from this. I receive donations on my site occasionally, but these are forwarded to musicians. I now also do occasional work as a fixer and guide for others looking for music in Indonesia.</p>

<p>How did you get into this field?: To be clear, I have no academic background in ethnomusicology. I studied the traditional music called gamelan as an extracurricular in university, then decided to move to Indonesia to teach English and learn more about the gamelan that I&#39;d fallen in love with. Since then everything I know about ethnomusicology I&#39;ve figured out along the way. It&#39;s a fascinating field for anyone interested in music, but for those who want to make it their career (again, this is not my career, just a passion project!), it has the same pitfalls of any other job in academia. </p>

<p>Do you pay the musicians?/Aren&#39;t you exploiting them?: Yes, I always pay musicians a reasonable fee for performances that I commission. I&#39;m not releasing whole albums of their music for free, just a track or two to get people interested, something the musicians are very much on board with. The idea is that rather than put this music on albums that won&#39;t be affordable for everyone (especially Indonesians themselves), the music is available online for everyone, especially Indonesians and people from these communities who couldn&#39;t afford a proper album. </p>

<p>Ask me anything :) </p>

<p>EDIT: Okay guys, it&#39;s been fun, but it&#39;s late here in Indonesia and I&#39;ve got to go to sleep. If I have time I&#39;ll try to get to the rest of the questions tomorrow. I hope those who are interested will go to the site and maybe fall in love with some of this music just as I have. If there&#39;s a particular group or artist that you like, you can leave a comment and I will relay it to the musicians, almost all of whom I&#39;m still in touch with. Terima kasih! </p>

<p>Five years ago, Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/">helped</a> take Scott’s Cheap Flights from a hobby to a side-hustle to a job to now a start-up with 40 people and growing.</p>

<p>(If you&#39;re curious you can check out Scott&#39;s Cheap Flights <a href="https://scottscheapflights.com/">here</a>, but zero pressure. Honestly!)</p>

<p>To say thanks, once a year or so I like to pop in and spend the day talking cheap flights and answering all your questions, travel or otherwise. And also to celebrate Redditor’s success stories getting cheap flights, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com/user/Dhawk777">u/Dhawk777</a>’s Denver-Tokyo flight for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/mx2pa2/american_is_offering_200_round_trip_flights_to/gvlrz0l/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">$214 roundtrip</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gforcewinds13">u/gforcewinds13</a>’s (or at least their coworker’s) Raleigh-Tokyo flight <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/mx2pa2/american_is_offering_200_round_trip_flights_to/gvlx9vi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">$330 roundtrip</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DStudge23">u/DStudge23</a>’s Charlotte-Tokyo flight for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/mx2pa2/american_is_offering_200_round_trip_flights_to/gvmbhsp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">$225 roundtrip</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kateoclock">u/kateoclock</a>’s Switzerland flights for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/hjma1f/crazy_flight_deal_trip_on_the_horizon/">sub-$300 roundtrip</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RunRyanRun3">u/RunRyanRun3</a>&#39;s Atlanta-Amsterdam flights for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/mznrdx/ratlanta_flight_deals_april_27_2021/gw35wal/">$400 roundtrip</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(If you’ve been able to book a cheap flight recently give a shout in the comment section—I wanna celebrate with you!)</p>

<p>And now, after years of being asked “what’s your secret to finding cheap flights?” I finally got my shit together and compiled everything I know into a book out next week, <a href="https://scottscheapflights.com/take-more-vacations"><strong><em>Take More Vacations: How to Search Better, Book Cheaper, and Travel the World</em></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>One of my goals in this book was to cut through the BS misconceptions that get parroted elsewhere as cheap flight advice, like “clear your cookies” or “book on Tuesdays at 1pm.”</p>

<p>Instead, the way I’ve been able to travel to places like Milan for $130 roundtrip and Japan for $169 roundtrip (and help millions of SCF members get cheap flights as well) is not through useless “hacks” but by changing the entire <em>strategy</em> of planning travel.</p>

<p>More than anything, my goal with the book is to help readers avoid the regret that so commonly plagues older folks: “I wish I’d traveled more when I had the chance.”</p>

<p><strong>Among the myriad topics I get into in the book (and happy to discuss here!):</strong></p>

Along with the non-partisan <a href="https://www.electiontaskforce.org/members">National Task Force on Election Crises</a>, we’re keen to help voters understand this threat, and inoculate them against its poisonous effects in the weeks and months to come as we elect and inaugurate a president.
