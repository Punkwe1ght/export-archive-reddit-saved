<p><strong>One Night in Turin</strong> - Follows England&#39;s fairytale run to the semi-finals of Italia 90 and the problems between English fans and Italian police whilst abroad.

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GAMMhGn5Sc"><strong>G&#39;ole, Offical movie of the 1982 World Cup</strong></a> - in Portuguese but contains all the goals and highlights. The english version is narrated by Sean Connery but I can&#39;t find it anywhere.  </p>

<p>Every official World Cup movie from 1970 to 2006 is somewhere online but almost none of them are in English. If you speak portuguese or spanish just search for the movie on Google and you will find it pretty easily and you&#39;ll understand the narrator.  </p>

<h3>Current League Format</h3>

<p>Currently, J.League Division 1 is contested between 18 clubs, Division 2 between 22 clubs, and Division 3 between 13 clubs. This brings the J.League to a grand total of 53 fully professional clubs. There is a promotion / relegation system in place throughout the league pyramid.</p>

<p><strong>Two Stage System</strong></p>

<p>Starting this year J.League Division 1 will use a two-stage &quot;mini-league&quot; system, culminating in Post Season Playoffs and a Championship Series.</p>

<p>This is how qualification for the Post Season Playoffs is set up:</p>

<ul>
<li>The winner of each stage earn a home berth in the first round of the playoffs. Whichever one of these has the most points in the overall league table is the top seed and will play all of their playoff matches at home.</li>
<li>The teams with the second-most and third-most points over the entire season also qualify for the playoffs, bringing the total to 4 clubs.</li>
<li>The stage winner with the most points plays against the third-place finisher and the stage winner with fewer points plays the second-place finisher.</li>
<li>When the playoffs are complete the winner will face the team with the most points over the entire year in a home-and-away Championship Series.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a visual of the playoff system (from what I can tell):</p>

<pre><code> #1 Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall 
                                      &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2 ------
 #2 Stage Winner vs 2nd Place Overall 
                                                                   &gt;  Home and Away Championship Series                  
 Overall League Table Winner --------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>As you can probably tell, there is a chance that some teams may qualify in more than one way, at which point the playoffs will be shortened accordingly. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the First Stage Champion also has the most points over the full season, they qualify directly for the Championship Series (they do not participate in the playoffs)</li>
<li>In the above example, the Second Stage Champion would play against the full-season third-place finisher, and the winner of that match would face the full-season second-place team.</li>
<li> If the Second Stage Champion also compiled the second- or third-most points over the full season, there would only be one other team in position to qualify for the playoffs. In that case, only one playoff match would be needed.</li>
<li>In practice, the playoffs may often involve just three teams, with one playoff match (between the second and third point-getters) followed by a home-and-away Championship Series.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above explanation about the format of the Playoffs is taken directly from <a href="http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/japanese-football-gets-new-format">this article by Ken Matsushima</a>, because I still have a hard time understanding how they will work.</p>

<p><strong>Asian Champions League Qualification</strong></p>

<p>For 2015 Japan has been allocated 3+1 spot in the Champions League group stage, which they distribute across their tournaments like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Champion and Runner-up in the J.League automatically qualify</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Emperor%27s_Cup">Emperor&#39;s Cup</a> Champion automatically qualifies</li>
<li>The 3rd place finisher overall in the J.League gains entry to the final play-off round of the Champions League qualifying playoffs</li>
</ul>

<p>The clubs participating in the 2015 Asian Champions League are Gamba Osaka, Urawa Red Diamonds, Kashima Antlers, and (entering in the play-off round) Kashiwa Reysol.</p>

<p><em>Champions League Playoff Update</em></p>

<p>Kashiwa Reysol defeated Thai club Chonburi, which gives Japan a total of 4 clubs in the 2015 Champions League Group Stage.</p>

<p><strong>Relegation in J.League Division 1</strong></p>

<p>At the end of each season the bottom 3 clubs on the overall table are relegated to Division 2. In 2014 these clubs were Omiya Ardija, Cerezo Osaka, and Tokushima Vortis.</p>

<p><strong>Promotion in J.League Division 2</strong></p>

<p>The top two clubs in J2 are automatically promoted to J1 at the end of the season. The clubs that finished 3rd - 6th in the league participate in the &quot;Promotion Playoffs&quot;, a single elimination tournament with the winner receiving the final promotion spot. The tournament is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>3rd v 6th 
           &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2
4th v 5th
</code></pre>

<p>In 2014 the clubs that gained promotion from J2 were Shonan Bellmare, Matsumoto Yamaga, and Montedio Yamagata (the promotion playoffs winner). </p>

<p><strong>Relegation in J2 and Promotion in J3</strong></p>

<p>The bottom club in J2 is automatically relegated to the third division in exchange for the winner of J3.League. However, the second bottom club in J2 and Runner-Up of J3 play each other in a &#39;Promotion Playoff&#39;, a one-off match which determines if the J2 club remains in that division or gets relegated.</p>

<p><strong>Relegation in J3</strong></p>

<p>There will be no relegation from J3.League in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3><strong>J.League 100 Year Plan Status</strong></h3>

<p>The J.League 100 Year Plan Status is a status given to Japanese non-league clubs that have the intention of entering becoming a professional club and joining the professional leagues at some point in the future. This system allows the J.League to identify clubs in order to give them advice, resources, and to ease the transition into professionalism. </p>

<p>In order to achieve this status, clubs that apply must meet a number of criteria, which include:</p>

<p><sup>I have only included some of the criteria. There are more that I have not listed</sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football and exist in this status for no less than one year</li>
<li>Must employ at least four administrative employees, one of whom must have managerial position</li>
<li>Must have proper financial management and conduct annual tax audit</li>
<li>Home stadium must be located in the proposed hometown</li>
<li>Must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown</li>
<li>Must secure training facilities in hometown</li>
<li>Must currently play in Japan Football League (4th tier), Regional League, or Prefectural League</li>
<li>Must aim for eventual admission to J. League</li>
<li>Must have a working soccer school/youth system that exists for no less than one year</li>
</ul>

<p>To gain promotion to the J.League 3rd Division, clubs must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must hold a 100 Year Plan status</li>
<li>Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination</li>
<li>Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league</li>
<li>Must finish within top 4 of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders</li>
<li>Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000</li>
<li>Must have annual revenue of at least ¥150 million (~$1,250,000), and no excessive debt</li>
</ul>

<p>As of the submission of this post there are 6 clubs that hold 100 Year Plan Status.</p>

<h3><strong>Domestic Tournaments</strong></h3>

<p>Japan has three major tournaments that take place each season. I have listed them in order of importance.</p>

<p><strong>Emperor&#39;s Cup (Est. in 1921)</strong></p>

<p>The longest running soccer tournament in Japan, this Cup is contested over 7 Rounds and includes 88 clubs from across Japan. The winner of the cup gains entry into the AFC Champions League.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Emperor&#x27;s_Cup">Click here for information on last year&#39;s Emperor&#39;s Cup</a>, which Gamba Osaka won.</p>

<p><strong>J. League Cup (Est. in 1992)</strong></p>

<p>The J.League Cup (Yamazaki Nabisco Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the Japanese equivalent of the Football League Cup in England, though it is currently only contested between clubs in the first division. The winner of the Cup qualifies for the Suruga Bank Championship, an annual intercontinental match against the winner of the Copa Sudamericana.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Cup">Click here for details</a></p>

<p><strong>Japanese Super Cup (Est. in 1994)</strong></p>

<p>This Cup is a one-off match contested between the winner of the Emperor&#39;s Cup and the winner of J.League Division 1. It is played in February before the J.League begins.</p>

<p>This year the Cup was played between Emperor&#39;s Cup winner Gamba Osaka and J.League Division 1 runner-up Urawa Red Diamonds (due to Gamba being J.League Champions).</p>

<hr/>

<h3><strong>2015 J.League Opening Day</strong></h3>

<p><sup>Times are in EST</sup></p>

<p><sup>Matches occur on March 6th into March 7th</sup></p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a huge Messi fan. And I had a feeling that Messi would have an amazing season back in September. So I decided to spend some time on this, since I knew that a lot of people (like myself) would enjoy it. I used to post them for the Barça fans on <a href="/r/barca">/r/barca</a> but it just got so excessive that I had to make my own subreddit, called <a href="/r/D10S">/r/D10S</a>.</p>

<p>It was originally supposed to be for 2014-15 only, but then someone asked about World Cup matches so I included that, and then Copa América was coming up so I included that as well. There&#39;s like a 95% chance I&#39;ll continue doing it next season. But anyways. 626 gfycats in total.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I separated it into 6 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/D10S/comments/2vrv4l/all_clips_by_category/">categories</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Goals</p></li>
<li><p>Assists</p></li>
<li><p>Created chances (<em>quality ones</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Missed chances (<em>sitters, not 30-yard shots</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Defending</p></li>
<li><p>Other (<em>anything that didn&#39;t strictly fit an above category</em>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I separated it into different competitions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>La Liga - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/D10S/comments/2uu11r/la_liga_rounds_119/">rounds 1-19</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/D10S/comments/2uu145/la_liga_rounds_2038/">rounds 20-38</a></p></li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve found better ways/resources to make these, but for the sake of continuity I had to do it the same. You can see the difference between a clip like <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/HideousShadyEquestrian">this</a> and a clip like <a href="http://www.gfycat.com/PolishedShabbyAntarcticfurseal">this</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2wkjy4/ive_been_collecting_almost_all_of_messis_great/">Here is</a> the first version of this post from 5 months ago. It was received pretty well.</p>

<p>And in case you didn&#39;t see before, I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3ay13s/to_recognise_messis_28th_birthday_here_is_my_list/">a list</a> of Messi&#39;s top 28 career goals on <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> a month ago.</p>

<h2>I made a Chrome extension that lets you hover over the names of football players to get their full career information.</h2>

<div id="3g025k" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>About:</strong></p>

<p>Roughly 2 months ago I set out on a mission to improve the way football was consumed on the web, and so I built <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/player-card/cllhdcdfilnhgbhofmeihhgfgpgohebk">Player Card</a>. Player Card analyzes all the names on a website and highlights football players and leagues from across the world so when you hover over the highlighted name you&#39;ll be presented with a carefully designed pop-up box that provides information about that hovered item. </p>

<p>Here is an example: <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/3a558ed78acf75d64fd8becd2554b7b1.png">Juan Mata</a>.</p>

<p>The design of Player Card was very important to me, and I think it shows. I spent many hours trying to perfect the layout and make the user experience as good as it could possibly be. </p>

<p>Player Card has a database of over 55,000 footballers of which 1,000 are female athletes, as well as 30 leagues (top and lower tier) to ultimately make following football a lot easier. </p>

<p>Now you might be wondering:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With a database so large, surely my page load time gets affected...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it doesn&#39;t, in fact the extra load time is practically none existent. </p>

<p>Try it for yourself you like :).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<p>Player Card is still a new concept and therefore isn&#39;t very feature rich as of yet, but here are the core features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Players &amp; leagues get highlighted within tabs.</li>
<li>Search players &amp; leagues within the popup window.</li>
<li>Add, remove, and view RSS feeds.</li>
<li>All settings are synced between your sessions and browsers.</li>
<li>Take screenshots (that are automatically uploaded to imgur) and view Wikipedia articles seamlessly within your browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Player Card also offers a popup window that lets you search players and leagues in the database and create rss feeds (defaults are: The Guardian, and BBC). The interface looks something like <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/ffa4bfa6127cdebd60bf7f77bf364f13.png">this</a>. So no matter if you want learn more about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jfb2NWg.png">Olivier N&#39;Siabamfumu</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xUDNj6f.png">Neymar</a>, Player Card has you covered. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So, I&#39;d like to give a full overview of the extension so I figure I should also mention the cons. From a very biased standpoint, I&#39;d have to say that Player Card has very few cons, in fact, I can only think of one that is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Occasionally you&#39;ll find that footballers share the same name as others. Unfortunately, my extension isn&#39;t smart enough to know which footballer is being mentioned so if you are on <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> and someone mentions <code>Ronaldo</code> the popup box will show Brazilian Ronaldo, even though you were perhaps expecting <code>Cristiano Ronaldo</code>. To combat this the extension only triggers with full names, but sometimes footballers share the same full name as well, so just a warning I suppose. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Future Updates:</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, Player Card is a new concept and currently only has a few core features, but I do have many plans for updating the extension and making it better. For instance I&#39;d love for people to be able to search and hover over football clubs to find out about future and previous fixtures, squad overviews, position in table etc. I&#39;m also looking to add live scores and match results, so keep an eye out for those. </p>

<p>If you would like to have an active voice in how Player Card is improved and built upon, you can check out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayerCard">subreddit</a> where you can make posts and give feedback etc.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That&#39;s it from me. If you would like to, you can download Player Card <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/player-card/cllhdcdfilnhgbhofmeihhgfgpgohebk">here</a>. I&#39;ll answer any questions that you may have, but apart from that, thanks for reading :).</p>

<p>Edit: Gold!? For me? Wow thanks :)</p>

<p>Edit 2: Oh my! So much gold! Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Edit 3: I&#39;m slightly overwhelmed by all this feedback :). I&#39;ll try to fix as many bugs as I can within the next few days. Never expected such a great response!</p>

<div id="4mu8j2" class="mdwrapper">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As I have read the thread about the transfer rumor of Embolo joining RB Leipzig I was irritated another time regarding the strong hate against RB Leipzig. I have read the different explanations why Hoffenheim, Wolfsburg and Leverkusen are somehow more established because they weren&#39;t &quot;bought&quot; by a company which is shamelessly exploiting a football team and is hollowing out a whole city by blunt advertising and marketing.   </p>

<p>I was born near Koblenz (Rhineland-Palatinate) around the &quot;Wende&quot; and my father was a strong supporter of Borussia Dortmund, thus I have watched every game on television together with him and was (of course) mesmerized by the likes of Sammer, Koller, Rosicky, Ewerthon et al. and it was awesome to see Dortmund rising back to power under Jürgen Klopp. Honestly it wasn&#39;t about a rich history which brought me to Dortmund, because I didn&#39;t experience all the things which were done in the 50s, 60s, 70s or whatsoever. Lothar Emmerich, Manfred Burgsmüller etc. are football players I know (next to Frank Mill, Nobby Dickel and all the other club icons), but they didn&#39;t affect me in liking Dortmund nowadays. So probably I am functioning differently here, because Dortmund started to become my favorite club due to my father and only then I began to develop an emotional bond to Borussia Dortmund -- the past which is gone 30 years or more is not really interesting for me.  </p>

<p>So now I am sitting here in Leipzig, I have moved to this wonderful-vivid city and it honestly pains me to think about that this culturally rich area with so so many young, motivated inhabitants (I am not even expanding this to the whole &quot;East Germany&quot; area) and young families weren&#39;t able to enjoy first league football for the past 25 years. Even though the city is quite poor and money is certainly not growing on the trees here, I couldn&#39;t imagine a better place for a first league team in whole Germany (and yeah, I have come around quite a bit). And to read about &quot;everyone in Germany is hoping that RB Leipzig is dropping points&quot; or &quot;everyone in Germany now has an enemy in the Bundesliga&quot; is so fucking ridiculous that I barely can find proper words. Yeah, Red Bull has taken over a club and is pumping money in infrastructure, youth development, establishing a serious and professional football club in Leipzig. And yes, they are of course advertising their product quite shamelessly. But a) the vast majority in Leipzig couldn&#39;t care less about those circumstances, because there are going to see weekly matches against Bayern München, Borussia Dortmund, HSV, Gladbach etc. pp. in the Zentralstadion and b) the ultras in Leipzig are very well aware of the shamless product placement done by Red Bull and are trying to promote the city of Leipzig instead of &quot;Red Bull&quot; as the representation of the club. I would highly suggest anyone to read about the fan organisation &quot;Die Rasenballisten&quot; ( <a href="http://www.rasenballisten.de/">http://www.rasenballisten.de/</a> ; e.g. <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/rb-leipzig-seele-gesucht/9893978.html">http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/rb-leipzig-seele-gesucht/9893978.html</a> ), who are -- as stupid as the name RasenBallsport actually is -- trying to put RasenBallsport in the spotlight. It&#39;s funny as one of the chairman of &quot;Die Rasenballisten&quot; is a colleague of mine and he said that they were counting on a matchday how many times the people in the fan zone sang about &quot;Red Bull&quot;, &quot;Die Bullen&quot; (the bulls; a nickname which was introduced for the team by Red Bull) or about &quot;Rasenball&quot;. In the end over 90% of the songs contained something about &quot;Rasenball&quot; or only &quot;RB Leipzig&quot;, not mentioning the bulls or something like this. The fans are well aware of the product placement done by Red Bull. As my colleague said to me, they have to bite the bullet Red Bull to get first league football, but surely they are able to shape the atmosphere within the stadium respectively on the stands. The whole city is cheering because they are going to see first league football next year -- everyone is extremely humble about this &quot;present&quot; called first league football. I for one am very happy for all the football fans here and it&#39;s absurd that everyone else in Germany is painting the picture of those cocky, arrogant, noveau-riche football jerks who have risen to the top because of sheer money and are laughing down at everyone else in the second tier or on the smaller clubs. Believe me or not, the people here in Leipzig are still very well aware of the fact that they are not living in West Germany. The monthly glance on the paycheck is still a gentle reminder of the inequality between West and East Germany. For fucks sake, let them have first league football and enjoy themselves for some time. Being a Borussia Dortmund fan on my own, I am looking forward to next year to see some games in the Zentralstadion and hoping that Leipzig finishes above everyone else despite Borussia Dortmund. Cheers.</p>

<p>What&#39;s Wenger doing sending Walcott on that early?</p>

<p>Thing about Arsenal, they always try to walk it in.</p>

<p><strong>Ludicrous displays</strong> (draws or losses, with Walcott failing to score or assist) <strong>at night matches</strong> (kick-off 18:00 or later) <strong>when Wenger sent on Walcott early</strong> (before 75&#39;)</p>

<div class="md"><p>City did the right thing to start the game, by trying to build up slowly from the back and they did the try to exploit the Sane vs Trent Alexander-Arnold with early switched balls, however Lovren did a great job at covering that today. We started a bit too overzealous, but once we settled into the game our pressing was brilliant. Most importantly we cut off the passing lanes, and Firmino was the perfect example for this. He dropped on top of Fernandinho and cut him off from the defence beginning to make it difficult for City to play out from the back. </p>

<p>I believed that the game would be won in the midfield, and I was very impressed with Milner. In the league against City we had Chamberlain-Can-Wijnaldum, today we had Milner-Henderson-Chamberlain. We kept the same midfield system of one holding, whilst the other two shuttle and press. For his age, Milner was very impressive with his work rate and it played it’s part in the second and third goal. It worked very well for the first half, but with consistent pressure we didn’t have the legs  to keep up this tempo. The worrying thing for us is with the tired legs, we’re unable to do what a really great team would do and take a 10 minute period in possession to calm things down and get a bit of rest. It’s been a bit of a running theme, but we’re still a work in progress. </p>

<p>Some interesting weak points in how Pep set City up  the lack of a natural right winger caused Walker to play much higher, whilst this of course is why he used Laporte on the left to tuck in during these periods. However, this left Sane quite isolated against Trent who had a good game. If City were able to play a more overlapping fullback, I think they could have exposed Trent. </p>

<p>He got that from <a href="https://youtu.be/UnSILVWDKL8">One America News</a>, which is just pure nationalist propaganda. If you thought Fox news was bad, well. His fanbase loves it because he &quot;owned the lib snowflakes&quot; because people with a brain will be steaming out the ears at the idiocy, and it&#39;ll doubly cement their favor of him because it confirms their &quot;deep state&quot; conspiracies or whatever. Absolutely no shame in calling the elderly man&#39;s full name out either.</p>
