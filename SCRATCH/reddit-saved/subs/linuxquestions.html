<p>I&#39;m not talking about Firefox or VLC.  I&#39;m asking you what are the best apps (gui or tui) for the Linux home desktop user that took you years to find or realize you really needed. I&#39;m talking about finding leprechauns. I&#39;m talking about the diamond in the rough kind of stuff. What are some absolute Linux Gems that <em>aren&#39;t</em> found in your typical &quot;Top 20 Best Blah Blah Blah for Linux&quot; articles? CLI utilities are great, but Linux noobs might also read this post, so let&#39;s try to stick with GUI as much as possible. </p>
