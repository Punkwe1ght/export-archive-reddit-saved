<p>Conservatives on Reddit brag about <strong>pushing every local crime story to the top of targeted local subreddits</strong> but not their local ones (<strong>even though statistically they have more homicides and crime in their cities</strong> but those aren&#39;t their top posts every single day in their local subreddits) by brigading to &quot;control the narrative&quot; about &quot;liberal cities&quot; and &quot;blue states&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real value is getting into a thread early and establishing top voted posts and comments or downvoting them out of existence. They hope intertia continues the trend for them.</p>

<p>SeattleWA has one mentally ill man who makes literally dozens and dozens of alt accounts to post conservative talking points from and how he finds black women disgusting. I become aware of his accounts when he posts in TV subs I ban him from, and he always has user history in similar sets of subreddits across his accounts, SeattleWA being the most telling. He will use these accounts to talk with himself or dogpile a comment or thread.</p>

<p>They are right wing political activists actively working to discredit the progressive movement and democrats in general by ensuring San Francisco is painted as a failure in all contexts they can find. Basic political astroturfing. San Francisco is targeted because it is in California and Pelosi is from here. This work has been going on for decades.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One Texas conservative in <a href="/r/sanfrancisco">r/sanfrancisco</a> was 10 different accounts, all having a history of identical comments (some comments about living in Texas), sometimes pretending to be annoying woke strawman &quot;S J W&quot; saying there is no crime by blacks so that his own alts can reply with black crime talking points</p>

<p>One &quot;Californian&quot; who posted about every local crime story, even every whale death, also posted about how he lives in Vegas, grew up in Texas, and has proudly never been to California <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2147236-starter-packs">https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2147236-starter-packs</a></p>

<p>I find it funny the people who see themselves as &quot;traditionalist&quot; or &quot;conversationalist&quot; completely ignore how some of the founding fathers warned about political parties and their ability to divide the nation.</p>

<p>But the two party system was started to be formed in 1796 when Washington stepped down as you had the democratic-republican and the federalist parties. From their the two main parties, which have evolved from their initial meaning, was established somewhere in the 1830s...</p>

<p>Its weird that outside the cultural battles the same argument the founders had are still being had in that its a battle of federal powers and state rights...</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/politics/trump-pentagon-board-lewandowski-bossie/index.html">Trump Purged the Pentagon and replaced high ranking officials with campaign advisors.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-protests-washington-guard-military/2021/01/07/c5299b56-510e-11eb-b2e8-3339e73d9da2_story.html">The Pentagon placed tight limits on the D.C. National Guard AHEAD of pro-Trump protests this week</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dccouncil.us/dc-council-statement-on-the-department-of-defenses-denial-of-dcs-national-guard-deployment-request/">Department of Defense denied a request by Mayor Muriel Bowser to expand the responsibilities of the District of Columbia National Guard so that they would be authorized to protect and restore order at the Capitol Building. That request was denied.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-08/gop-state-lawmakers-joined-observed-dc-riot">Several GOP state lawmakers observed or joined assault on Capitol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1347279463088844800">There were military and LEO&#39;s that were involved in the riot, they were photographed with restraints and were reported as being very coordinated.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://people.com/politics/pro-trump-rioters-tear-down-american-flag-replace-with-trump-flag-at-u-s-capitol-building/">A US flag was taken down and replaced with a Trump Flag.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/noose-hung-outside-capitol/">A Noose was set up</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-supporter-arrested-at-capitol-had-11-molotov-cocktails-feds-2021-1">One of the Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol was carrying 11 Molotov cocktails and an assault rifle, prosecutors say</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/capitol-police-rejected-offers-of-help-failed-to-plan-for-violence-20210108-p56so0.html">Capitol police rejected offers of help, failed to plan for violence</a></li>
</ol>

<p>This attack was much more orchestrated than people seem to believe. There was, what I can only describe, as an undeniable attempt at a coup. You had GOP leaders IN the MOB, You had paramilitary ACTIVLY searching for hostages, AND You had police and DoD leadership that, at this point, can only be described as complicit.</p>

<p>They had everything set up and ready, a paramilitary force to capture and execute politicians, new trump loyalist to assume roles of power, the line of succession and the majority of the countries officials under one roof, and a very traceable list of enablers.</p>

<p>I truly do not want to imagine what would have happened had they found those who were hiding and barricading themselves from these terrorist.</p>

<p>The absolute saddest thing about this though? In a few months time this will be shoved under a rug so that &quot;The Republic doesn&#39;t look weak to the eyes of the world&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit: let&#39;s make something clear, all I&#39;m doing here is laying out known things that are relevant to or directly about the events that happened on January 6th. I&#39;m no genius, I&#39;m no investigator, this stuff is publicly available, these terrorists were openly plotting this on Parler and even here on reddit. The fact is that all the pieces of a Coup were on the board, at the bare minimum we need to stop being coy about this and call it what it was, an attempted coup, anything less will continue to put the US in even more danger from enemies both domestic and foreign. </p>

<p>TLDR: I saw chess pieces on the board, im going to call the game chess.</p>

<p>Edit 2: becouse somehow this is still getting blown up. Like I said in a different comment, I highly doubt trump is the mastermind behind this Coup attempt, HOWEVER, he undeniably fanned the flames, and he undeniably unleashed the mob. This next bit is about as far as I&#39;ll go becouse it is PURELY speculation and probably should be ignored, my bet, my speculation, is there was PROBABLY a coordinated effort at the hands of a few GOP officials along with some like minded businesses men in order to create an inviroment and situation where a coup was possible. THAT IS ALL SPECULATION THOUGH AND HAS NO GROUNDING IN REALITY AT THIS TIME.</p>

<button onclick="toggles(900)">View full post</button><div id="900" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>Ha, well done. Reminds me of this example of right wing philosophy:</p>

<p><strong>A Day in the Life of Joe Republican</strong></p>

<p>Joe gets up at 6 a.m. and fills his coffeepot with water to prepare his morning coffee. The water is clean and good because some tree-hugging liberal fought for minimum water-quality standards. With his first swallow of coffee, he takes his daily medication. His medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised. All but $10 of his medications are paid for by his employer&#39;s medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Joe gets it too. </p>

<p>He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Joe&#39;s bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry. In the morning shower, Joe reaches for his shampoo. His bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.</p>

<p>Joe begins his work day. He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. </p>

<p>Joes employer pays these standards because Joe&#39;s employer doesn&#39;t want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, he&#39;ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn&#39;t think he should lose his home because of his temporary misfortune. Its noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe&#39;s deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe&#39;s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and his below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.</p>

<p>Joe is home from work. He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive. His car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. His was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers&#39; Home Administration because bankers didn&#39;t want to make rural loans. The house didn&#39;t have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn&#39;t belong and demanded rural electrification.</p>

<p>He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn&#39;t mention that the beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day.</p>

<p>Joe agrees: &quot;We don&#39;t need those big-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I&#39;m a self-made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.&quot;</p>

<p>libertarian make believe land</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IT IS A FINE DAY in the Libertarian utopia. Archibald Elbert Winchell rose from his bed bleary eyed, but well rested and focused to meet the day. As he rose, his bed  servant, a lovely girl of thirteen whom he had contracted out from her mother, a mine worker, rushed to signal the other servants to begin the day. In truth he liked the girl, but he was contractually obligated to give her the lash if she was too slow about her business- and, after all, contracts were everything.</p>

<p>She returned with a small group of other contracted servants -calling them indentured was rather gauche, not to mention old fashioned- proceeded to wash him down and then dress him. After he was fully clothed he stepped out on his balcony and looked over his holdings.</p>

<p>When Archie was a young lad, in a time he barely remembered, men of means such as himself were encumbered by a thousand petty rules and regulations governing everything one could imagine. The government stole half of Archie’s father’s fortune, or so the old man claimed. When Archie went over the books, he found the old man had exaggerated, but even five percent of his income was a theft beyond belief. What cowards they must have been, to accept such a yoke.</p>

<p>Stretching on before him was a plantation of size and efficiency that would stun the old masters of the south:  coca plants for cocaine production and poppy fields stretched from horizon to horizon. Heroin and crack cocaine were Archie’s products. He’d doubled his profit margins in the last year by cutting his product. A few dozen people had died, he heard, but the motto of the new society was their guide: caveat emptor.</p>

<p>In that spirit, Archie waited patiently for his food tasted to sample each of his items. Archie had all of his food examined, and then tasted. He’s lost two servants this year to e-coli, another to metal shavings in the food, and a third to dysentery. A shipment of canned tuna had been improperly soldered with lead, but Archie caught it in time. As an informed buyer, he did what was appropriate when he purchased poisoned, contaminated, or otherwise inedible food: he took his business elsewhere.</p>

<p>There was much to do, but first, he had to review the fees and cut a check to the local police squad. There were three of them, and Archie made sure that he was a good patron, and so his boys would deal with any issues on his land discretely, and would turn a blind eye to his... excesses.</p>

<p>After a breakfast of steaky, fatty bacon, foie gras, horsemeat, a touch of shark fin soup and whale tartar, he rose for the day in earnest.</p>

<p>His automobile was one of the finest available, with a sixteen cylinder engine and open mufflers. To think, when he was a boy, the government told people what equipment to have in their vehicles! Why waste money on a seat belt when he had no intention of crashing?</p>

<p>With a handful of his own trustee guards, he first toured the plantation slowly, stopping to speak with the overseers one by one. The work was back breaking, and this year alone he’d lost six of his employees to accidents of various stripes. Most of them hadn’t chosen to purchase health insurance with Archie’s company scrip, even though his price was quite reasonable. The poor unfortunates often didn’t have enough legal tender or credit to pay the door fee at an emergency ward, but that was not Archie’s concern; no man had a right to healthcare, after all.</p>

<p>Outside his walled compound, Archie drove fast. Speed limits were a distant memory, and his contracted police ignored him no matter what he did. It was a short drive into town, to his office.</p>

<p>He spent the morning reviewing memoranda and reports from his mining operation. Archie ran a tight ship in his asbestos mines, increasing his margins by forgoing safety equipment and primarily hiring children, who were better suited to underground operations.</p>

<p>He had a dozen lawsuits from grieving mothers, but it was no matter- contracts were contracts and his were ironclad, even more so when reviews by Archie’s panel of employed judges; the contract forfeited the right to a state court in favor of individual arbitration.</p>

<p>Archie received the accounts, and visualizing the gold he was collecting (fiat currency was long abandoned, greenbacks were near worthless, and most trade took place in checks, IOUs, and company scrip) Archie loaded his pockets with some of his own scrip and a few gold coins, and went out on the town.</p>

<p>While strolling down the main avenue past the drug dealers, strip clubs, and brothels, he strolled into his favorite gun store to overlook the new wares. He had his eye on particular on a new rocket launcher. Such weapons were freely available to own, but only men of means such as himself could purchase them. It was for the best- not only did the old government perform a background check -something that mystified and horrified Archie- they let just anyone who passed one buy guns as they pleased. Foreigners, blacks, even women. Archie vividly remembered when the change came and the old government fell. His mother wept when she was forbidden her work as a physician and all her credit and bank accounts cancelled, but later on she grew happy and content.</p>

<p>Outside, a familiar pimp offered Archie the chance to peruse the new wares. None were to his liking, so he passed and willed away a few hours at a gladiatorial game; they used to call it “football” before the machetes were introduced. To Archie, it seemed like feet had little to nothing to do with the ball.</p>

<p>After some absinthe and laudanum, Archie met with a few similar men of means. It was time to settle down and he was in the market for a bride. The girls sad meekly while Archie and his negotiating partners dickered and haggled over them. The girls didn’t strike his fancy and the offers were poor -they all wanted stock in his drug trade- so he’d have to come back another day.</p>

<p>Near sunset, Archie returned home. There had been more injuries; a twelve year old runner mowed down by a tractor, a broken leg, and a knife fight arranged by two of the overseers who’d grown bored. He would fire them, of course. His friends in the police would deal with the troubles. The contracts left him no liabilities, but he was kind enough to see that the injured were transported to the edge of his land, where they would need to arrange further travel to the emergency wards themselves. Their chances were poor, but alas, Archie had no responsibility to them. To even contemplate it would be to submit himself to slavery!</p>

<p>After a lovely dinner of ostrich eggs and giraffe filet, he retired, calling his bed servant to join him. He was tired from the day and had no plans to make use of her talents, but he’d grown used to her presence. He could marry her if he chose, and was sure she’d be grateful, but marriage was for making contracts. It was understood that the girl and her successors would remain, discretely, and his new wife would say nothing or be cast out of his house without a penny. So it was.</p>

<p>Archie did not awake again until he felt thin legs straddling his waist and fire about his neck. A silk cord from one of his window treatments was wound around his neck, burning. The girl’s eyes met his and before his throat closed, he managed to gasp out, “Why?”</p>

<p>And she said, “I got a better offer.”</p>
