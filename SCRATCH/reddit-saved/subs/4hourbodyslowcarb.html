<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I&#39;m trying to find the best workout to accompany the slow carb diet. I&#39;ve had success with just the diet so far but I want to make sure I&#39;m doing the best workouts for the diet. So far I&#39;ve been running / walking for about 40 min 2-3 times per week, doing 75 kettlebell swings twice a week. </p>

<p>Has anyone done the &quot;just kettlebell&quot; workout Tim recommends which is 75 kettlebell swings twice per week. This is the minimum effective dose. Can anyone let me know how their results were or recommend a workout for me that won&#39;t stall my weight loss or cause extra stress. </p>

<p>Thank you! </p>
