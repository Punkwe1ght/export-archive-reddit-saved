<h2>Looking for games simulating civilization, ecosystems or evolution</h2>

I&#39;m looking for a game where I can build, interact or form nature/environments where life in the form of animals, humans or simply creatures will live, interact and evolve/grow.</p>

<p>Games related to this that I&#39;ve enjoyed: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ecosystem</li>
<li>WorldBox</li>
<li>Rimworld</li>
<li>Spore</li>
<li>Eco(Kinda related?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m currently leaning more towards something akin to Ecosystem where I don&#39;t have to actively take care of the creatures and can sit back and do something else like terraform in Ecosystems.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also into mecha so it doesn&#39;t have to entirely be &quot;life&quot; in the form of creatures but mechanoids are also good.</p>

<h2>Background games. Hours of play with light attention investment.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(197)">View full post</button><div id="197" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I am looking for is kinda weird, but it is to help me with my ADHD while watching tv.  I play exclusively on PC.</p>

<p>Games that have worked for me in the past.  Civ 5/6, Particle Fleet, Creeper World, Power Wash Simulator, Fallout Shelter (at least for the first few days of building the base), Viscera Clean Up Detail.</p>

<p>What would be optimal would be something that once you have become accustomed to the game, there is almost no reading.  Mouse only play would be optimal. Hours of replay or user made maps.  Must be single player so I can get distracted and no one else is dependent on me.  No intense focus levels, so one can play at their own pace.  Clear set goals (no just sandbox). Able to be played when muted for all sound.</p>

<p>I know this is a weird list of features, but I am a weird guy.  Games that do not work for one reason or another: Lawn Mower Simulator, Stardew Valley, RTS games.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>Any more games like Morrowind?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(199)">View full post</button><div id="199" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please  help me Redditfolks, I made the mistake of falling into the Bethesda  trap, I tried the game and now I&#39;m addicted, the fantasy landscape, the  open world freedom, the countless mechanics, the story related content  and quests, the ability to be anybody you want to be, lack of quest markers to let you make your own story... I already played for like 120  hours last week and I&#39;m addicted</p>

<p>Oblivion  and Skyrim have such insipid atmosphere to do the trick for me at all, Fallout overall is so depressing and the world is so sad to live in that I just can&#39;t get to it, The Witcher has you playing a premade character, Breath  of the Wild has very little RPG elements, please help me I need more first person  open world RPGs to sustain this addiction for escapism of mine, please  recommend me more games.</p>

<h2>Looking for recommendations outside of the most popular games in the world.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(274)">View full post</button><div id="274" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>So just high quality, underrated and less known games? I&#39;ll give you my favourites that fit this criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Pathless (amazing music, beautiful visuals, very unique and relaxing movement mechanics, light puzzles, some exploration, only 1 cinematically impressive and epic (but easy) boss fight in each biome and no normal combat outside of that, story told through ancient stone tablets and the last memories of corpses that you can hear)</p></li>
<li><p>Dust: An Elysian Tale (pretty cool 2D adventure game, don&#39;t remember many details as it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve played it, but I enjoyed it a lot!)</p></li>
<li><p>Everhood (Undertale-esque style, but very different &quot;combat&quot; which is best described as reverse guitar hero, gets very trippy and philosophical later on)</p></li>
<li><p>Cultist Simulator (the most abstract and bizarre game I have ever played, everything is shown in card form with timers and the ability to pause, no tutorial or explanations given, you just jump in blindly and try to figure out how it all works, the journey sure os weird, but hooked me)</p></li>
<li><p>Valley (fun little rather linear story teller with some cool platforming)</p></li>
<li><p>Inmost (fairly short, creepy 2D story game with light platforming, light puzzles and light combat. Amazing music and atmosphere, gorgeous pixel artstyle, ending was satisfying to me)</p></li>
<li><p>Never Alone (Very cool game about the Inuit culture, that&#39;s like half a documentary and half a game. I&#39;m usually not a documentary type of guy, but the way it was done really captured me.)</p></li>
<li><p>Darksiders Genesis (I know the Darksiders games are huge, but I found this was was often left out and forgotten, but imo the isometric camera worked well and the game was quite enjoyable, just pure action!)</p></li>
<li><p>Eastshade (a game about exploring a world and taking pictures of beautiful scenery)</p></li>
<li><p>Supraland (really cool 3D adventure game where you&#39;re a stick figure and the entire world is the size of a literal sand box, very fun to explore and travel through)</p></li>
<li><p>Rain World (reall  unique 2D survival platforming game, with an interesting and brutal world to explore and an actual food chain where you&#39;re at the lower end, trying to get by and survive by outsmarting stronger species and avoiding danger, super atmospheric visual and sound design)</p></li>
<li><p>The First Tree (short but sweet linear game where you&#39;re a fox looking for its cubs, you listen to the story through audio tapes and the world looks stunningly beautiful at times, with a touching ending)</p></li>
<li><p>The Beginner&#39;s Guide (lesser known game by the makers of Stanley&#39;s Parable, totally different but equally unique)</p></li>
<li><p>Rime (amazing adventure game with a cool world and puzzles and some action)</p></li>
<li><p>Fez (fun and unique little platformer and puzzle game that plays with perspective and the 3D vision)</p></li>
<li><p>Scanner Sombre (short but a very unique cave story , where you explore the cave and learn its history while being blind and only &quot;seeing&quot; your surroundings through echolocation)</p></li>
<li><p>Lost Ember (cool adventure game where play a spiritual fox that can take over the bodies of all the animals in the world, very enjoyable to travel and explore)</p></li>
<li><p>Indecision (very short but weird little 2D game)</p></li>
<li><p>Okami (3D adventure with a unique artstyle where you play a wolf, amazing music)</p></li>
<li><p>Reventure (funny 2D platformer with literally a hundred different endings to find)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think these are all lesser known or underrated games that are unique or fun in their own ways.</p>

<p>I recently started playing Risk of Rain 2 and have been enjoying that too.</p>

<p>Any recommendations that might fit in this list?</p>

<h2>Any 90s PC gaming hidden gems?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(406)">View full post</button><div id="406" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like I&#39;ve played all the big obvious 90s PC games (LucasArts, Sierra, Westwood, Origin, id Software, etc.) but would love to find some slightly lesser known games that did cool things. I have a preference for story based games, but something like Stunt Island would be a good example of a hidden gem.</p>

<p>EDIT: Fantastic suggestions here, and a great spread of genres. I already own many across my GOG and Steam accounts but this will help me prioritise. Thanks all.</p>
