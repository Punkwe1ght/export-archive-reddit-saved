<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a homebrewer, but I&#39;ve only done beers (and a few ciders), and I&#39;ve always been interested in distillation. Lo and behold, I find this fascinating sub-reddit. My question is, what are some of the acronyms used? I&#39;m seeing a lot of things like CFW, and so forth. What do these mean?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the clarifications.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have a 15.5 gallon stainless steel keg that I want to use for a still. I already have a 2 foot tall column (1&quot; copper pipe, packed with stainless steel mesh) that I built a while ago. I just need some way to attach the two. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ED2EZCK?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_2&amp;smid=A3T1FPHNVFB0WG">This</a> is the clamp I&#39;m going to to get, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ED2EZUW?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid=A3VHF8DJKCWZSU">this</a> is a gasket to go with it. My biggest concern is finding an adapter made of copper to fit the clamp. Not sure if I can buy a copper adapter peice, or will somehow have to roll the edge of a copper pipe myself. If I have to roll it myself, how do I do that? </p>

<p>Thanks for any insight you might have.</p>
