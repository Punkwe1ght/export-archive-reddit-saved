<p>I’ve been playing mostly with a lot of randomness but I’m finally starting to notice what kind of effects work for different weapons and aspects. </p>

<p>What type of combinations do you like to focus on, knowing that RNG is a big component and you can only control your run and boons to a small extent? </p>

<p>For instance, the shield isn’t a big damager so I have been trying to use Ares, Zeus, or Poseidon for packing on damage and effects, or using Aphrodite Special plus as many special bonuses as I can collect for a Stygius run to just wallop with power</p>

<h2>In-depth guide to pairing weapons and gods</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Dukaden </span><span class = "numcomments">56 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/j3l9v2/indepth_guide_to_pairing_weapons_and_gods/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(804)">View full post</button><div id="804" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>because i recently saw a chart attempting to illustrate who works well with that, and i found it irritating, misinformative, and extremely awkward to navigate, i decided to write this up for people who want to actually bother to read and understand the nuances of how/why things work together. this will take into account all attacks of the weapon, as well as aspects. feel free to ask questions, im more than willing to expand on any points.</p>

<p>but first, some gods and their numbers. i&#39;ll be drawing from epic levels of power for numbers, instead of common or otherwise. </p>

<p>aphrodite: attack 90-100%, special 144-160%.</p>

<p>athena/demeter: attack 72-80%, special 108-120%. </p>

<p>poseidon: attack 54-60%, special 126-140%</p>

<p>artemis: attack 36-40%, special 72-80% (crits are a bit of a wildcard for damage calculations though, but can basically be simplified as 20% crit being an additional 40% increase, or 15% being a 30% increase)</p>

<p>boon damage gods:</p>

<p>zeus: attack 15, special 40</p>

<p>ares: attack 100, special 100 (although other rarities have slightly different amounts)</p>

<p>dionysus: attack 6, special 7</p>

<h1>1) sword</h1>

<p>the first 3 aspects of the sword all function pretty much the same. poseidon aspect amplifies cast damage no matter what you choose, but the &quot;dislodge&quot; effect helps casts that aren&#39;t deme, ares, or dio. the sword has pretty average-fast stats and abilities. you can make pretty much every god work due to the numbers and style. the attack is quick, but the special is a little slow. </p>

<p>sword attack: pretty much any %damage god works. you can see the order of who does what amount of damage increase above, and zeus equates to poseidon for attack damage increase, both dealing ~40damage per attack. nothing wrong with taking dio, he&#39;s pretty easy to maintain max stacks. taking ares is fine too, and even taking dire misfortune (reapplying doom before it pops adds damage) can yield light results. </p>

<p>sword special: again, any %damage god boon can work just fine, but aphrodite stands out here due to attack rotation and time investment. generally you want to slip specials in now and again to animation cancel and maintain dps, especially using nemesis aspect to keep up the crit passive. having the highest damage boost and a need to slowly reapply weak every 3 seconds, aphrodite makes pressing special actually worth it, as opposed to some other gods that really would only offer damage out of it, like athena or artemis. i would not recommend demeter because stacking up 10 stacks would be kind of slow and difficult to maintain. ares can work fine, zeus can work fine (but his base damage equates to artemis without the crit), and i would not recommend dio because even only spamming special will barely maintain stacks of poison and you&#39;ll lose dps doing that. </p>

<p>arthur: bigger numbers, slower hits. stacking boons are less impactful due to the slower speed and their numbers balanced around the low attack damage of regular weapons. % increases shine with arthur. avoid zeus, ares, dio, prioritize aphro/artemis. </p>

<h1>2) spear</h1>

<p>about the same damage as the sword, just about the same speed too, maybe slightly slower. dash attacks are just as fast, although unlike the sword&#39;s dash of 30, the spear&#39;s is 20 (how does that make sense? lol. compensation for range i guess). the charge attack being a thing favors % damage gods more than boon damage gods, although regular/dash attacks can make boon damage gods work just fine. special hitting twice makes boon damage gods a bit more viable than the sword, but still woefully underperforming dps that way (except ares, he&#39;s fine even without dire misfortune)</p>

<p>spear attack: as mentioned, % damage gods work just fine, as well as boon damage gods. stacks are easy to build and maintain</p>

<p>spear special: due to the slowish nature of the special, aphrodite once again shines with her high numbers and minimal need for reapplication. ares is fine, especially with impending doom (doom does more damage after waiting longer to pop). nothing to really note here.</p>

<p>guan yu: aphro, artemis, and athena are the best, avoid boon damage gods. aphro/artemis for the damage, athena for the giant circle of deflection. </p>

<h1>3) shield</h1>

<p>the shield&#39;s attack is a little slower than the other weapons and only does 20 damage. the special only does 15. you&#39;re going to rely on blocking and bullrushing a lot, especially if you are using the chaos aspect. additionally, spamming dash attacks will compensate for the slow regular attack speed. due to the lower base damage, boons damage gods generally perform better than % damage gods. </p>

<p>shield attack: while you might think &quot;if im spamming recklessly, then thats good for boon damage gods, right?&quot; well you&#39;d only be partly right. theres a sort of gap in dps for heavier hitting weapons with % modifiers over boon damage. while zeus might give 14 damage, which is 34 for an attack, aphrodite can still put you at 40. however, bullrush can charge up to 40 base damage, which can give % damage gods a bigger edge. special shout out to athena attack for making bullrush deflect in addition to blocking, especially since that act of charging through enemies puts you close and triggers their &quot;oh he&#39;s in range, i should attack now&quot; AI so you can sometimes get bonus damage out of your rush by deflecting attacks or projectiles. boon damage gods are good for the shield though, especially ares/dio because they do their damage after you hit, so they can lend to safer hit and run styles. </p>

<p>shield special: boon damage gods all the way. the base damage is so low that competing with boon damage&#39;s base numbers is next to impossible. special exception: poseidon on special if you&#39;re using the chaos shield and get the seastorm duo. </p>

<p>beowulf: this is the cast option</p>

<h1>4) bow</h1>

<p>first off, i hate the bow. apologies if my experience skews my assessment. slow attack, big base damage. small damage rapidfire special. you should see this assessment coming</p>

<p>bow attack: % damage boons, artemis gets a chance to shine. avoid boon damage, except MAYBE ares. </p>

<p>bow special: boon damage can shine here, but % damage is nothing to scoff at. obviously its pretty bad with the zagreus aspect, but the chiron aspect makes both work pretty well. dio can actually underperform a little bit here because you can apply stacks faster than you need to by a LOT. aphrodite and artemis can put in work, zeus (or poseidon with sea storm) can do silly amounts of damage, ares can stack dire misfortune pretty well. </p>

<p>edit: as some have mentioned, shoutout to demeter on chiron special with arctic blast (140 pop at 10 stacks of chill). with both boons epic, thats a 294 damage burst.</p>

<p>rama: honestly havent gotten a chance to use it yet, though i suspect is favors % damage boons on attack and debuffs/stacks on special.</p>

<h1>5) fists</h1>

<p>the fists attack very quickly. you might think &quot;this will be good for dio, right?&quot; not really. dio is actually mediocre for the fists and rail because they attack TOO fast. sure, you can maintain max stacks all day, but you&#39;re attacking so fast without any sort of bonus to those attacks during max stacks that you&#39;re actually losing out on dps compared to taking it on another weapon. sure that 60dps might be comparable or better than % damage boons, but thats just the nature of these low damage weapons</p>

<p>fist attack: zeus can finally shine just as strong as aphrodite. shout out to poseidon on attack with seastorm duo. ares can get good value out of dire misfortune stacks (basically putting him equal to zeus, plus 100). constant attacking can make athena good for deflects, but you&#39;ll probably want to find damage elsewhere. demeter with arctic blast can be decent, but some people prefer to maintain max stacks of chill for easier boss fights. just about anything works, but boon damage shines a little more than usual.</p>

<p>fist special: just about anything can work. boon damage can work due to it hitting twice, and aspect of demeter makes them work even more. </p>

<p>gilgamesh: havent gotten to use it yet</p>

<h1>6) rail</h1>

<p>the rail is rapid fire, low damage, with a slow, high damage special. this favors boon damage on attack, and % damage on special. exception to this is hestia aspect, which wants % damage, especially artemis for big dick crits.</p>

<p>rail attack: base damage is 10. zeus offers 14. you just increased your attack damage by 240%. again, poseidon with seastorm adding 40 damage lightnings per bullet is kind of silly (i&#39;d recommend zeus&#39;s cast or dash instead of special or call though). you can get value out of ares&#39;s dire misfortune here too. for % gods, take the number in the 10s place (and higher when applicable), and thats how much damage you increase per bullet. 70%? +7 damage. simple. not really that great. much like the fists, dio gets kind of wasted here because you attack TOO fast and are hitting at max stacks without any sort of value for it, but he&#39;s still a better pick than the % gods, unless you&#39;re really looking for a specific synergy/duo. again, demeter and arctic blast do well due to the speed.</p>

<p>rail special: special shoutout to the triple and/or cluster rocket hammer options, and making artemis on special playable with your eyes closed. % damage all the way, boon damage is wasted. its too slow and the increase in damage from %s is too high. while ares technically does competitive damage on special here, there are a number of factors through hammers and chaos that make % damage more appealing.</p>

<p>lucifer: didnt much care for this aspect, but the assessment doesnt change. </p>

<h1>takeaways</h1>

<p>1) there is a clear divide between boon damage and % damage. for dio you want to attack fast enough to maintain stacks, but not too fast to lose value. around 6 attacks every 4 seconds does it, and the rail/fists go far over that. however, if you want to take playstyle into account, dio does work as a &quot;hit and run&quot; style since you simple attack, and run away while it does damage. </p>

<p>1 b) for dio you want to attack fast enough to maintain stacks, but not too fast to lose value. around 6 attacks every 4 seconds does it, and the rail/fists go far over that. however, if you want to take playstyle into account, dio does work as a &quot;hit and run&quot; style since you simple attack, and run away while it does damage. dio at max stacks is 6x5x2, for 60 dps. while 60 dps (on top of your basic attack dps, whatever that may be for your weapon and playstyle) can be good, there are other ways to have higher dps and better synergies with those fast weapons. i&#39;ll grant that its better than % damage boons in the raw, but you&#39;re still wasting potential by choosing him on the rail/fists instead of other weapons.</p>

<p>2) poseidon can be considered in place of boon damage if you shoot for sea storm.</p>

<p>3) while athena, poseidon, demeter, and artemis are basically inferior to aphrodite in raw numbers, you have to consider what else they DO and how that factors into your playstyle and what sort of duos you might be aiming for. </p>

<p>4) ares doesnt need dire misfortune to be good, but fast attacking weapons utilizing it makes him better. he can work on slow hits just fine due to the delay nature of doom and impending doom. ares outclasses dio, and stays on top easier, as long as you can reapply doom in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>4 b) something to note: ares attack is good on anything, and usually actually better dps on basic attack than even aphrodite. i think the only instances where aphrodite (or artemis) comes out on top is with arthur and hestia aspects, and maybe the spear spin attack. ares special is good on just about anything because nothing really comes close to being able to deal more damage by hitting multiple times within the window of the doom, unless they have specific hammer upgrades (like the triple or rockets for the rail). the only other times %boons actually out perform him are after multiple things synergizing together (extra bonus backstab damage and all that)</p>

<p>4 c) this ares stuff is also pretty much solely on the damage provided from the doom compared to the bonus damage you get from %boons. a base attack of 25, with aphrodite would be 50, would have to hit 4 times to match the damage of the same attack with 4 times with a single doom. 4x50=200. 4x25=100, +100 doom =200. factoring in impending doom, which is a whopping +72%, lets add 2 attacks during the increased window and say doom version is a total of 6x25=150, +172 doom = 322. 6x50=300 for aphro. all hypothetical of course. additionally, ares gets to split poms between the two boons, while % damage things are stuck with just the one thing to boost. ares is a beast. now, i mention above about dire misfortune making ares better with fast weapons, but with all of this math he stands head and shoulders way above % damage choices for the fast weapons and their puny base numbers. apparently i was &quot;downplaying&quot; this before, so heres the exalted version. </p>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>sword) attack: anything works, knock yourself out. special: anything works except dio, % damage slightly favored.</p>

<p>spear) attack: anything works, knock yourself out. special: anything except dio works. </p>

<p>shield) attack: anything works, boon damage does better than the previous 2 in comparison. special: boon damage all the way.</p>

<p>bow) attack: % damage all the way, MAYBE throw ares on if you feel like it due to some duo digging necessity. special) anything works, boon damage shines, dio underperforms.</p>

<p>fists) attack: anything works, but boon damage does great due to the speed. special: anything works, especially with demeter aspect</p>

<p>rail) attack: boon damage, avoid % damage unless you need a certain effect or duo to show up. hestia aspect actually uses % damage though. special: % damage all the way, ares is acceptable due to the slow nature though. avoid other boon damage.</p>

<h2>High-Heat Players: Any Tips on Progressing?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(818)">View full post</button><div id="818" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve completed Heat 6 on fists, but struggling with some other weapons; I&#39;m curious about a few specific things, but also any more general thoughts on how your playstyle and decision-making changes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are there particular Boons that increasingly stand out as must-have?  (For example, to date I&#39;ve found Divine Dash and Crystal Beam are very hard pass up - Beam just seems an easy way to dish out sustained DPS with little risk, while Divine Dash saves enormous amounts of incoming damage and stuns while also doing damage in return... most other dash options feel weak by comparison).</p></li>
<li><p>What Pact conditions are easiest / hardest?  I&#39;ve been using stuff like more mobs / more mob health / the blue damage shield / extreme boss modifier... I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about less health / more expensive shops / losing Boons / losing Boon choices.</p></li>
<li><p>What sort of Keepsake / Companion choices make sense?</p></li>
<li><p>Do the Infernal Gates have much relevance?  I&#39;ve taken a few but you just seem to get some decent Boon choices so long as you don&#39;t get hit... felt underwhelmed so far.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I found playing games like Slay the Spire, there was a really interesting change as you went from base game to Ascension... I learned to hunt Elites instead of ducking them, and to be more savvy about what possible enemies were ahead.  So I&#39;m assuming the same here; ie. need to be tight in planning and thinking about the map?</p>

<h2>Anyone else find that rerolling stuff does mostly nothing?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(839)">View full post</button><div id="839" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>I only used Fated Persuasion rerolls for a little bit after their initial release and found they often rerolled into the same boons or worse, so I never used it afterwards. But I know quite a bit about Fated Authority rerolls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t reroll blue laurel rewards (nectar/gem/darkness/key), they can only be rerolled into each other. </li>
<li>If you reroll a door, you can never get what was originally on that door on that same door. So if you, say rerolled a pom and got obols you will never be able to get pom on this door. </li>
<li>Outside of the original reward, the rewards can repeat themselves, so say, obols-&gt;pom-&gt;heart-&gt;pom is possible. </li>
<li>You can&#39;t get two doors to have the same reward at the same time, but otherwise they don&#39;t affect each other, so if you rerolled one door you can still get it&#39;s original reward on the other door(which is why you generally should only reroll one of the doors, unless in Styx).</li>
<li>This is more anecdotal, but I found that pom/heart/obol/hammer/hermes boons usually reroll into each other and &quot;regular&quot; god boons usually reroll into another &quot;regular&quot; god boon, unless you have a deficit of one or the other, so trying to turn a pom/heart/obol into a god boon is often(but not always) is a waste of rerolls. A big exception to that rule of thumb is rerolling Styx and Erebus gates rewards, those can go either way.</li>
<li>If you missed a hammer in Tartarus, rerolling the first golden laurel reward in Asphodel will usually result in a hammer.</li>
<li>Miniboss encounters never get rerolled into regular rooms and vice versa. Outside of Styx, they can only give you an increased rarity boon, so you will always reroll into a different god.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, rerolls can be used: to increase the odds of getting a certain god (but sometimes the RNG is merciless and you don&#39;t get what you want), to focus one of the trio of hearts/poms/obols (as they often reroll into each other, and you can only get a limited amount of hermes boons and hammers), and to sometimes increase your overall amount of boons at the expense of hearts/poms/obols (anecdotally, it&#39;s not very effective overall, but pretty effective in Styx, and on Erebus gate rewards)</p>

<h2>Hades Save Manager v1.0 - Create and load snapshots throughout a run</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/Museus </span><span class = "numcomments">12 comments </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/id2a61/hades_save_manager_v10_create_and_load_snapshots/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(840)">View full post</button><div id="840" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here is an external tool (not a mod) that allows you to create and load snapshots for Hades. This has a two main uses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Routing runs: By replaying the same room and doing different things after picking up a boon, you  can modify the seed for the next room. This will result in different boons, different enemies, different reward for the room after, etc. Doing the same thing will net you the same results every time (barring weird interactions with pots/voicelines/gold pickups) which allows you to create a predetermined route through the entire run, from start to finish. To see an example of this, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leyVtEnXowk">Vorime&#39;s 3:59 IGT run from Nighty Night</a>.</li>
<li>Practicing: This is the one that will be most helpful to the average player. Having trouble with a boss, or miniboss? Have a room full of enemies you want to practice on? When you walk into the chamber, just create a snapshot, and reload it as many times as you need.</li>
</ul>

<p>The save manager a portable executable, which means it can be run without installing on your PC. It does, however, required the .NET framework. If you do not have .NET installed, the save manager will prompt you when you run it for the first time.</p>

<p>Click <a href="https://github.com/museus/hadessavemanager">here</a> for the code. If you don&#39;t care about the code, click <a href="https://github.com/Museus/HadesSaveManager/releases/tag/v1.0">here</a> to get to the Releases, and then download the file labeled &quot;HadesSaveManager.v1.0.zip&quot;. Just extract the folder to any location (your Desktop works fine) and then run the &quot;HadesSaveManager.exe&quot; file inside.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on how to use the Save Manager, <a href="https://github.com/Museus/HadesSaveManager/blob/v1.0/README.md">here is the README</a>.</p>

<h2>Boon Progression</h2>
<span class = "user">posted by: u/jjaekkak </span><span class = "numcomments">13 comments </span><a href="/r/HadesTheGame/comments/i7p6zb/boon_progression/g13pyj1/" target="_blank">(source)</a>
<button onclick="toggles(851)">View full post</button><div id="851" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>It’s a bit free formed as you find out stuff through trial and error. Some boons are more versatile than others and sometimes a boon requires more commitment on a given weapon. I’m gonna focus primarily on Strike and Flourish boons.</p>

<p>A really big thing to keep in mind is “does the weapon attack or special hit a lot with low base damage or hit on a slower cadence with heavy damage? Another more mild bit is how the dash strike works for the weapon.</p>

<p>Dionysus, Zeus, and Demeter boons are great for things that hit rapidly because chill stacks to 10 and hangover stacks to 5, and Zeus strike/flourish just deals base damage on every hit.</p>

<p>Poseidon, Aphrodite, and Artemis <em>tend</em> to be a bit better on slower cadence. The Weak effect doesn’t stack, knockback can disrupt your own combos, and both Poseidon and Aphrodite have high %damage increases. Artemis has the weakest percent increase but crit damage is insane in this game so her slight percent increase plus a chance to do +250% damage (or whatever, it’s been awhile) is huge.</p>

<p>Athena, Ares, and honestly also Poseidon can be a bit more involved. Ares doom effect by default doesn’t benefit from additional hits but tagging a ton of people at once with it is great. Athena has a good % damage increase but the deflect makes it good for wide spread attacks too. If you can reliably wall slam, Poseidon is really powerful on fast attacks as long as it doesn’t disrupt your flow.</p>

<p>To touch on dash boons briefly, the main outliers in this decision come from A) hunting for certain duos, or B) maintaining a status curse to abuse privileged status. Athena’s dash is absolutely always top tier. It makes your defensive tool far more effective at what it does, AND with another boon it can apply a status curse with a decent duration. Artemis’ Dash is amazing on niche things like bow builds that depend on power shot; dash strike cuts down the powershot time by a lot while sacrificing some damage, and the boon compensates to make dash strike as effective or more effective than a stationary shot. We don’t hate Ares dash but the fact that it doesn’t satisfy requirements for his blade rift boons on its own or work with the homing duo makes it a bit meh.</p>

<p>Speaking of duos... Poseidon x Zeus makes it so really you can just have Zeus on your Call and dish out towns of jolting doom with a rapid hitting Poseidon boon. Zeus x Demeter makes it so through jolt and privileged status you can benefit from an occasional Zeus zap while focusing on Demeter attacks. Ares is complicated as hell because Doom can be made to stack and/or delay for more damage, which makes either fast or slow attacks pretty damn good. His Aphrodite Duo works particularly well with stacking a rapid hit, but his Athena duo benefits from tightly weaving together deflects and dooms.</p>

<p>This general way of thinking about boons on weapon attacks has served me pretty well. Some other noteworthy things include Athena flourish on the rail’s hidden aspect. The deflect Aoe is much bigger than you can possibly imagine, eliminating all traces of a bullet hell. Poseidon dash is an absolute trap on most twin fist builds, don’t do it. Blizzard Shot and Demeter cast are both really weird on Hera Bow. Last I checked Ares cast is pretty terrible on hidden shield aspect. Aphrodite dash is pretty terrible unless you plan on melee dash striking a lot, and even then the juice isn’t worth the squeeze.</p>

<p>Edit: hangover typo.</p>

<h2>How do I beat the final boss?!?</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(856)">View full post</button><div id="856" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Admittedly, I&#39;m getting frustrated with this game, and yet want to beat it so bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on run #28. For like the last 6 runs I can now get through to Hades every time with at least two defiance lives left. But I can&#39;t beat him. I&#39;ve tried a few different approaches and seem to get furthest with either the shield or gloves.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? I&#39;ve upgraded a ton in the mirror (though I still need 30 keys to unlock the last section), and I blew most of my titans blood upgrading the shield to the Zeus version (not sure that&#39;s helping). I&#39;ve unlocked all of the keepsakes (though the locked boxes underneath them are all still locked), and tried running with the broken spear point too.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve finally turned on God Mode since I&#39;m getting frustrated, though I guess that&#39;s going to take a while to build up.</p>

<p>How do you beat Hades? Who&#39;s boons should I be focusing on as I run through the levels? Which mirror options help the most? Which keepsakes work best?</p>

<p>Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>

<p>EDIT!!!!!! I did it! It took me ONE MORE RUN! Seriously!! Couldn&#39;t believe it! Thank you everyone for the advice!</p>

Been playing Hades for about a week and started clearing runs a few days ago. Been more or less playing blind to experience the game and have fun with it, but now trying to get better as I’m increasing the heat!</p>

<p>So I’m wondering what are some invaluable tips and strategies? Generally been doing alright with simple synergies like pairing doom with single hit/aoe and hangover with multihits etc. But what are other good strategies to try?</p>

<button onclick="toggles(858)">View full post</button><div id="858" class="mdwrapper"><div class="md"><p>After 100 wins in, I&#39;d say really focus on your overall build, and how to stay flexible each run. Here&#39;s some tips that helped me:</p>

<p>-try and build around 2 different status effects for the privileged status mirror trait. Typically 1 on attack, 1 on special or cast for quickly putting it on enemies</p>

<p>-always take hermes extra dashes or athena dash reflect. Even if its common its a huge boost</p>

<p>-try not to focus on more than 2 gods. Better to invest &amp; get higher tier boons</p>

<p>-know how to properly use the fated authority rerolls. There&#39;s 2 pools of items. Rule of thumb is to never reroll meta-game stuff (gems, darkness, nectar). I usually reroll centaur hearts and gold, in hopes of boons. Don&#39;t reroll the same thing more than twice</p>

<p>-avoid shops early game unless you&#39;re really hurting for health. It&#39;s better to get an extra room&#39;s reward.</p>

<p>-understand which keepsakes to use in each world. Typically i start with the cthonic coin purse in tartarus. Asphodel i pick whichever god&#39;s boon im getting the most. Elysium same thing unless you&#39;re really hurting, then go for a damage/defence keepsake. Styx either broken spearpoint or evergreen acorn. If you have companions, bouldy is the best.</p>

<p>Otherwise make sure you have good mirror traits. I highly recommend dark regeneration, ruthless reflex, privileged status, and fated authority.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
