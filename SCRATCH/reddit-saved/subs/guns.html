<div class="md"><p>I bought the 30-06 Savage Axis II.  I really like the gun, accutrigger is great.  For it&#39;s price you get a lot of bang for your buck.  The one issue I had was with the scope rings.  The rings that it came with didn&#39;t bite onto the base all of the way.  The scope would wobble or even come off (really pissed me off).  But I bought some Burris rings that bit the base properly and haven&#39;t had any other issues with it.  </p>
