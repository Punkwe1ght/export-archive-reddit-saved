<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you use the Harvest Arrow (Sharpshooter bow Very rare) to shoot off components that yield materials like Blaze you get a busload of them, for example if you shoot the canister from a grazer you gain 6 blaze from 1 canister so that makes 6*4=24 blaze from one Grazer.</p>

<p>You can do this after the Machine is dead so you can take your time. Do not loot it before you are finished with it or you won&#39;t be able to do that because the normal material count will be lootet and the components are gone.</p>

<p>A thunder jaw drops around 54 Blaze and 54 Chillwater.</p>

<p>Happy hunting and looting. </p>

<p>Ah and make sure you do not the destroy the components during the fight or they are simply gone.</p>

- grab the free sample boxes from vendors. </p>

<ul>
<li>in the options you could turn on tap once to run, instead of hold</li>
</ul>

<p>-when doing weapon tutorial quests you must have the quest active. </p>

<p>-roll to remove fire</p>

<p>-use photo mode </p>

<p>-Always tag enemies using focus so that their weaknesses will be highlighted without focus on.</p>

<p>-a soft touch of touchpad and it&#39;ll bring up your hud</p>

<p>-You can stow your weapon immediately by pulling up the weapon wheel and pressing R3</p>

<p>-whistle and throw rocks are great skills to have first, makes stealth from grass very easy. </p>

<p>-Crafting always uses up the full range of materials, even when creating less then the standard package. So only craft if you can add a full package (ie 10 arrows) to save stuff</p>

<p>-if your getting killed while crafting ammo during combat, go into the main menu for a full game pause </p>

<p>-Press square again while sliding to cancel your slide. You can buffer a crouch at any time during your roll. Unknock your arrow by letting go of L2 or rolling. Unlock the Tinkerer skill fast so you can save/sell your mods(also pulling back on L3 ends slide early)</p>

<p>-Always kill boars, turkeys, rabbits etc when you see them. They are your potions and travel packs. Also buy wire any chance you get, you need it for several things and it is semi-rare</p>

<p>-Full speed crouch walking and crouch rolling make the same level of noise but rolling is much faster if you need to sneak from cover to cover quickly</p>

<p>-Constantly jump up and down with a bow during fights to cheese the game and have infinite slow motion</p>

<p>-Go back through the ruins in the embrace as an adult for lots of extra resources. Also there is a quest item there for the best armor in the game. </p>

<p>-Kill wildlife animals as soon as you see them , you need their fat / bones for upgrades</p>

<p>-The merchant at the main Embrace Gate sells four maps which mark the spots of vantages, metal flowers, figures and cauldrons on the main map.</p>

<p>-You can change your languages from the settings menu in the main menu. This is not available while in-game, just from the main menu.</p>

<p>-You can save scum treasure boxes. The contents are randomized when the area (not the game!) loads.</p>

<p>-Â Buy the Golden Fast Travel Pack. 50 metal, 1 fox skin, and 10 fatty meat for unlimited traveling. Very helpful in the long run.</p>

<p>-on your PS4 when using photo mode change to easy screenshots for one tap screenshots </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I did a search and didn&#39;t find anyone else talking about this (if it&#39;s a repost, I&#39;ll take it down, no problemo).</p>

<p>I was exploring the starting area and on the far West side there is a Scrapper site with 4 lvl 8 scrappers and 2 loot piles that have had at least 1 purple mod every time I&#39;ve gone back to it. You can run to the campfire, quicksave, and it respawns too so you can farm away.  </p>

<p>I got a 41% damage mod out of it and decided to try farming it.  I have a buddy who&#39;s pretty high level now and he said the purples he&#39;s getting now are also in the 40% range (but with secondary stats sometimes) so these seem like they&#39;ll be worth getting early!  I made a video if you prefer it too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugOFNNQuAA4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugOFNNQuAA4</a></p>

<p>*Edit - I just saw that the trader in Mother&#39;s Heart sells a &quot;Special Modification Box&quot; for 1350 shards too, holy crap that&#39;s expensive, this method will save you a ton of shards too if you were thinking about buying that!</p>

<p>Fast travel back to the gate got you down because the door is closed?</p>

<p>Worry no more!</p>

<p>Standing outside of the closed gate - you will notice a set up Woden spikes used as a defense. There is a break in the spike which allows you to get closer to the wall. You can jump up on the spikes and slowly hop towards the entry gate. It may take a few attempts but there is a pole located in the right spot you should be able to get over the gate and back into the mountain. Just figured it out and haven&#39;t heard about it.</p>

<p>Give it a shot for yourself. Took two tries but it worked. It was out of pure frustration that I even attempted it.</p>

Holding a machine like a Stormbird or Thunderjaw on the ground so you can freeze it with your sling and then pepper it with sticky bombs from your blast sling is an incredibly effective strategy. The detonation wire on the tripcaster can do beyond incredible damage with the right mods, though I don&#39;t use it as much. I have never and will never use the rattler. Stack damage mods in the blast sling, and handling mods in the ropecaster for maximum effect.</p>

<p><strong>Tallnecks:</strong></p>

<p>Should be located on world map. 5 in total</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hunting Grounds:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Nora Hunting Grounds:</em></p>

<p>Parts Alone Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove Canisters from Grazers</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended to use arrows that have a higher tear stat to be able to remove components from machines (precision arrows or tearblast arrows for example)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Logpile Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kill machines using the Logpile Traps in the area.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easier to shoot a blast sling away from the Grazers, they should start running towards the logpile, once they get close shoot the logpile</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Blast Wire Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kill Grazers using the Carja Tripcaster</p></li>
<li><p>Same as the previous trial, but instead set several traps on the path, they will all run right into them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valleymeet Hunting Grounds:</p>

<p>Fire Fight Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shoot Strider Canisters using Fire Arrows</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of obvious, shoot the cannisters on the backs of striders with fire arrows quickly</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Shock Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stun Bellowbacks and Shoot Canisters off the Undersides</p></li>
<li><p>To do this quickly, use stun bombs from the sling, and use the tearblast arrows on their underside to quickly remove the strapping and the cannisters off their underside</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Freeze Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kill Machines while Frozen</p></li>
<li><p>You have the option to use Ice bombs from your sling, or use ice arrows from the war bow.  Just kill them while they are under the effect of frost.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Greatrun Hunting Grounds:</em></p>

<p>Parts Wrangling Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tie down Ttramplers using the Ropecaster</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously, use the Ropecaster to tie down tramplers</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pace Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Race Glinthawks to Watcher corpses</p></li>
<li><p>This is just a race, I would recommend using the furthermost left zipline down to start the race</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tie Down Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tie Down Glinthawks using the ropecaster</p></li>
<li><p>Just like the trampler challenge, but slightly harder.  Just make sure your aim is good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Spurflints Hunting Grounds:</em></p>

<p>(For this hunting ground I would recommend obtaining the stealth armor and using stealth modifications to maximize stealth capabilities.)</p>

<p>Watch Out Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find and Kill Watchers Silently</p></li>
<li><p>Before activating trial, allow yourself to take note of all the watcher locations, once you have a good idea where they are, and stealth kill 4 of them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Stalker Kill Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find and Kill Stalkers</p></li>
<li><p>Scan a stalker before this trial in order to learn of their weak points.  Look for red bombs around the area, and there should be a stalker nearby. Take out their stealth generator as quickly as possible to shorten time consumption on these enemies</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sleight of Crate Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Loot Shell-Walker Crates</p></li>
<li><p>This is where high stealth stat comes in handy, with enough stealth, you can just walk right to the crates without causing attention from the machines.  Be quick</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Sun Furrows Hunting Grounds:</em></p>

<p>(I would recommend finishing the ZETA Cauldron before attempting these missions)</p>

<p>Ravager vs Machines Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove and use a Ravager Cannon to Kill Machines</p></li>
<li><p>Use tearblast arrows or any other arrow with high tear damage to remove their cannons. A afterwards, pick them up and kill ravagers, watchers, or if youâre feeling lucky the Thunderjaw</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thunderjaw vs. Ravager Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove a Thunderjaw Disc Launcher to Kill Ravagers</p></li>
<li><p>This is where the ZETA Cauldron completion will come in handy, you do not need to remove the Disc Launchers, but just override the Thunderjaw, and help him kill both Ravagers.</p></li>
<li><p>If ZETA Cauldron is not complete, use tearblast arrows or any other arrow with high tear damage on the Thunderjaws Disc Launchers, and kill both ravagers with it. (You do not need to kill the Thunderjaw)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ravager Control Trial</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Override Ravagers and Kill the Thunderjaw</p></li>
<li><p>High stealth stat is recommended to quickly override both Ravagers (overriding both is required), help them kill the ravager. (It does not matter who get the final blow)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cauldrons:</strong></p>

<p>SIGMA - Located at the north of the center of the map in the Sacred Lands (you will obtain a quest in Mothers Crown)(Recommended level 10)</p>

<p>RHO - Located slight southwest from Daytower (Recommended level 15)</p>

<p>XO - Located southernmost part of Carja Teritory (Recommended level 20)</p>

<p>ZETA - Located in the north center of Carja Teritory (Recommended level 30)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Corrupted Zones:</strong></p>

<p>-Should be located on the world map. 11 in total</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Collectibles:</strong></p>

<p>To find these, you must obtain a Collectables map from a merchant.  The earliest I found was the merchant outside of Mothers Watch after the fight with the corrupter.</p>

<p>With the map, all the locations for the Banuk Figure, Metal Flower, Ancient Vessel, Vantage should become available on the world map.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Banuk Figures usually require a climb to reach</p></li>
<li><p>Metal Flowers are always located in a triangle of flowers, they can be found with the focus</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient Vessels are always located in piles of Debris, usually with a purple icon over them.  They can be found with the focus</p></li>
<li><p>Vantages usually require a climb to reach to, you must use the focus to obtain them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>For the Weapons and Outfits, it is recommended to get the Scavenger and/or Scavenger+ skills to have an easier time farming ingredients.</em></p>

<p><em>You can also find some ingredients like machine hearts from the merchant close to the palace in Meridian</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
