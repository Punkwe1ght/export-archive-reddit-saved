<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know in my baking journey, there have been several epiphanies that significantly improved my baking and results. I thought it&#39;d be cool to share these with other bakers in case they may help others get over some humps, and I&#39;d also love to hear your epiphanies so I can learn as well! </p>

<p>My Top 5: </p>

<ul>
<li>Mix and knead dough in the same bowl (Tartine does this, and it&#39;s also described in the Pain a l&#39;ancienne from Bread Baker&#39;s Apprentice).</li>
<li>Cold fermentation! Also learned from Pain a l&#39;ancienne in Bread Baker&#39;s Apprentice.</li>
<li>Autolyse -- I always used to skip it in my early years, but omg does it make a difference.</li>
<li>Baking in Dutch ovens -- Started doing it a while ago, but perfectly described in Tartine. It makes an ENORMOUS difference in how the bread looks and springs in the oven.</li>
<li>And, of course, getting into sourdough/wild yeast. Specifically, though, realizing that wild yeast isn&#39;t just for making bread sour, but can be used for everything to provide an incredible depth of flavor. Made our starter 5 years ago and have never gone back to commercial yeast!</li>
</ul>
