<h2>Are there any grid-like tRPGs out there with a fantasy feel outside of the FFT series, FE series, Tactics Ogre and Triangle Strategy?</h2>

<p>Are there any that are worthy of a playthrough? Primarily for DS, 3DS, Switch or Steam.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooter: Abandoned Children is the best strategic rpg I have played for a long while</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(354)">View full post</button><div id="354" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everything about this game is amazing, from the gameplay to the setting, to the story and replayability. Even the graphics is nice and the animations are really good. It&#39;s only two cons are the grind and the difficulty. Even after I have already beaten the game with the hardest difficult, captured all legendary beasts and collected all skills, wrong decision still cost me half of the team. </p>

<p>If you love a game where the stack is low (you are not saving the world, you are just a bounty hunter/helper of some sorts), deep and wide character builds, as difficult as you want it to be with rewards for those who want to challenge themselves, nice graphics and nice soundtracks, good anime-style story and colorful cast of characters then I totally recommend this game to you.</p>

<p>Btw, Carter is 100% using K&#39; (KoF) animation and the ost is suspicious similar to &quot;Conan the famous detective&quot; anime op.</p>
