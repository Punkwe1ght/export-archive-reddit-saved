<h2>What would be an average meal in 1898 America? Please excuse my weird scenario.</h2>

<button onclick="toggles(626)">View full post</button><div id="626" class="mdwrapper"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would just like to preface this by saying the story is probably not at all accurate, i’m merely using it to set the scene for my question…</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re a young man in 1898 America. You’ve been blessed with luck and didn’t have to go work at the age of 11, instead coming from a modest background which valued your education (and all of your limbs). You’ve moved from your home in New England and stepped off the platform in a hazy and chaotic Pittsburgh. Your new job at Carnegie Steel means you’ll soon be earning $2 a day as a timekeeper at one of the most important companies in American history. While you may not be Duquesne Club rich just yet, you can still afford a room for yourself and buy dinner before starting work in two days. </p>

<p>My question then is, where do you go? You’re not exactly rich and can’t afford quail with a bottle of wine, but you’re also not destitute living off a few stale pieces of bread per day. Where does one go for food in 1898 Pittsburgh when the boardinghouse doesn’t cook but some of the restaurants are out of our price range? And what would that meal look like?</p>

<p>Thank you all for indulging my silly stories and question!</p>

How long they were aged in what types of barrels? Where they peated? Do we actually know anything about how the spirits of those 200-300 years old distilleries actually tasted a few centuries ago?</p>
