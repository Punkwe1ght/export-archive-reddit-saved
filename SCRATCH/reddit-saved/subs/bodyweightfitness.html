<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <strong>guys!</strong></p>

<p>Introducing <strong>Bodyweight Fitness (formerly Fit for Reddit)</strong>, a <strong>mobile app</strong> created for <a href="/r/bodyweightfitness">/r/bodyweightfitness</a>. Bodyweight Fitness is an <strong>open source</strong>, <strong>free</strong> and <strong>no adverts</strong> mobile application for <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> (Work in Progress, 2 - 3 weeks).</p>

<p>I have started working on this app couple of months ago but because of personal reasons I had to stop and focus on work and family. Less than a week ago, I decided to finish it as you can see from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3b658h/fitloopco_goes_open_source/csjadph">this comment.</a></p>

<p>The inspiration for this app is <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> amazing Fitloop. I have discovered this subreddit months ago (Or even years now) but started working out after Fitloop helped me to understand the routine.</p>

<p>Today I want to bring this contribution forward and present you the application, here is an album presenting how it looks like at th emoment:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/tWSDu">http://imgur.com/a/tWSDu</a></p>

<p>The app is not meant to replace fitloop! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love fitloop and what <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> did. My goal is to talk to <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> and see how in next few months we can work together to create a login/signup in the app that uses fitloop credentials etc.</p>

<p>The app is Open Source but at the moment source is out of date. Going to push Android Code tomorrow, iOS is currently in the works and hopefully I can finish it in next 2 weeks. I also have to choose apropriate license.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the money from Pro version going?</strong></p>

<p>As you know fitloop is sponsored by links to Amazon as <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> does not accept donations.</p>

<p>I have chosen to create Pro version as a form of donation. I hate having adverts in the app and I think it destroys the design and user experience. Both Free and Pro versions will always (ALWAYS) be the same when it comes to functionality. This is purely done to accept some kind of donation that is not too much.</p>

<p>Part of the money would go towards Apple Developer License for one year which is £79. I haven&#39;t published anything on iOS yet so this is going to be one of the costs in next few weeks.</p>

<p>As I love this subreddit and it&#39;s community, I am going to be honest. My ultimate goal is to be able to gather some money for an engagement ring for my amazing girlfriend. I know she will never read this post so I am free to say it.</p>

<p><strong>What about bugs?</strong></p>

<p>Please report anything you can find by private message on reddit <a href="/u/mazurio">/u/mazurio</a></p>

<p>Otherwise you can use email that can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mazurio">https://github.com/mazurio</a></p>

<p><strong>What is coming next?</strong></p>

<p>I want to keep the app simple but add features over time, here is the timeline.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Android Wear Support.</p></li>
<li><p>Each exercise in the app will also link to Fitloop for more information and YouTube video. As you can see, those Gifs are simple but not perfect. Most of the videos are more than 10 minutes long with explanations.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to hide videos and change layout of the app (some people want to see the timer but not the video).</p></li>
<li><p>Log your workouts (I can either make it simple like fitloop or add overall time from each workout).</p></li>
<li><p>Notifications, this is 90% done as this was one of the first features I have started working on. You will be able to choose notifications you can get through weeks (e.g. Set my Workout days to Monday/Wednesday/Friday and get reminders). It will also remind abuot <a href="/r/bodyweightfitness">/r/bodyweightfitness</a> specific events such as Moronic Monday etc.</p></li>
<li><p>More personalisation and settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe me and <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> can discuss naming apps Fitloop rather than Bodyweight Fitness? What do you guys think?</p></li>
<li><p>I am not a designer and I think logo at the moment looks quite bad. I would love to see someone make a contribution and create a nice, material logo for both iOS and Android versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Create your own routines, modify existing routines. This is just an idea for now but it also depends on what <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> says.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please tell me what do you guys think, I will keep working on the apps for both Android and iOS as I really enjoy it.</p>

<p>Those apps are created for this community, please read the comment from <a href="/u/Antranik">/u/Antranik</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3b658h/fitloopco_goes_open_source/csjmqmo">here.</a></p>

<p>I would love to see this sub participate in their own open source project to make things even better.</p>

<p>Hope you love it,
<strong>mazurio</strong></p>

<p><strong>Too perfect to be true</strong></p>

<p>Google has reject &quot;Fit for Reddit&quot; logo and name so I have rebranded it quickly so I can release it today (now it&#39;s called Bodyweight Fitness), I really hope <a href="/u/imanateater">/u/imanateater</a> can agree so apps would be called Fitloop. Can a good redditor come up with a new, good looking logo?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As of today (13th July), iOS version of the application is DONE and is going to be submitted into the store in couple of hours. It usually takes around 9 days to get approved so fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Also Android Update is coming out today!</p>

<p><strong>iOS is out:</strong>
