Obviously the Grimes boiler room set is the best ever, but sadly we&#39;ll never get to see that.</p>

<p>The rules are simple: Post at most <strong>two</strong> tracks that you have been listening to recently, it doesn&#39;t matter how new/old/well known the track is either. Please link the tracks in your comment if possible.</p>

<p>Maybe include a little tidbit of why you like it as well if you want.</p>

As of late I&#39;ve been feeling down and lonely, but my current songs lead me to reflect on my life and what I&#39;ve done which doesn&#39;t do much to help the situation. So I come to you <a href="/r/futurebeats">/r/futurebeats</a>, can you recommend me happier tunes?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve been obsessed with producers that create great textures. Guys like Nicholas Jaar, Jon Hopkins, Teebs, Limalo, Shlohmo, etc.  I don&#39;t what it is, but there&#39;s something so intimate and attention grabbing about songs that put you in a place/mood right from the start with abstract sounds. Anyone else feel this way about certain producers/songs? </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just curious if anyone on here frequents any other sites for new music? I feel like this sub is a group of people that all follow the same select artists on Soundcloud and post every new release. It is truly rare that I come across something I haven&#39;t seen before, or wouldn&#39;t see the second I open my Soundcloud. If anyone has any suggestions or other means of finding cool music or even up-and-coming artists that&#39;d be awesome! Good vibes all!!</p>
